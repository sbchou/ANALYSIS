"After disappointing Super Tuesday, Kasich turns focus to Midwestern states",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/9BKJqXiKRow/after-disappointing-super-tuesday-kasich-turns-focus-to-midwestern-states.html,fox,3/1/2016 23:04:00,,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich maintained that the Republican presidential race was moving to his ""home court"" after a series of largely disappointing results in the Super Tuesday contests. 
Kasich had followed up a second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary with back-to-back fifth-place finishes in the South Carolina primary and the Nevada caucuses. On Tuesday, strong performances in Vermont and Massachusetts were canceled out by distant finshes in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Oklahoma. 
In a speech to supporters in Mississippi, Kasich used a college basketball analogy to discuss his plan for the upcoming races. 
""We're almost to March Madness,"" Kasich said, ""and you know what they all struggle for, home court advantage.
""We're heading north right on to my home court with Michigan, and then, I’ll tell you now, we will beat Donald Trump in the state of Ohio.""
Michigan holds its primary March 8, with Ohio voting March 15. A total of 125 delegates are at stake in the two Rust Belt states. However, at least one recent poll has shown Kasich trailing Trump among Republican voters in the Buckeye State, while most Michigan polls show Trump in the lead by double digits.
Even if Kasich does pull off the double victory, it's unclear how he would capture enough delegates to catch Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, both of whom were the only Republican candidates to win on Tuesday."
Bernie Sanders campaign raises $42M in February,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/ONp9mL7oguQ/bernie-sanders-campaign-raises-42m-in-february.html,fox,3/1/2016 7:58:00,,"Ahead of a possible make-or-break Super Tuesday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign announced that it had raised more than $42 million in February.
Sanders' campaign claimed the total was the most raised in a single month by any of the 2016 candidates, adding that the self-described democratic socialist had received more than $6 million in donations on the final day of the month. 
“Not only are we going to smash Secretary [Hillary] Clinton’s personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in a statement.
Sanders' campaign has made much of its reliance on small donations, and the candidate himself has contrasted his comparatively shoestring fundraising operation with the far wealthier Clinton campaign. 
Since thumping Clinton by 20 points in the New Hampshire primary, Sanders has seen his fortunes fade. He suffered a narrow loss in the Nevada caucuses and a blowout defeat in Saturday's South Carolina primary.
Even Sanders' wife, Jane, admitted Monday that her husband's campaign faces a ""rough map"", with most of Tuesday's nominating contests taking place in states expected to favor Clinton. However, Sanders has vowed to carry on his run through this summer's Democratic convention."

The retired neurosurgeon did not officially suspend his campaign, saying he’ll discuss the “future of this movement” during a speech Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
But he made clear he’s stepping to the side as the four other Republican candidates continue to wage a battle for the GOP nomination.  
 “I have decided not to attend the Fox News GOP Presidential Debate tomorrow night in Detroit,” he said in a statement Thursday. “Even though I will not be in my hometown of Detroit on Thursday, I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America. I do not see a political path forward in light of last evening’s Super Tuesday primary results.

He enjoyed a surge in the polls last year, at one point becoming competitive with Donald Trump. But he has not won a single contest, and was solidly in last place in the delegate count following Super Tuesday. "

XXX projects that Donald Trump will win three more states in the Super Tuesday contests, while Hillary Clinton will win two more.

On the Democratic side, Clinton is projected to win Alabama and Tennessee by a wide margin.
The race in Oklahoma and Massachusetts is too close to call, though Bernie Sanders has a slight lead over Clinton in both states. 
The four states are the latest where polls have closed while Super Tuesday voting continues elsewhere. 
ORIGINAL STORY ... 
XXX projects Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will easily win the delegate-rich Georgia primaries – while Bernie Sanders, as expected, is projected to win his home state of Vermont. 
Clinton is also projected to win Virginia in the Democratic Super Tuesday race. The GOP side is too close to call, with Trump and Marco Rubio battling for first place, comfortably ahead of Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson.
Polls have closed in those three states, while Super Tuesday voting is under way elsewhere. 
But the biggest electoral prize of this hour is Georgia. On the GOP side, Rubio and Cruz are battling for second place, while Trump is projected to win by a comfortable margin. 
It’s also too early to call the Republican race in Vermont, where Kasich, who campaigned heavily there, is surprisingly competitive with Trump. 
Collectively, the Super Tuesday contests mark the biggest day of primary season voting to date. 
Early Republican race exit polls are reflecting deep voter discontent across the country, with many saying they’re looking to an outsider to be the next president – though some are still uncomfortable with the idea of an outsider like Trump claiming the Republican nomination.
Meanwhile, late-deciders in several states appeared to be breaking for Rubio, including in Virginia and Oklahoma. But Cruz was getting the lion’s share of support from voters looking for someone “very conservative.”
With polls starting to close, primary front-runners Clinton and Trump are aiming to rack up a daunting delegate lead and pull far away from their rivals in the nomination race.
The stakes are high.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates are up for grabs – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination.
And on the Democratic side, Clinton and Vermont Sen. Sanders are battling for 865 delegates in 11 states – roughly a third of the number needed to clinch the nomination.
Clinton entered Super Tuesday with a head of steam following her landslide win over Sanders in South Carolina this past Saturday. She hopes her “firewall” of black voters holds up in several delegate-rich Southern states Tuesday, as she moves to sideline the still-popular Sanders from the race. 
Sanders, though, savored his home-state win all the same, rallying cheering supporterse in Vermont Tuesday evening. 
""It is good to be home,"" he said, before shifting to his stump speech slams against a ""corrupt campaign finance system."" 
Barring a seismic shift in voter sentiment, Trump also is expected to dominate the Republican primary field Tuesday, adding to his already-sizable delegate lead – but Rubio and Cruz are battling fiercely for second, hoping to be the definitive alternative to take on Trump in what could be a bruising, to-the-convention fight for the future of the party.
Ohio Gov. Kasich, who's expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
“Super Tuesday was never anything that we ever thought was going to be some great thing for us,” Kasich openly acknowledged to XXX earlier Tuesday.
Cruz is the odds-on favorite in his home state of Texas – which, with 155 delegates, is the biggest prize of the night. In a sign of his expectations, Cruz planned his election night party in Stafford, Texas.
But because delegates can be allocated proportionally in the Super Tuesday contests, Rubio and Cruz both want to rack up a substantial number of second-place finishes.
A Rubio campaign aide told XXX they are ""focused on only one thing today: delegates.""
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, but the senator vowed to go to all 50 states in a bid to thwart his presidential run.
In the run-up to Tuesday, Cruz and Rubio both have stepped up their attacks on the front-runner, resorting to the kinds of personal insults and attacks that have defined Trump’s campaign style.
Rubio defended the new tack in an interview with XXX.
“Every now and then, someone like that needs a taste of their own medicine because that's called a bully and he’s using the pulpit of the presidency or the presidential run to insult people,” Rubio said.
Cruz told XXX that while Trump will have a “big chunk of delegates” come Wednesday morning, “We're going to have a big chunk of delegates, and there's going to be a huge drop off for everybody else.”

Bernie Sanders.
XXX projected Sanders winning his home state of Vermont and Oklahoma.
XXX exit polls show Clinton winning primaries in the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states of Georgia, Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, Massachusetts and Tennessee. She made her acceptance speech in Florida, ahead of the key March 15 primary there.
Sanders' path to the Democratic nomination, which gained momentum in previous weeks, fell flat Tuesday. Mathematically, he can still make his party’s nomination but it will be an uphill climb.
Sanders told supporters in Vermont he’s up for the challenge and vowed to keep fighting until the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July.
“This campaign is not just about electing a president. It is about transforming America,” Sanders said Tuesday night at a rally in Essex Junction, Vt. “It is about making our great country a nation it has the potential to be.”
Sanders added that the election is about “dealing with some unpleasant truths” and “having the guts to confront those truths.”
In a verbal jab at Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Clinton told a cheering crowd of supporters that the goal was not to “make American great again” but to “make America whole again.”
Going into Super Tuesday, Clinton ran 30 points ahead of Sanders in Georgia, and 20 points ahead in Virginia.
Democrats in 11 states weighed in on whom they want on the November ballot. Clinton aimed for a clean sweep of six states, while Sanders set his sights on five states, including two with caucuses.
Tuesday was the busiest day on the primary calendar so far. For Democrats, 859 delegates will be up for grabs – more than a third of the 2,383 needed to clinch the nomination.
Sanders started the day by casting a ballot for himself in Vermont and said he felt “great” about his prospects.
“After a lot of deliberation, I know that Bernie Sanders here in Vermont got at least one vote,” Sanders joked to reporters with his wife Jane by his side. “I was working on my wife. So I probably got two. So we are feeling pretty good.”
Clinton spent her morning talking to local residents at a Minneapolis coffee shop and local market. She was expected to spend the evening in Miami.
Clinton’s victory over Sanders in the southern states hinged on turning out the states’ large black population. About 4 in 10 voters in Georgia's Democratic primary were black, and about 8 in 10 of them favored Clinton. That mirrors her strong showing among black voters in South Carolina over the weekend."

At the top of that list, in both primary contests, is Texas. The Lone Star State has the biggest cache -- 222 Democratic delegates and 155 for Republicans.  
And perhaps no candidate is fighting harder for that prize than Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The senator went all out on Monday, holding rallies in voter-rich Dallas, Houston and San Antonio in hopes of at least defeating national front-runner Donald Trump in Cruz's home state. 
“We are going to have a very good Super Tuesday,” Cruz assured the Dallas crowd. Cruz has maintained a polling lead in the state, but knows a surprise loss there could doom his campaign.  
For Republicans, the second-biggest prize is Georgia, with 76 delegates at stake. Both Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio put in face time with voters Monday in the final hours before polls open, while Cruz stayed rooted in Texas.  
On the Democratic side, too, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have focused their efforts. 
While Clinton declared Saturday night after her decisive win in the South Carolina primary that the campaign was going “national,” the former secretary of state was concentrating Monday on two delegate-heavy states -- the Democratic-stronghold of Massachusetts (91 delegates) and Virginia (95 delegates).
Solid wins there and beyond on Super Tuesday could give her a nearly insurmountable delegate count toward the nomination. 
Clinton to date leads Sanders in the delegate count 543-to-85, including so-called superdelegates. They will compete for 865 delegates on Tuesday and a total of roughly 1,800 delegates over the next two weeks, with 2,382 needed to win the nomination. 
The delegates on the line in a dozen states Tuesday represent a third of those needed to clinch the party nod. 
And on the GOP side, 595 delegates are on the line Tuesday across 11 states -- nearly half the number needed to secure the nomination. 
Sanders is focusing on Minnesota and Colorado, progressive states where he hopes his message of social and economic equality will translate into votes.
“Americans don’t need crumbs, they need the whole loaf,” Sanders said at a rally in Minneapolis.
He is expected on Tuesday to win his home state of Vermont, which has 16 Democratic delegates. Minnesota is worth far more, with 77 delegates. 
Still, many of these contests divide delegates proportionally, and so Sanders is poised to walk away with some, even where he loses. His strategy appears to be to at least survive Tuesday, with hopes of a resurgence later this month in Maine and Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio.
On the Republican side, Trump has won three straight -- the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, and the Nevada Republican Caucus -- garnering 82 delegates.
Cruz kicked off the 2016 balloting by winning the Iowa Republican Caucus. He has 17 delegates, ahead of Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio with 16.
Though trailing in Texas, Trump holds big leads in other delegate-rich Super Tuesday states.
The billionaire businessman leads by double-digits in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia, according to RealClearPolitics poll averages. Rough 53 percent of the GOP’s 595 delegates on Tuesday are in those states.
Those polls were released before Trump over the weekend initially declined to disavow the backing of former KKK leader David Duke, which Rubio says makes him “unelectable.” 
Trump has since disavowed the support and blamed a supposedly faulty earpiece for his original handling of the question. 
The tough race is taking a toll on the candidates. Rubio, barnstorming the South to take hold of the GOP establishment mantle, temporarily lost his voice at a rally outside of Atlanta and needed South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has endorsed him, to take the microphone.
The two other GOP candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have six and four delegates, respectively."

Ted Cruz jointly turned up the pressure on Marco Rubio to drop out -- though the Florida senator insists he remains a contender and is ""optimistic"" about turning the race around once his home state votes.
Trump won seven states in Tuesday’s contests, bringing his delegate count to 316. Cruz, who won three states, now has 226 delegates. Rubio, with one state win and some second- and third-place finishes, brings his tally to 106. 
For Rubio, he's eyeing the March 15 primary in his home state of Florida as the game-changer. 
But at least until then, Trump and Cruz are working to sideline him. 
At his rally in Texas, Cruz urged voters to unite behind his campaign, warning that Trump is on a glide path to the nomination until that happens.
""So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation,"" he said. ""And, after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
He strongly suggested to reporters that Rubio should reconsider his presence in the race. 
Trump, who has openly mocked Rubio for everything from excessive sweating to drinking water on camera, vowed to beat the senator in his home state. 
With 10 furled American flags and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie standing behind him, Trump poked fun at Rubio, referring to him as “the little senator” and “a lightweight.” 
""It was a very tough night for Marco Rubio,"" Trump said. 
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, while stopping just short of repeating the call at his press conference. But he said, ""You've got to be able to win something.""
Shortly afterward, Rubio did notch his first victory in Minnesota. But he stresses that what matters is the delegates, and he's still adding to his tally.  
Rubio, who has repeatedly called Trump a “con artist” and slammed Cruz for not performing better on Super Tuesday, told XXX he’s not going anywhere.  
“Sixty-five percent of the people who voted yesterday across Super Tuesday did not vote for Donald Trump,” Rubio said. “He underperformed in virtually every state of the map.”
Rubio also had sharp words for Cruz.
“Let’s not forget that last night was supposed to be Ted Cruz’s big night. It was the night where he was going to sweep. The states were tailor made for the kind of campaign he was running. We beat him in Georgia. We beat him in half the states on the map.”
Rubio said the delegate counts will level out in upcoming winner-take-all primaries.  Rubio said he expects to win all of Florida’s 99 delegates up for grabs in the March 15 primary.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates were up for grabs Tuesday – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the GOP race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, has defended his continued presence in the race.
“People have asked for somebody who is not a politician, who was a member of we the people, who has an outstanding life of achievement and who thinks the way they do,” he told XXX."

Tech giants Google and Twitter have teamed with the Associated Press to launch AP Election Buzz, a tool for tracking online activity during the election.
Powered by Google Trends and Twitter, the tool’s charts show Google search interest in political terms, and election-related conversation on Twitter. The Google political index measures search interest in a list of 2016 election topics, such as presidential candidates, policy issues and current events. Twitter election conversation analyzes tweets containing data such as candidate names, campaign hashtags and other election-related terms. Both charts use Iowa caucus day on Feb.1 as a baseline.

""Spikes typically coincide with political events, such as debates, primaries and caucuses, though they may occur at different times on Google and Twitter, in part because the measurements differ,"" explained AP. “The Twitter numbers measure what people are saying online, while Google search data reflect what people want to find or learn about.”
Citing Google Trends data, the tool reports that Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump accounted for 59.3 percent of search interest in the past 24 hours, ahead of his Democratic counterparts Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton with 13.3 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively. Trump was also the main driver of conversation on Twitter, accounting for 58.4 percent of conversation, compared to Sanders’ 14.2 percent and Clinton’s 12.8 percent.

GOP nomination fight rumbles forward,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/pGCX-p1GQlU/gop-nomination-fight-rumbles-forward.html,fox,3/2/2016 14:57:00,,"GOP NOMINATION FIGHT RUMBLES FORWARD The Republican Party is getting ready to do something it has never done before.  The GOP is either going to nominate a candidate that has run his entire campaign against the party itself or it will unite around the goal of denying that candidate a win.  Donald Trump’s Super Tuesday performance was good – certainly good enough that if he was a conventional candidate, he would already be the presumptive nominee. But it wasn’t the knockout that he and his supporters had hoped for.  Trump racked up big wins in his strongholds but lost four of 11 contests. More significant than the win/loss record for the night is the delegate count. And in that measure, little changed.  After Tuesday’s contests, Trump is forecast to gain only about 20 delegates in his lead over Sen. Ted Cruz. Even with more than a quarter of the 2,340 delegates already allocated, a 20-delegate bump isn’t much. But, again, if Trump was an ordinary frontrunner, it would still be enough to break down resistance among the holdouts.  But Trump is not ordinary. Rather than acceptance, the despair among conservative and establishment Republicans is deepening; conservatives for fear of the dissolution of their movement, establishmentarians for fear of polls that show a general election wipeout that crushes the party all the way down the ballot.  Trump’s general election strategy is a comfort to his supporters and to some anxious Republicans. His argument that his mix of showmanship and left-right hodgepodge of positions can win enough blue-collar Democrats to pull off a victory goes against consistent head-to-head polling that shows him at a substantial deficit to presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  For most Republicans, however, this morning brought uncertainty and anxiety. The two choices facing the GOP seem unthinkable for a party that has long prided itself on orderly nominations. No nominee has gone to the Republican convention without enough delegates to win outright in 40 years, and there hasn’t been a floor fight at a convention in 68 years.  But the choices couldn't be clearer today. Option one: a quick capitulation to Trump’s takeover bid. Option two: push forward into an intentionally messy delegate fight and likely a contested convention.  The uncomprehending look on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s face as he stood behind Trump during the front runner’s election-night speech said it all for a party that has been forced to confront realities heretofore unimaginable.  When he backed Trump, Christie no doubt imagined himself the vanguard of an establishment that would make the best of an unusual nominee and get busy trying to save the general election.  That may yet happen, and Christie may look like a guy who bought Apple stock at $22 a share in 1980 instead of how he looked Tuesday: like a guy who accidentally walked in on a cockfight. But he will at least have to wait a while longer for his revenge.  Conventional wisdom says that Republicans will fall in line and accept the reality of having a populist renegade as their party’s standard bearer. With all people, the path of least resistance is usually the safest bet. In politics, it is doubly so.  But the establishment and conservatives will act out of mutual self-interest for the next two weeks and do as their respective champions, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, did in their remarks Tuesday night and focus their fire on Trump.  Every year, trailing candidates and hyperventilating pundits talk breathlessly about open conventions and floor fights. And for 40 years they have been wrong. But this time, it’s fully in the realm of possibility.  The best news for Trump out of Tuesday is that it seems far less likely that he will face a single opponent with unified support before the contests switch to winner-take-all on March 15.  Cruz had a very good night; more than good enough to erase his troubles of the previous two weeks. The problem for Cruz is that Tuesday was the best day on the primary calendar for him. Southern Republicans intentionally frontloaded their contests in a bid to give a favorite son a boost in the early going. It worked. But now Cruz faces many tough contests in more moderate states outside the South.  Marco Rubio had a long night. He notched his first victory but fell short in Virginia and now trails Cruz substantially in the delegate count. For Rubio, however, the road looks smoother from here. While he faces a make-or-break test two weeks from now in Florida, Rubio can at least say that his hardest day on the calendar is behind him.  That’s all good news for Donald Trump in the sense that neither Cruz nor Rubio came out of the night as the consensus favorite for the rest of the party.  But the bad news for Trump is that the emphasis for the party has shifted away from picking a nominee and toward blocking a nominee. The next two weeks will see an all-out assault on Trump with the aim of letting voters check their assumptions one more time and perhaps denying Trump the delegates he needs to win outright.  It’s going to get weird out there, America. "
Gretchen's Take: Shorter calendar strategy is helping Trump,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/y0DtjtCS9Ms/gretchens-take-shorter-calendar-strategy-is-helping-trump.html,fox,3/2/2016 14:43:00,,"There's no doubt Donald Trump came out the big winner on the GOP side last night for Super Tuesday -- and all of that is certainly not sitting well with the Republican establishment. However, it reminds me of the phrase, “be careful what you wish for”. hoping to avoid a repeat of the messy fight for the republican nomination in 2012, the party drew up a calendar intended to allow a front-runner to wrap things up quickly. 
The GOP primary season started a month later this year, Iowa was February 1st instead of January 3rd in 2012.
The process will also end a month earlier with the 2016 GOP convention set for July 18th, instead of the last week in August.
In 2014 the Republican National Committee, also known as, the RNC, decided to compress the primary calendar too moving up the winner-take-all states to March 15th.
Certainly the shorter calendar strategy was set up to favor the establishment candidate. Never did anyone envision the candidate most helped in amassing a lot of delegates quickly would be named Donald Trump.  "
Hillary’s on a roll but she’s still unloved and untrusted. And that’s a big problem,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/pbY3tQeDEeM/hillary-s-on-roll-but-s-still-unloved-and-untrusted-and-that-s-big-problem.html,fox,3/2/2016 19:05:00,,"Hillary Clinton had a Super Tuesday, winning seven of eleven states. In her victory speech, she promised to “Make America Whole,” slamming Donald Trump for dividing the country.
The New York Times was practically giddy with relief that Clinton had triumphed, thus kneecapping the quixotic but popular Bernie Sanders.
The Times was equally joyous to report a “deep chasm” dividing the GOP, claiming the Republican Party was “falling apart.”
Nowhere did the Times mention the most stunning aspect of the primary season to date. Far from falling apart, GOP participation is growing like topsy, while the number of people turning out to vote Democratic has cratered.
In Texas, about 2.8 million Republicans turned out, about twice the number in 2012. That’s in sharp contrast to the Democrats, where 1.4 million votes were cast, about half the number in 2008.
In Massachusetts, nearly 20,000 voters quit the Democratic Party in order to sign up for the GOP.  In the four first states to vote, the number of participants on the GOP side was ahead by 26 percent, while Democratic turnout was down across the board.
The GOP may be falling apart, but it’s doing so in a growing tent. Ironically, Donald Trump, who has been scorned for dividing the country, appears to be bringing together a disparate group of Americans tired of liberal policies and fed up with government incompetence. They’ve waited for Democrats to fix what’s broken – for nearly 8 years – and now they’re ready to try something new.
And, they don’t like Hillary Clinton. Clinton may be able to beat a 74-year-old Socialist, but running against Donald Trump will be tough. Word is that her camp thinks facing off against Trump will be a walk in the park. Her husband, who has keen political instincts, knows better.
One warning shot comes from a recent CNN/ORC International poll. Though the survey suggests that Hillary is her party’s preferred candidate – by a margin of 55 percent to 38 percent over Bernie Sanders – it also reveals an “enthusiasm gap” wide enough to drive a houseboat through. This is her challenge.
When asked the question “Compared to previous elections, are you more enthusiastic about voting than usual, or less enthusiastic?” Forty-six percent of registered Democrats said “more enthusiastic” while 42 percent said they were less pumped up. In November 2007, by comparison, 68 percent of Democrats, ecstatic about the possibility of dumping George W. Bush and about Barack Obama’s candidacy, answered that they were more enthusiastic, while only 24 percent said they were less so. The readings are the worst since 2000.
Drilling down, women are overall less excited about this election, as are minorities. The folks most enthusiastic about voting are males and older Americans. Hillary needs young people, minorities and women to rally to her cause -- the old Obama coalition -- if she is to beat the Republican nominee. 
Asking the same question of Republicans, 58 percent say they are more enthusiastic about voting than usual, while only 30 percent responded that they were less excited. Welcome to the Donald Trump effect. Or maybe to the “Seven Years of Obama is Enough” phenomenon.
In this poll, conducted at the end of February, 49 percent of Republicans and right-leaning independents indicate they are behind Trump, the highest level in the past six months. Only 16 percent line up behind Rubio, and 15 percent are for Cruz. This shatters the thought that there were at most 30 to 35 percent of Republicans willing to back the billionaire.  It also shatters the previous record of 41 percent set in late January. Trump’s support has gained steadily since mid-September.
However, it’s not all good news for Trump backers. In another question, respondents are asked if they would support a particular candidate, should he be nominated. While 69 percent say they would “definitely” or “probably” support Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio, only 52 percent say they would line up behind Trump. Worse - only 11 percent say they would definitely not support Cruz and 12 percent won’t back Rubio; a full 35 percent say they will definitely not vote for Trump. Trump will have to mend some fences.
By contrast, if Hillary Clinton is the nominee, 65 percent of Democrats and left-leaning independents surveyed say they will definitely or probably support her; only 20 percent say they absolutely will not.
Though Trump walks away with the overall GOP vote, it looks like backers take a more jaundiced view of the tycoon’s capabilities, while still placing him above his rivals. A slim majority (51 percent) of Republicans thinks Trump would be the most effective at solving the country’s problems; Cruz comes in second in the problem-solving department with 17 percent of the poll. As for handling the duties of commander-in-chief, Trump again leads, but with the confidence of less than half of right-leaning voters.
In assessing who’s most honest and trustworthy, Trump only gets 35 percent of the votes, compared to 22 percent for Carson, 14 percent for Cruz and 13 percent for Rubio. After all the charges and counter-charges that the candidates have flung at each other in recent weeks, a lack of credibility is understandable.
Hillary Clinton flunks the character issue by a huge margin: only 36 percent think she is the most honest and trustworthy candidate, compared to 59 percent that credits Sanders with those characteristics.
This is only one poll, but it’s a revealing snapshot. As the campaigns plow onward, positions may change. However, Hillary’s problems with how voters view her honesty and trustworthiness appear durable.
The same may be true of The Donald.
If the country is presented with two flawed candidates, the “enthusiasm gap” could prove decisive."
Hillary vs. Bernie: It’s time to do the math in a post-Super Tuesday world,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/otkFAiG-3Ic/hillary-vs-bernie-it-s-time-to-do-math-in-post-super-tuesday-world.html,fox,3/2/2016 3:00:00,,"Saturday night’s results in South Carolina were the start of something special for Hillary Clinton.
After a close to 50-point victory there where she garnered the support of over 80 percent of African-American voters, Clinton showed that her tough time in Iowa – where she won by less than half a percentage point – and New Hampshire where Sanders won by over 20 points, are a vague and distant memory.
How distant that memory is was clear Tuesday evening where Clinton won Super Tuesday handedly.  
Sanders had been running ahead in his home state of Vermont throughout the last two months and his big win there is no surprise. He also won Oklahoma and Colorado. He had also been hoping to make a play for Massachusetts.
So what does this mean for the future of the Democratic race?
Not a whole lot in terms of what you’re going to see in the day to day.
Bernie Sanders has made it clear that he will keep going until the convention this summer. He certainly has the money to make good on this promise – Sanders raised an astounding $43 million in February alone – and I have no doubt that he’ll continue raising funds at this level. Like Trump, Sanders has been successfully tapping into voter dissatisfaction and his populist message of addressing income inequality and reining in Wall Street has been deeply resonating with voters.
This isn’t apt to change and the media will continue to report that the momentum is on Sanders’s side as he draws huge crowds and raises millions.
It’s extremely unlikely that Clinton will start winning the youth vote back from him and she will instead focus on keeping the female vote and maintaining her support with the African- American community.
By the looks of it, and the turnout patterns we’ve seen thus far, this is going to be enough for Clinton to continue to on her path to the nomination. And much of this really comes down to the math.
To this end, when Sanders declared Tuesday evening that the contest has only begun because we still have 35 states left to vote, he’s not telling the whole story.
Clinton is amassing a big delegate lead and we know that she’s already far ahead with the Democrat superdelegates where she has the support of over 60 percent of them.
Sanders’s team knows what a tremendous advantage this is for Clinton as they’ve been reportedly trying to persuade superdelegates to reserve judgment until the popular vote totals are in. (This hasn’t been a particularly effective approach thus far).
It follows that, although it isn’t the glitziest way to win an election, Clinton is making it mathematically impossible for Sanders to win the nomination.
The #FeelTheBern movement was a powerful one, but it doesn’t look like it can go all the way."
MEDIA BUZZ Trump has used a general election strategy all along,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/02/middle-ground-how-trump-plotted-general-election-strategy-from-start.html,fox,3/2/2016 10:32:44,,"Donald Trump, whose big Super Tuesday night brings him one step closer to the November ballot, has been running a general election campaign from the beginning.
Trump and his inner circle never advertised this, of course, and are amused by how the media have largely missed the strategy.
While Hillary Clinton, who also had a big day yesterday, had her aides leak details to the New York Times and Washington Post of how she’s planning a general-election assault on Trump, the Republican front-runner has had his eye on the fall since day one.
People familiar with his approach say some strategic elements evolved as the campaign unfolded. There was no 100-page memo plotting it out in advance. But this mindset explains why Trump has done certain things that are wildly unorthodox in a Republican primary race, much to the anger and consternation of leading conservative politicos and pundits.
One linchpin of this strategy came in Trump’s announcement speech, when he stirred controversy by saying that illegal Mexican immigrants included criminals and rapists. That, and his vow to build a wall across the border, gave him credibility with the conservative base. Whenever Trump would take a more moderate stance that might alienate that base, he could just pivot back to his tough immigration stance.
Trump declared early on that there should be no cuts to Social Security and Medicare. That, as his campaign knows full well, is not the standard Republican line. Conservatives believe deeply in shrinking the size of government and that entitlement programs must be reined in because they eat up a major chunk of the budget.
But Democrats have been accusing Republicans of wanting to gut the programs for a generation. Trump’s position—that people paid into the program and deserve to reap the benefits—plays well in a general election, especially since he hopes to peel off some working-class Democrats and independents.
In his press conference last night, Trump again sung the praises of Planned Parenthood, saying he would only defund the group’s abortion services—despite what the “so-called conservatives” think. This may be anathema to conservative Republicans who despise the group and are ardently pro-life. But his stance could appeal to suburban women who might otherwise view a Republican nominee as hostile.
Trump, at his rallies, routinely tries out different narratives and drops the ones that don’t work. But he has settled on a mix of conservative and moderate positions that partially explains why Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio keep attacking him as an inauthentic conservative.
Trump has never run as a doctrinaire right-winger. He has, after all, spoken repeatedly about raising taxes on hedge-fund executives, which is usually a Democratic talking point.
Trump certainly sounded like a general-election candidate last night, taking a more subdued tone and talking about sitting in the Oval Office and making deals with Democrats and Republicans. The press conference setting yielded a more subdued tone—he even said nice things about the press!—and got him 40 minutes of precious cable airtime.
The general-election strategy was also evident in Trump’s travel schedule. While some pundits questions why he wasn’t spending more time in Iowa or New Hampshire, he would jet off for rallies in Alabama and Mississippi or Massachusetts and Vermont. This was in part because he would need those states later in the primaries, but also to lay the groundwork for November.
Most Republican candidates move right during the primaries and then slide to the center a bit during the fall campaign, while Democrats do the opposite. If the Super Tuesday results indeed mean that Trump is close to becoming the party’s standard-bearer, he may not have to pivot as much as most nominees. "

MITT WEIGHS IN  Romney announces speech on state of 2016 race,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/02/romney-to-make-major-speech-on-2016-race.html,fox,3/2/2016 18:58:03,,"Mitt Romney will deliver a major speech on the state of the 2016 race for the White House Thursday, amid rising panic among some Republican leaders that Donald Trump may be cruising to the nomination. 
The 2012 Republican presidential nominee will speak at 11:30 a.m ET from the University of Utah. Exactly what Romney will say was not immediately clear, though there were no signs that Romney would either endorse a candidate or jump into the race himself.
Romney considered another White House run at the beginning of 2015 before deciding against the move, reportedly after being out-raised by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- who has since suspended his campaign.
Despite his decision not to run, there has been widespread media speculation that he could be tempted back into the race in the case of a contested Republican convention as a last gasp way to stop Trump.
The speech comes after Trump racked up a string of Super Tuesday wins, building a wide -- though not insurmountable -- delegate lead over closest rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
The former Massachusetts governor has become increasingly vocal in his opposition to the business mogul.
Last week, Romney told XXX’ Neil Cavuto that he believes there may be a “bombshell” in Trump’s tax returns, and called for Trump to release his returns as soon as possible.
He later criticized Trump for not immediately disavowing the support of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke.
Although Trump did later disavow Duke, Romney called his response “disqualifying and disgusting.”
A disqualifying & disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America.— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 29, 2016

Trump responded to Romney with barbs of his own, calling him ""one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics."""
Presenting your Super Tuesday field guide,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/aofymDhSNyI/presenting-your-super-tuesday-field-guide.html,fox,3/1/2016 17:16:00,,"PRESENTING YOUR SUPER TUESDAY FIELD GUIDE Is this the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end? That’s what Republican voters in 11 states will decide today as they head to the polls and caucuses to determine whether they are content with their frontrunner, Donald Trump, or ready to shake things up.  The only state of the 11deciding today in which Trump does not lead pre-election polls is Texas, where favorite son, Sen. Ted Cruz, seems to have the edge. But elsewhere, it looks like Trump by a mile. In some spots where blue-collar white voters dominate, like Alabama and Massachusetts, Trump’s lead in some polls crosses into the stratosphere.  Overall, however, the shape of the race in the Super Tuesday states looks more like what we saw in Iowa and South Carolina: Trump is ahead but Sens. Marco Rubio and Cruz are within hailing distance and splitting up half of the vote or so.  Let’s consider some scenarios:  Say goodnight - If Donald Trump has been helped rather than hurt by the sustained attacks on his business record and character by Cruz and Rubio, and if the Republican electorate has really accommodated itself to the idea of the celebrity billionaire as its standard bearer, it could all be over by midnight. Should Trump win all 11 contests or dominate 10 and come close in Texas, you can go ahead and call him the presumptive nominee.  A longer road - Past could be prologue for today’s contest, and that’s still good news for Trump overall. If the polls are predictive, which they have mostly been so far, then Trump’s advantage is in the limited success of his rivals. If Trump wins 40 percent of the nearly 600 delegates on the table, but Cruz and Rubio remain knotted behind him, then Trump would continue to march on to victory. It would take longer, but a split decision in the rest of the party would mean continued division and possibly even the continued candidacies of Gov. John Kasich and Ben Carson. This is the one in which we hear a lot of palaver about a brokered convention.  Reset button - It’s only as late in the game as Republican voters think it is. Trump triumphalism, greeted by cheers in some quarters and baleful tears in others, is a state of mind. While nearly a quarter of delegates are on the table today, 71 percent of all delegates will still be untouched on Wednesday morning. There are more delegates available in the two weeks after today, many in winner-take-all contests, than in every contest so far. If Republicans are getting cold feet about Trump and he is losing some of his luster, today could be the hinge on the gate that swings the election into a new phase. Rubio needs a moon shot to pull this off, but that could begin tonight.

TEXAS There are two contests in Texas for the Republicans: One for pride and the other for delegates. Cruz hopes to win both, and will be counting on his neighbors in the Houston metro area to deliver it for him. But Trump should find plenty of good drilling in the vast countryside where lower-income voters dominate. Rubio will be looking to scoop up some delegates from suburban Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin.

One of the reasons that Marco Rubio can be cautiously optimistic about his chances in Virginia is the sustained growth of Charlottesville and the University of Virginia. Previous elections saw only three centers of population in the state: The dense suburbs of Northern Virginia, Richmond and its environs, and the industrial Tidewater region. But Charlottesville offers a surprising number of votes and, if other affluent university towns so far this cycle are a guide, fecund ground for Rubio.

The state matches his demographic profile: white, ranked 42nd in adults with college degrees and 41st in median household income. But instead of the Trump smash being forecast in some other similar-seeming states, polls show Trump only 10 points or so ahead. There are a few possible explanations including the expansive, though recently arrested, success of the natural gas industry. But more likely it is this: Oklahoma may be the most politically conservative state in America. The Sooner State sent fiscal disciplinarian “Dr. No,” Tom Coburn (now boosting Rubio) to Congress for as long as he wanted.  --43 delegates     --15 congressional district delegates, three for each of the 5 districts (outright majority win receives all congressional delegates, top three finishers get one delegate each if they receive above 15 percent of the voter)     --28 at-large delegates based on statewide results (outright majority win receives all at-large delegates, if candidates receive 15 percent or above the delegates will be allocated proportionally) --Closed primary --1,334,872 ballots cast in 2012     --Rick Santorum, 34 percent; Mitt Romney, 28 percent; Newt Gingrich, 27 percent; Ron Paul, 10 percent --Polls close at 8 p.m. ET  Oklahoma County: Almost all the marbles Oklahoma City was a boomtown and is still a hub for the region. It’s fast growing southern suburbs, including Moore, ought to see a fairly close split between Rubio and Cruz.  --Population: 766,215 --Median household income: $45,215 --Unemployment: 3 percent --Race: Caucasian, 71 percent; black, 16 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 30 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 13 percent --2012 general election: Romney 58 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 34 percent; Rick Santorum, 31 percent; Newt Gingrich, 23 percent; Ron Paul, 11 percent]

The most votes can be found around Birmingham and Jackson, this demographically split portion of the state offers some interesting wrinkles. But it’s probably Trump, the whole Trump and nothing but the Trump.  --Population: 415,123 --Median household income: $43,028 --Unemployment: 7 percent --Race: Caucasian, 60 percent; black, 35 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 21 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 15 percent --2012 general election: Romney 54 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 36 percent; Rick Santorum, 34 percent; Newt Gingrich, 24 percent; Ron Paul, 5 percent]  ARKANSAS In the greatest film ever set in Arkansas, John Wayne’s “True Grit,” Marshal Rooster Cogburn tells the outlaw Ned Pepper that he means to kill him in “one minute,” or see him hanged in Fort Smith. Pepper, played by Robert Duval, looks at Cogburn’s paunch and declares, “I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man.” You can tell the same to anyone who pretends to know what will happen in the Arkansas Republican Primary.  --40 delegates --12 district delegates, three for each of the state’s four congressional districts (outright majority win receives all the district delegates, if no candidate receives a majority of the vote the candidate with the plurality receives two delegates and the runner up receives one) --28 at-large delegates based on statewide results (each candidate with 15 percent or more receives one delegate and the candidate with the majority receives the rest, if no candidate has a statewide majority the remaining delegates are awarded proportionally to those above 15 percent of the vote) --Closed primary --1,069,468 ballots cast in 2012 --Mitt Romney, 68 percent; Ron Paul, 13 percent; Rick Santorum, 13 percent; Newt Gingrich, 5 percent --Polls close at 8:30 p.m. CST  Pulaski County: Two stories There are two ways to look at Arkansas’ capital, Little Rock, and its county, Pulaski. On one hand, it looks like Trump country, where lots of blue-collar white voters live in close proximity to a significant number of minorities. But it’s also a capital city where there are plenty of upscale voters. There’s a decent chance that the three frontrunners will come out essentially even.  --Population: 392,701 --Median household income: $46,013 --Unemployment: 5 percent --Race: Caucasian, 59 percent; black 36 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 31 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 14 percent --2012 general election: Obama 55 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 71 percent; Ron Paul, 13 percent; Rick Santorum, 12 percent; Newt Gingrich, 4 percent]
Benton County: Company town Politicians in both parties have spent more than a decade pursuing the elusive “Walmart voter.” Well, here’s your chance. The corporate headquarters of America’s largest private employer is here in Bentonville and it is among the most prosperous places in a region not known for its prosperity. This county in the northwest corner of the state could be a hidden gem for Rubio.
--Population: 242,321 --Median household income: $54,515 --Unemployment: 4 percent --Race: Caucasian, 90 percent; black 2 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 29 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 13 percent --2012 general election: Romney 70 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 65 percent; Rick Santorum, 16 percent; Ron Paul, 15 percent; Newt Gingrich, 5 percent]  TENNESSEE You can divide Tennessee into three distinct regions: The Appalachian east, the Cumberland Valley around Nashville in the center, and the Memphis sprawl in the west. The eastern side of the state around Knoxville should be revealing about the relative strengths about Rubio and Cruz. Like the rest of the region, the population and economic center of metro Knoxville should be better for the two senators than elsewhere. The battle and most of the votes, however, will be to the west.  --58 delegates     --27 district delegates three from each of the nine congressional districts (candidate with either 67 percent majority in the district wins all three delegates, if no one reaches that mark candidates with the highest percent of the vote receive two delegates and the runner up gets one delegate so long as they have above 20 percent of the vote)     --31 at-large delegates based on statewide results (candidate with 67 percent of the vote receives all at-large delegates, otherwise delegates are distributed proportionally to those with 20 percent of the vote) --Open primary --2,460,904 ballots cast in 2012     --Rick Santorum, 37 percent; Mitt Romney, 28 percent; Newt Gingrich, 24 percent; Ron Paul, 9 percent --Most polls close at either 7 or 8 p.m. ET (Polls closings vary by county and are split between Eastern and Central time zones)  Williamson County: Moderate twang You probably think of Nashville as Music City. But if you live in Tennessee, you think of it as the state capital, and a large, growing, affluent city that is home to Vanderbilt University and multiple corporate headquarters. As the county stretches out to the south, however, it takes in more blue-collar voters on the other side of Franklin. Like the Northern Virginia suburbs, if Marco Rubio is a contender for 2016 he will do well in Williamson County.  --Population: 205,226 --Median household income: $89,779 --Unemployment: 4 percent --Race: Caucasian, 90 percent; black 5 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 53 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 12 percent --2012 general election:  Romney 73 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 36 percent; Rick Santorum, 32 percent; Newt Gingrich, 23 percent; Ron Paul, 8 percent]  Shelby County: Trump smokes ‘em There’s a lot to like about Memphis and its main suburban county, particularly the blues and barbeque. But if you are Donald Trump there’s even more. The county has some wealthy enclaves, but is dominated in Republican politics by his kind of voter.  --Population: 938,803 --Median household income: $46,250 --Unemployment: 6 percent  --Race: Caucasian, 42 percent; black, 53 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 29 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 12 percent --2012 general election: Obama 63 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Rick Santorum, 37 percent; Mitt Romney, 34 percent; Newt Gingrich, 19 percent; Ron Paul, 8 percent]  MASSACHUSETTS If you thought New Hampshire liked Donald Trump, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. With the same primary setup as New Hampshire that allows independents to vote, a lot of fed-up, blue-collar voters and no particular bent towards conservativism, Massachusetts is maximum Trump. He may get enough votes in Middlesex County alone to carry the state’s primary. Middlesex is the broad swap of urban sprawl on the north side of Boston, part of which was once represented by Trump endorser former Sen. Scott Brown.  --42 delegates     --27 district delegates three for each of the state’s nine congressional districts     --15 at-large delegates     --All delegates allocated proportionally based on statewide results with a five percent threshold --Mixed primary (Republicans and independents can vote in the GOP primary, but not Democrats) --3,167,767 ballots cast in 2012     --Mitt Romney, 93 percent; Unallocated, 7 percent --Polls close at 8 p.m. ET

And that makes things weird. Rick Santorum carried the state in 2012 as he was gamely chasing Romney, even though Minnesota didn’t demographically match Santorum’s other successful areas. The only poll taken this year showed Rubio slightly ahead of Cruz and Trump at the end of January. But who the heck knows? Organization is the key in these small-turnout affairs. Trump showed he could deliver in Nevada, so keep your eyes on the North Star State. Most of the vote will come from Hennepin County in the suburbs of Minneapolis.  --38 delegates     --Candidate with 85 percent or more receives all 38 delegates     --24 district delegates, three from each of the state’s eight districts, will be awarded proportionally to those with a mandatory 10 percent threshold within the district     --14 at-large delegates based on statewide results to those with a mandatory 10 percent threshold --Open caucus --2,936,561 ballots cast in 2012     --Rick Santorum, 45 percent; Ron Paul, 27 percent; Mitt Romney, 17 percent; Newt Gingrich, 11 percent --Polls close at 9 p.m. ET

After a few days on the trail with her candidate Trump, we haven’t heard much from the former Alaska governor. But presumably she should be able to deliver her home state for him. Trump and Palin, however, must beware of the wide streak of establishment Republicanism that runs through Alaska. Even so, the last frontier ought to come in late, but heavy for Trump. Keep your eyes on Mantanuska-Susitna Borough -- the heart of the “Mat-Su Valley” -- that’s where almost all the votes will be.  --28 delegates     --Delegates allocated proportionally with a mandatory 13 percent threshold statewide --Closed caucus --300,495 ballots cast in 2012     --Mitt Romney, 32 percent; Rick Santorum, 30 percent; Ron Paul, 24 percent; Newt Gingrich, 13 percent --Polls close 12 a.m. (March 2nd)  Mantanuska-Susitna Borough: --Population: 97,882 --Median household income: $71,037 --Unemployment: 8 percent --Race: Caucasian, 84 percent; black, 1 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 21 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 10 percent --2012 general election: Romney 55 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 32 percent; Rick Santorum, 30 percent; Ron Paul, 24 percent; Newt Gingrich, 13 percent]  VERMONT We have talked many times this election cycle about the surprising number of voters torn between Trump and Vermont’s socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. While that split was helpful for Trump in neighboring New Hampshire and will be in Massachusetts today, it’s not likely to do much good for Trump in Sanders’ home state. The Green Mountains should fairly ring with the chants of “Feel the Bern!” That won’t leave many disaffected independents for Trump. But there still might be enough. The state’s Republicans tend to have a strong libertarian streak and are social moderates. While Rubio could be expected to do fine here, never count Trump out in the Northeast. The place to watch, not surprisingly, is Burlington’s county: Chittenden.

RACE FOR GOP NOMINATION: Trump builds delegate lead &#8212; but it's no lock,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/02/trump-builds-delegate-lead-but-its-no-lock.html,fox,3/2/2016 20:25:29,,"Donald Trump’s seven Super Tuesday wins helped pad his substantial delegate lead – but not enough to dispirit his top rivals, who still see a path to toppling the Republican front-runner and taking the fight to the convention if necessary.  
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, at the very least, seem determined to compete for every vote through the March 15 contests, which could make for the most consequential night of the GOP campaign.
That’s when the home states of Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich vote. And both states award every delegate on the table to the winner.
“If I win Florida, what does that math look like?” Rubio told XXX on Wednesday, brushing aside pressure to drop out.
Here’s where the delegate math stands now:
It takes 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination. Trump has 319; Cruz has 226; and Rubio has 110.
According to Associated Press estimates, Trump needs to lock down 52 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the party nod.
March 15 may provide the best clue as to whether that’s likely.
On one hand, if Rubio were to win Florida and Kasich were to win Ohio, they would continue to hold down Trump’s numbers even if he wins elsewhere.
On the other, a Trump victory in those states and beyond would truly give him an aura of inevitability – not to mention put immense pressure on Rubio and Kasich to drop out.
Rubio already is facing that pressure from Trump and Cruz, who wants non-Trump voters to unite behind his campaign, which he claims is the only one that can confront and defeat the billionaire businessman.
DELEGATES: WHERE DO CANDIDATES STAND NOW? | InsideGov
“So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation,"" he said Tuesday night. ""And, after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
Cruz and the rest of the candidates will have their next chance to make their case to the American public on Thursday, when they face off for a Fox News debate in Detroit, their first post-Super Tuesday showdown. 
One candidate has already bowed out of the event, Ben Carson -- who, after a disappointing Super Tuesday, announced he sees no ""political path forward,"" while stopping just short of suspending his campaign. The debate Thursday could see Rubio and Cruz ratchet up their fight for the not-Trump mantle, with Rubio clearly lagging right now in the race for second.  
Cruz won in his delegate-rich home state of Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska on Tuesday. Together with his leadoff win in the Iowa caucuses, Cruz has claimed wins in four states.
Rubio, who has seen GOP establishment figures line up behind his campaign especially since Jeb Bush dropped out, has struggled to account for his performance to date.
The senator did claim his first win Tuesday night in Minnesota. And – while touting the fact he’s picked up delegates even in states he didn’t win – he implicitly questioned Cruz’s ability to win in some of the upcoming contests, claiming several states coming up “look more like Virginia” where Rubio beat Cruz in the race for second Tuesday.
He’s referring to states like Illinois and even Michigan, with a more moderate primary electorate.
But Deep South states like Mississippi and Louisiana also are fast-approaching on the calendar.
“There are some states that are going to be favorable to [Cruz],” Cruz supporter and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told XXX. While a voting bloc thought to be Cruz’s strong suit – evangelicals – are still breaking for Trump in some Southern states, Abbott suggested those voters will start shifting soon to Cruz.
One scenario is for Rubio and Cruz to stay in the race if only to prevent Trump from achieving the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
Asked about that possibility, Rubio told XXX “we’re going to do whatever it takes” to prevent the nomination from falling into Trump’s hands – but said the plan is to clinch the nomination, not simply prevent Trump from doing so.
Rubio is putting it all on the line in Florida, meanwhile, vowing Wednesday that he’ll win.
Trump is threatening to crush those hopes, and cites polls that show him well ahead of Rubio.
“We're going to go to Florida. We're going to spend so much time in Florida. We've got about a 20-point lead,” Trump said Tuesday night, at a post-primary press conference in the Sunshine State.
Trump already is positioning himself as a general election candidate, increasingly taking swings at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who also had a good night on Tuesday with seven wins to Bernie Sanders’ four.
But he allowed, with the GOP race still open, that another candidate might also be able to take her on – taking another swipe at Rubio in the process.
“I don't think Marco is going to be able to beat her. …  I think Ted's going to have a very hard time. But Ted at least has a shot because at least he's won a little bit,” Trump said."
Report: Clinton campaign 'reminded' of election law after Bill strolls into polls,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/tP3Hf7XU-CA/report-clinton-campaign-reminded-election-law-after-bill-strolls-into-polls.html,fox,3/1/2016 20:50:00,,"The Clinton campaign was “reminded” of Massachusetts election laws Tuesday after the former president wandered into a Boston school and began shaking hands with voters and polling workers.
According to The Boston Globe, Bill Clinton strolled into the Holy Name Parish School in West Roxbury alongside Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. But state law restricts electioneering (soliciting for or against any person, party or ballot question) within 150 feet of a polling place.
A video shows Clinton shaking hands inside the school gym where the voting was taking place, and reports say he was glad-handing everyone -- even kissing an old woman on the head - and stopped at a bake sale near the entrance and bought a cup of coffee. At one point, according to MassLive.com, he was asked by a woman inside to pose for a picture.

“As long as we’re not violating any election laws,” he said. The report said he spent 45 minutes at the West Roxbury location. It was one of several stops he made in Massachusetts, where his wife was locked in a Super Tuesday primary battle with opponent Bernie Sanders. Massachusetts is one state where the Vermont senator has given the former first lady a fight, according to the polls.
MassLive.com said Bill Clinton did not take press questions, nor did he appear to mention the election. At one point a woman told the former president that she had voted for Republican Ted Cruz, but that her 98-year-old mother voted for Hillary Clinton. He then took a piece of paper out of his pocket and wrote the mother a note.
While the Boston Globe confirmed with the Secretary of State’s office that the campaign had been “reminded” of the 150-foot rule, it was not clear when or where the reminder took place.
When asked by by XXX whether the ex-president was violating election rules, a spokesman for Secretary of State Brian McNiff said simply, “I don't know. He was just in there shaking hands and there's no law against that.""
He did mention that there were problems with traffic being obstructed and ""quite a crowd in New Bedford"" when Clinton stopped there earlier, but it did not shut down the polls."
Romney to make major speech on 2016 race,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/1ZrutPak4iY/romney-to-make-major-speech-on-2016-race.html,fox,3/2/2016 18:18:00,,"Mitt Romney will deliver a major speech on the state of the 2016 race for the White House Thursday, amid rising panic among some Republican leaders that Donald Trump may be cruising to the nomination. 
The 2012 Republican presidential nominee will speak at 11:30 a.m ET from the University of Utah. Exactly what Romney will say was not immediately clear, though there were no signs that Romney would either endorse a candidate or jump into the race himself.
Romney considered another White House run at the beginning of 2015 before deciding against the move, reportedly after being out-raised by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- who has since suspended his campaign.
Despite his decision not to run, there has been widespread media speculation that he could be tempted back into the race in the case of a contested Republican convention as a last gasp way to stop Trump.
The speech comes after Trump racked up a string of Super Tuesday wins, building a wide -- though not insurmountable -- delegate lead over closest rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
The former Massachusetts governor has become increasingly vocal in his opposition to the business mogul.
Last week, Romney told XXX’ Neil Cavuto that he believes there may be a “bombshell” in Trump’s tax returns, and called for Trump to release his returns as soon as possible.
He later criticized Trump for not immediately disavowing the support of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke.
Although Trump did later disavow Duke, Romney called his response “disqualifying and disgusting.”
A disqualifying & disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America.— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 29, 2016

Trump responded to Romney with barbs of his own, calling him ""one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.”"

Barring a seismic shift in voter sentiment, Donald Trump is expected to dominate the Republican primary field on Super Tuesday, adding to his already-sizable delegate lead – but Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are battling fiercely to be the definitive alternative to take on Trump in what could be a bruising, to-the-convention fight for the future of the party.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who's expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday -- though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support -- remains in the race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks.
“Super Tuesday was never anything that we ever thought was going to be some great thing for us,” Kasich openly acknowledged to XXX on Tuesday, also telling Fox Business Network there's ""zero chance"" he'd be anyone's running mate. 
Rubio, too, is looking ahead to the March 15 contest in his home state, even planning to hold his primary night rally there Tuesday.
But first, he’ll need to stay competitive with Cruz in the 11 Super Tuesday states awarding 595 total delegates.
There’s at least one state he stands a decent chance of winning, according to recent polling, and that is Minnesota. Rubio was holding a rally there Tuesday before heading to Miami.
Cruz, meanwhile, is the odds-on favorite in his home state of Texas – which, with 155 delegates, is the biggest prize of the night. In a sign of his expectations, Cruz planned his election night party in Stafford, Texas.
But because delegates can be allocated proportionally in the Super Tuesday contests (provided the winner’s margin of victory is not colossal), Rubio and Cruz both want to rack up a substantial number of second-place finishes.
A Rubio campaign aide told XXX they are ""focused on only one thing today: delegates.""
The polling is varied and in some states sparse, but RealClearPolitics averages show Cruz and Rubio likely are competing closely for second place in Georgia, Tennessee, Oklahoma and elsewhere. Rubio appears to have the edge over Cruz in Virginia and Massachusetts, while Cruz was actually leading one recent poll in Arkansas.
In the run-up to Tuesday, Cruz and Rubio both have stepped up their attacks on the front-runner, resorting to the kinds of personal insults and attacks that have defined Trump’s campaign style.
Rubio defended the new tack in an interview with XXX.
“Every now and then, someone like that needs a taste of their own medicine because that's called a bully and he’s using the pulpit of the presidency or the presidential run to insult people,” Rubio said.
Cruz told XXX that while Trump will have a “big chunk of delegates” come Wednesday morning, “We're going to have a big chunk of delegates, and there's going to be a huge drop off for everybody else.”
Trump, for his part, suggested Tuesday he wants to see Rubio “get out” of the race.
“He hasn’t won anything,” Trump told XXX. As for Rubio’s goal of a big win later this month in Florida, Trump said, “I don’t think right now he could be elected a dogcatcher in Florida.”
Trump wasn’t conceding the race against Cruz for Texas, either.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, defended his continued presence in the race on Tuesday.
“People have asked for somebody who is not a politician, who was a member of we the people, who has an outstanding life of achievement and who thinks the way they do,” he told XXX."

Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are less certain when the GOP presidential primary balloting closes Tuesday night.
The freshman senators are essentially tied for second in roughly half of the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses, including Alabama, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia.
The only delegate-rich state in which they were not second and third was Massachusetts, where Trump leads by 45 points, followed by Rubio at roughly 18 percent, then Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Cruz.
Cruz had a double-digit lead in his home state of Texas, which has 155 GOP delegates up for grabs, the largest number, followed by Georgia with 76.
Cruz has put a lot of resources into Texas, and a loss would be a major blow to his campaign.
Rubio, in a bit of gamesmanship, said, ""Tonight was supposed to be Ted Cruz's big night.""       
Rubio has yet to win an early-voting state and was not ahead in any polling before Tuesday. The other candidate in the GOP race is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is essentially last in polling.
The GOP field was competing Tuesday for a total of 595 delegates.
Cruz, who won the Iowa GOP caucus, has 17 delegates, one more than Rubio.
They have been locked in what has become a battle to win the support of the GOP establishment, which appears increasingly uneasy about Trump’s rogue campaign winning the party nomination.
Trump has 82 delegates after winning three straight contests -- the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries and the Nevada GOP caucus.
Rubio on Tuesday also ceremonially launched his campaign for the must-win primary in his home state of Florida, where Trump is comfortably ahead.
Rubio told reporters in Minnesota that he is looking ahead to the March 15 contest because he will have ""a lot of delegates.""
He's also predicting that the GOP contest will become so fierce that Trump will realize that he has “no chance"" of ever winning enough delegates to capture the party nomination.
Trump on Tuesday was in Kentucky, trying to woo voters at a rally in Louisville by saying President Obama has ""decimated"" the region’s coal industry.
The billionaire businessman said if he becomes president, coal will ""make a very big comeback.""

Many of the races are in Texas, which because of its size has 38 House members -- 27 Republicans and 11 Democrats.
Their outcomes could be influenced by the GOP presidential primary turnout for Sen. Ted Cruz, trying to win his home state and close on front-runner Donald Trump, to say nothing of the general animus toward Washington.  
And groups aligned with Cruz have gone after several House GOP incumbents since he came to Capitol Hill in 2013.
Three chairmen of GOP-led House committees, who are all from Texas, are in competitive races: Reps. Lamar Smith at Science; Pete Sessions at House Rules and Kevin Brady at House Ways and Means, who took the gavel just months ago when Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan became House speaker.
GOP Rep. John Culberson, another Texan, also faces a primary challenge.
He isn’t a full committee chairman. He’s known on Capitol Hill as a “cardinal” because he’s chairman of the influential House Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds Commerce, Justice & Science programs (CJS).
Appropriations subcommittee chairmen are referred to as cardinals because they wield particular eminence over that section of federal spending.
Even Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert, one of the most-conservative House members, faces a primary challenge Tuesday.
GOP incumbents from Alabama are also in close races.
At the top of the list is Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby. He came to Washington as a Democrat, then switched to a Republican after the GOP took control of the upper chamber in 1994.
His record is being criticized amid the Supreme Court debate about whether President Obama should make a nomination to replace the late Antonin Scalia, and whether the GOP-led Senate should block such an effort.
Shelby has been criticized for holding up the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court (who ultimately wasn’t confirmed) in 1987 when Shelby was a Democrat.
Unlike fellow Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions, Shelby has not endorsed Trump.
Two House GOP members could face challenges tonight -- Reps. Martha Roby and Bradley Byrne.
At least one of the races not going to a runoff would be a surprise.
In 2014, Texas GOP Rep. Ralph Hall, then the oldest member of Congress, was forced into a runoff by John Ratcliffe, who eventually defeated Hall.
Runoff elections are frequently more challenging to incumbents because the challengers’ supporters are more energized and go to the polls."

Clinton and Trump are looking like the big winners according to most recent polls.
The way the GOP structured the primaries this season are working towards a quick nomination for Donald Trump. The new system was designed to make up for perceived flaws during the Romney nomination in 2012, but it’s front-weighting the nomination battle and that is helping Donald Trump. Nearly half the delegates for the nomination are at stake today.
Some in the GOP are saying they will not support Trump if he gets the nomination.
Reid Epstein in the Wall Street Journal today writes:
“A divisive battle is brewing in the Republican Party over the potential nomination of Donald Trump, as some party leaders warn they won't back him and could support third-party or write-in candidates.
Most party leaders still say they will back the party's nominee, and until recent days even Mr. Trump's loudest critics maintained they would back him in the general election if he wins the nomination.
That is beginning to change -- even as Mr. Trump is poised to win a string of Super Tuesday contests, and likely take the lion's share of the 595 delegates up for grabs today.”
Meantime, Hillary Clinton is already looking past Bernie Sanders to a likely battle with Donald Trump in the general election.
The Washington Post reporters Anne Gearan and Abby Phillip write today:
“Hillary Clinton and her allies are shifting their attention to a likely general-election contest against Donald Trump that they expect to be strongly negative - and for which they are planning an intensive effort to draw out minority voters who feel demonized by the billionaire real estate mogul. Clinton is still waging a hard-fought nomination battle against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont - including 11 contests on Tuesday - and some Democrats supporting her are wary of looking too far over the horizon. But increasingly sure that Trump will win the Republican nomination, Clinton appears this week to be running a two-pronged campaign against both Sanders and an eventual Republican opponent who sounds a lot like Trump.”
The WSJ reports that as many as 40% of the votes in some Super Tuesday states were already cast.. before polls even open.
The final batch of Hillary Clinton emails were released by the State Department.

Super Tuesday exit polls show divide among primary voters,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/WJqB0wEPq8Y/super-tuesday-exit-polls-show-divide-among-primary-voters.html,fox,3/1/2016 22:55:00,,"Early Super Tuesday exit polls are reflecting deep voter discontent across the country, with many saying they’re looking to an outsider to be the next president – though some are still uncomfortable with the idea of an outsider like Donald Trump claiming the Republican nomination.
The divide among GOP voters could be seen in several of the dozen states where polls are set to start closing soon.
In Georgia, Virginia and Massachusetts, early exit polls showed 50 percent or more of Republicans surveyed said they want an outsider.
That would appear a positive sign for a candidate like Trump. But in Georgia, 46 percent said they’d be dissatisfied if he were the nominee; in Virginia, that number was 52 percent.
Meanwhile, late-deciders in several states appeared to be breaking for Marco Rubio, including in Virginia, Georgia and Oklahoma. But Ted Cruz was getting the lion’s share of support from voters looking for someone “very conservative.”
With polls set to close soon, primary front-runners Hillary Clinton and Trump are aiming to rack up a daunting delegate lead and pull far away from their rivals in the nomination race.
The stakes are high.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates are up for grabs – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination.
And on the Democratic side, Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are battling for 865 delegates in 11 states – roughly a third of the number needed to clinch the nomination.
Clinton entered Super Tuesday with a head of steam following her landslide win over Sanders in South Carolina this past Saturday. She hopes her “firewall” of black voters holds up in several delegate-rich Southern states Tuesday, as she moves to sideline the still-popular Sanders from the race.
Barring a seismic shift in voter sentiment, Trump also is expected to dominate the Republican primary field Tuesday, adding to his already-sizable delegate lead – but Rubio and Cruz are battling fiercely for second, hoping to be the definitive alternative to take on Trump in what could be a bruising, to-the-convention fight for the future of the party.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who's expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
“Super Tuesday was never anything that we ever thought was going to be some great thing for us,” Kasich openly acknowledged to XXX earlier Tuesday.
Cruz is the odds-on favorite in his home state of Texas – which, with 155 delegates, is the biggest prize of the night. In a sign of his expectations, Cruz planned his election night party in Stafford, Texas.
But because delegates can be allocated proportionally in the Super Tuesday contests, Rubio and Cruz both want to rack up a substantial number of second-place finishes.
A Rubio campaign aide told XXX they are ""focused on only one thing today: delegates.""
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, but the senator vowed to go to all 50 states in a bid to thwart his presidential run.
In the run-up to Tuesday, Cruz and Rubio both have stepped up their attacks on the front-runner, resorting to the kinds of personal insults and attacks that have defined Trump’s campaign style.
Rubio defended the new tack in an interview with XXX.
“Every now and then, someone like that needs a taste of their own medicine because that's called a bully and he’s using the pulpit of the presidency or the presidential run to insult people,” Rubio said.
Cruz told XXX that while Trump will have a “big chunk of delegates” come Wednesday morning, “We're going to have a big chunk of delegates, and there's going to be a huge drop off for everybody else.”
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, has defended his continued presence in the race.
“People have asked for somebody who is not a politician, who was a member of we the people, who has an outstanding life of achievement and who thinks the way they do,” he told XXX."
SUPER TUESDAY OPINION  Clinton holds mathematical advantage over Sanders,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/03/01/hillary-vs-bernie-it-s-time-to-do-math-in-post-super-tuesday-world.html,fox,3/2/2016 5:06:06,,"Saturday night’s results in South Carolina were the start of something special for Hillary Clinton.
After a close to 50-point victory there where she garnered the support of over 80 percent of African-American voters, Clinton showed that her tough time in Iowa – where she won by less than half a percentage point – and New Hampshire where Sanders won by over 20 points, are a vague and distant memory.
How distant that memory is was clear Tuesday evening where Clinton won Super Tuesday handedly.  
Sanders had been running ahead in his home state of Vermont throughout the last two months and his big win there is no surprise. He also won Oklahoma and Colorado. He had also been hoping to make a play for Massachusetts.
So what does this mean for the future of the Democratic race?
Not a whole lot in terms of what you’re going to see in the day to day.
Bernie Sanders has made it clear that he will keep going until the convention this summer. He certainly has the money to make good on this promise – Sanders raised an astounding $43 million in February alone – and I have no doubt that he’ll continue raising funds at this level. Like Trump, Sanders has been successfully tapping into voter dissatisfaction and his populist message of addressing income inequality and reining in Wall Street has been deeply resonating with voters.
This isn’t apt to change and the media will continue to report that the momentum is on Sanders’s side as he draws huge crowds and raises millions.
It’s extremely unlikely that Clinton will start winning the youth vote back from him and she will instead focus on keeping the female vote and maintaining her support with the African- American community.
By the looks of it, and the turnout patterns we’ve seen thus far, this is going to be enough for Clinton to continue to on her path to the nomination. And much of this really comes down to the math.
To this end, when Sanders declared Tuesday evening that the contest has only begun because we still have 35 states left to vote, he’s not telling the whole story.
Clinton is amassing a big delegate lead and we know that she’s already far ahead with the Democrat superdelegates where she has the support of over 60 percent of them.
Sanders’s team knows what a tremendous advantage this is for Clinton as they’ve been reportedly trying to persuade superdelegates to reserve judgment until the popular vote totals are in. (This hasn’t been a particularly effective approach thus far).
It follows that, although it isn’t the glitziest way to win an election, Clinton is making it mathematically impossible for Sanders to win the nomination.
The #FeelTheBern movement was a powerful one, but it doesn’t look like it can go all the way."
"SUPER TUESDAY PRIZES Candidates in fierce fight for Texas, Mass. and Va.",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/29/super-tuesday-prizes-candidates-in-fierce-fight-for-texas-other-delegate-goldmines.html,fox,3/1/2016 2:08:05,,"The Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are charging into Super Tuesday in a coast-to-coast battle for delegates across a dozen states -- but while they're looking for as many wins as possible, a few select states stand out as the crown jewels. 
At the top of that list, in both primary contests, is Texas. The Lone Star State has the biggest cache -- 222 Democratic delegates and 155 for Republicans.  
And perhaps no candidate is fighting harder for that prize than Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The senator went all out on Monday, holding rallies in voter-rich Dallas, Houston and San Antonio in hopes of at least defeating national front-runner Donald Trump in Cruz's home state. 
“We are going to have a very good Super Tuesday,” Cruz assured the Dallas crowd. Cruz has maintained a polling lead in the state, but knows a surprise loss there could doom his campaign.  
For Republicans, the second-biggest prize is Georgia, with 76 delegates at stake. Both Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio put in face time with voters Monday in the final hours before polls open, while Cruz stayed rooted in Texas.  
On the Democratic side, too, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have focused their efforts. 
While Clinton declared Saturday night after her decisive win in the South Carolina primary that the campaign was going “national,” the former secretary of state was concentrating Monday on two delegate-heavy states -- the Democratic-stronghold of Massachusetts (91 delegates) and Virginia (95 delegates).
Solid wins there and beyond on Super Tuesday could give her a nearly insurmountable delegate count toward the nomination. 
Clinton to date leads Sanders in the delegate count 543-to-85, including so-called superdelegates. They will compete for 865 delegates on Tuesday and a total of roughly 1,800 delegates over the next two weeks, with 2,382 needed to win the nomination. 
The delegates on the line in a dozen states Tuesday represent a third of those needed to clinch the party nod. 
And on the GOP side, 595 delegates are on the line Tuesday across 11 states -- nearly half the number needed to secure the nomination. 
Sanders is focusing on Minnesota and Colorado, progressive states where he hopes his message of social and economic equality will translate into votes.
“Americans don’t need crumbs, they need the whole loaf,” Sanders said at a rally in Minneapolis.
He is expected on Tuesday to win his home state of Vermont, which has 16 Democratic delegates. Minnesota is worth far more, with 77 delegates. 
Still, many of these contests divide delegates proportionally, and so Sanders is poised to walk away with some, even where he loses. His strategy appears to be to at least survive Tuesday, with hopes of a resurgence later this month in Maine and Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio.
On the Republican side, Trump has won three straight -- the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, and the Nevada Republican Caucus -- garnering 82 delegates.
Cruz kicked off the 2016 balloting by winning the Iowa Republican Caucus. He has 17 delegates, ahead of Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio with 16.
Though trailing in Texas, Trump holds big leads in other delegate-rich Super Tuesday states.
The billionaire businessman leads by double-digits in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia, according to RealClearPolitics poll averages. Rough 53 percent of the GOP’s 595 delegates on Tuesday are in those states.
Those polls were released before Trump over the weekend initially declined to disavow the backing of former KKK leader David Duke, which Rubio says makes him “unelectable.” 
Trump has since disavowed the support and blamed a supposedly faulty earpiece for his original handling of the question. 
The tough race is taking a toll on the candidates. Rubio, barnstorming the South to take hold of the GOP establishment mantle, temporarily lost his voice at a rally outside of Atlanta and needed South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has endorsed him, to take the microphone.
The two other GOP candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have six and four delegates, respectively."

Super Tuesday's over. Can Trump still be stopped? Yes. Here's how,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/CBY9UhUZspM/super-tuesdays-over-can-trump-still-be-stopped-yes-heres-how.html,fox,3/2/2016 5:00:00,,"FILE -- Sept. 9, 2015: Sen.

Like the Titanic’s architects realizing their fatal design flaw right around the first strains of “Nearer My God To Thee,” Republicans are waking up to the realization that their presidential primary scheme is more Frankenstein than Frank Gehry.
To protect an establishment frontrunner against an insurgent, the party frontloaded this year’s primaries and caucuses. Going into March, only 133 delegates had been allocated. Super Tuesday added another 595 delegates. By month’s end, 1,537 of 2,472 delegates will be gone.
The problem: no one figured that, for the first time in modern GOP history, the insurgent would wind up as the frontrunner.
Which leads to the second problem: Republicans looking to stop Donald Trump are running out of opportunities to derail him.
So far, 15 states have allocated delegates. By March 22, another 15 will have gone to the polls, leaving but 20 states between then and the first Tuesday in June (just 11 weeks) to change the GOP narrative.
Returning to the Titanic, let’s presume the Republican ship hasn’t taken on too much water and it’s still a viable contest.
How then to stop Trump?
My suggestion:
1. Keep The Field Populated. To the proposition that the only way to beat Trump is via a head-to-head contest: don’t buy the spin.
The latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Poll played out such scenarios involving Trump versus Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The results? Rubio lost by six points; Cruz, by 13.
Assuming Rubio soldiers on past the March 15 vote in Florida, he and Cruz need to strike an accord: they don’t attack each other; their super PACs stick it to Trump. And they draw straws to decide who has to call Jeb Bush to ask for his super PAC join in the Trump-bashing.
Syndicated columnist and XXX contributor Jonah Goldberg takes this unholy alliance a step further, suggesting a Rubio-Cruz ticket ala Reagan-Bush in 1980. I’m not sure it’s in Cruz’s DNA to be so magnanimous, since he leads Rubio in states won and delegates earned.
Trump may keep winning states moving forward, but from here on it’s a quantity-not-quality argument, with the goal being . . .
2. Keep Trump Under 50 percent. The number that matters most? It’s not states won, but the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination.
Of the 1,744 Republican delegates left on the board after Super Tuesday, 391 are in winner-take-all states. The two most important: Florida and Ohio, on March 15. Trump has to be stopped in one, if not both, to slow down the express (at present, he leads in both).
That leaves 1,353 delegates to be allocated either proportionally or by some hybrid scheme. Most crucial of all: states where a 50% majority winner earns all the delegates (Texas has such a system).
Before Super Tuesday, not counting South Carolina where Trump won all 50 delegates, he and Cruz-Rubio split almost equally divided 65 delegates (31 for Trump, 32 for the senators). If something similar occurs in the remaining proportional states, with Trump staying near his mid-30’s ceiling, there’s still a shot at wheeling and dealing in Cleveland.
But before we get there, we’ll have a few…
3. Showdown States. I mentioned Ohio and Florida as must-have’s for the anti-Trump forces. Here are three others to add to the list.
First up: Wisconsin’s April 5 primary, which comes after a two-week break in the action and where last week’s Marquette Law Poll has Trump up by 10.
As the state with the nation’s tenth largest Catholic population, it may be an opportune moment to revisit Trump’s rope-a-Pope. And don’t forget: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had some unkind words about The Donald as he ended his presidential bid.
After that: Indiana’s May 3 primary. The Hoosier State is home to America’s most prophetic county seat. By the first Tuesday in May, it’s an indication of which way the political class leans: Indiana Sen. Dan Coats is no fan; Gov. Mike Pence, who’s up for reelection this fall, hasn’t endorsed.
Finally: if there’s still a race, California and New Jersey on June 7 – again, after a two-week intermission. Establishment Republicans would love nothing more than embarrassing New Jersey Gov. Christie on his home turf. But it’s a winner-take-all state in Trump’s backyard (51 delegates). A more pragmatic strategy would be to go to California and take advantage of a system that awards delegates three apiece for each of the state’s 53 congressional districts.
And from there . . .
4. Outmaneuver Trump Now, Outwit Him Later In Cleveland. Let’s suppose Trump goes to Cleveland close to but shy of a guaranteed first-ballot victory (the GOP’s last multi-ballot convention: 1948).
If no one is elected on the first ballot, all 2,472 delegates can vote for whomever’s name had been placed in nomination. Which means: to outwit Trump in Cleveland, stack the deck with delegates willing to bail on Trump once their commitment is over.
The GOP’s 437 “pledged” delegates (269 Republican officeholders past and present, plus 168 members of the Republican National Committee) would be lowest hanging of anti-Trump fruit. From there, Cruz and Rubio delegates will have to unite.
If the GOP is serious about stopping the insurrection, it intervenes at the grassroots level and shops for voters not only willing to become delegates, but open to the idea of switching candidates at the convention, the political equivalent of changing horses midstream.
Can Trump still be stopped? Yes. But it requires a lot of odd-shaped pieces to fall in place.
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to sink into a leather chair and enjoy a cigar and brandy – while the violins play and the lifeboats are lowered.
Just in case the unsinkable doesn’t happen."
The distraction at Trump Doral is whether the PGA Tour stays,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/ffc9NmGi6b8/distraction-at-trump-doral-is-whether-pga-tour-stays.html,fox,3/1/2016 16:46:41,,"Donald Trump was a distraction at golf tournaments even before he was running for president.
Go back 15 years when the LPGA Tour's final event was held at Trump International in West Palm Beach. It was bad enough that Trump walked down the middle of the fairways as if he owned the place (which he did). In the second round, Karrie Webb hit a tee shot on the par-3 seventh that was short of the green and tumbling toward the water when light rough held it up.
Trump, who thinks golf isn't great unless it's hard, said that while Webb was a great player, that shot should have gone in the water. That night, his maintenance staff shaved the banks so severely that green spray paint was used to cover a few splotches of bare dirt.
Two years ago at Doral, Rory McIlroy hit 4-iron into the par-3 ninth during a practice round when he was asked to hold his position. Turns out The Donald was ready to leave, and his helicopter was parked near the walkway toward the green. McIlroy could only smile amid the roar of rotors and gusts as the helicopter took off.
At least it was a practice round. Trump caused an even bigger stir when his helicopter had players backing off shots at Turnberry in the first round of the Women's British Open last year.
Is he bad for golf?
Not at all.
But he might turn out to be bad for Doral, which has been part of the Florida swing longer than other PGA Tour event.
Trump has been scooping up properties from Scotland to Dubai, from Los Angeles to New York and Florida, for more than a decade. They are good courses, enough that majors from three tours will be held on them over the next six years — the 2017 U.S. Women's Open and 2022 PGA Championship at Trump National in Bedminster, New Jersey, and the 2017 Senior PGA Championship at Trump National in Potomac Falls, Virginia.
Whether those championship will be played at his courses is still to be determined. The PGA of America last year canceled its Grand Slam of Golf at Trump's course in Los Angeles shortly after his comments about Mexican immigrants when Trump announced his candidacy.
The other golf organizations tried their best to say as little as possible, waiting to see how his bid for the GOP nomination would play out. Odds are none of them saw Trump winning primaries, leading in the polls and gaining momentum going into Super Tuesday.
What now?
Of immediate concern is the World Golf Championship at Doral this week. The helipad was vacant on Tuesday and likely will remain that way for most of the week, although PGA Tour officials have been told that Trump is likely to make an appearance at some point, most likely Sunday.
This is the first time the top three players in the world — Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and McIlroy — have competed in the same event since September. That won't create a fraction of the buzz as when The Donald drops in.
That's not the problem, however.
Doral has been a popular part of the PGA Tour since 1962, and this could very well be the last one.
No one saw this coming in 2012 when Trump added Florida's most famous golf resort to his portfolio. He poured $250 million into the resort and had Gil Hanse redo the Blue Monster to make it more dramatic by bringing water into play more than it already was. It also has become too great an advantage for the long hitters, perhaps more than any other course on tour. Look at the top six from last year — Dustin Johnson, J.B. Holmes, Bubba Watson, Adam Scott, Henrik Stenson and Louis Oosthuizen.
Not everyone loves the redesign. That's nothing new, and it's not the issue.
It's Trump as a presidential candidate, and the bombastic dialogue that has become a staple of his campaign, which makes the future in Miami look bleak.
The PGA Tour has a contract with Doral through 2023, although there is a provision that a new title sponsor would have the right to take the tournament somewhere else. Cadillac is in the final year of its title sponsorship and is not going to renew.
The task is to find a new sponsor that doesn't mind the sideshow that Trump brings to a tournament.
If a new sponsor doesn't want to be at Trump Doral, there are not many other options in Miami with the property that can handle size of a World Golf Championship.

They are still unable to come to terms with Donald Trump's massive appeal.
Still unwilling to acknowledge that Ted Cruz is actually a viable candidate for the White House.

They still just can't seem to understand why American voters will not do their bidding and support Marco Rubio.
There’s plenty of book smarts among that crowd -- but no street smarts.
So let me explain what this election is all about.
It's about the hundreds of Indiana workers who just found out their jobs are heading to Mexico.
It's about the Disney employees who were fired -- and then forced to train their foreign replacements.
It's about a systematic invasion of our nation by illegal aliens -- while our government turns a blind eye.
It's about people like Kate Steinle -- murdered on American soil -- by an illegal immigrant.
It's about a war on religious liberty -- and our right to bear arms.
It's about a feckless government that refuses to acknowledge we are at war with radical Islam.
For the past eight years -- we have been told that America is no longer an exceptional nation -- that we are responsible for global chaos.
That Old Glory is a sign of racism and xenophobia.
The American people are fed up. And now we're serving notice on both parties: We are beholden to no one -- Republican or Democrat -- and if we have to burn down the village to save village -- then burn, baby, burn.
That's what this election is all about."
Trump builds delegate lead – but it's no lock,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/Q57mTwsTPGY/trump-builds-delegate-lead-but-its-no-lock.html,fox,3/2/2016 18:47:00,,"Donald Trump’s seven Super Tuesday wins helped pad his substantial delegate lead – but not enough to dispirit his top rivals, who still see a path to toppling the Republican front-runner and taking the fight to the convention if necessary.  
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, at the very least, seem determined to compete for every vote through the March 15 contests, which could make for the most consequential night of the GOP campaign.
That’s when the home states of Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich vote. And both states award every delegate on the table to the winner.
“If I win Florida, what does that math look like?” Rubio told XXX on Wednesday, brushing aside pressure to drop out.
Here’s where the delegate math stands now:
It takes 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination. Trump has 319; Cruz has 226; and Rubio has 110.
According to Associated Press estimates, Trump needs to lock down 52 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the party nod.
March 15 may provide the best clue as to whether that’s likely.
On one hand, if Rubio were to win Florida and Kasich were to win Ohio, they would continue to hold down Trump’s numbers even if he wins elsewhere.
On the other, a Trump victory in those states and beyond would truly give him an aura of inevitability – not to mention put immense pressure on Rubio and Kasich to drop out.
Rubio already is facing that pressure from Trump and Cruz, who wants non-Trump voters to unite behind his campaign, which he claims is the only one that can confront and defeat the billionaire businessman.
DELEGATES: WHERE DO CANDIDATES STAND NOW? | InsideGov
“So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation,"" he said Tuesday night. ""And, after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
Cruz and the rest of the candidates will have their next chance to make their case to the American public on Thursday, when they face off for a Fox News debate in Detroit, their first post-Super Tuesday showdown. 
One candidate has already bowed out of the event, Ben Carson -- who, after a disappointing Super Tuesday, announced he sees no ""political path forward,"" while stopping just short of suspending his campaign. The debate Thursday could see Rubio and Cruz ratchet up their fight for the not-Trump mantle, with Rubio clearly lagging right now in the race for second.  
Cruz won in his delegate-rich home state of Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska on Tuesday. Together with his leadoff win in the Iowa caucuses, Cruz has claimed wins in four states.
Rubio, who has seen GOP establishment figures line up behind his campaign especially since Jeb Bush dropped out, has struggled to account for his performance to date.
The senator did claim his first win Tuesday night in Minnesota. And – while touting the fact he’s picked up delegates even in states he didn’t win – he implicitly questioned Cruz’s ability to win in some of the upcoming contests, claiming several states coming up “look more like Virginia” where Rubio beat Cruz in the race for second Tuesday.
He’s referring to states like Illinois and even Michigan, with a more moderate primary electorate.
But Deep South states like Mississippi and Louisiana also are fast-approaching on the calendar.
“There are some states that are going to be favorable to [Cruz],” Cruz supporter and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told XXX. While a voting bloc thought to be Cruz’s strong suit – evangelicals – are still breaking for Trump in some Southern states, Abbott suggested those voters will start shifting soon to Cruz.
One scenario is for Rubio and Cruz to stay in the race if only to prevent Trump from achieving the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
Asked about that possibility, Rubio told XXX “we’re going to do whatever it takes” to prevent the nomination from falling into Trump’s hands – but said the plan is to clinch the nomination, not simply prevent Trump from doing so.
Rubio is putting it all on the line in Florida, meanwhile, vowing Wednesday that he’ll win.
Trump is threatening to crush those hopes, and cites polls that show him well ahead of Rubio.
“We're going to go to Florida. We're going to spend so much time in Florida. We've got about a 20-point lead,” Trump said Tuesday night, at a post-primary press conference in the Sunshine State.
Trump already is positioning himself as a general election candidate, increasingly taking swings at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who also had a good night on Tuesday with seven wins to Bernie Sanders’ four.
But he allowed, with the GOP race still open, that another candidate might also be able to take her on – taking another swipe at Rubio in the process.
“I don't think Marco is going to be able to beat her. …  I think Ted's going to have a very hard time. But Ted at least has a shot because at least he's won a little bit,” Trump said."
"Trump, Clinton Dominate Super Tuesday",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/gHP4s9lqxgM/trump-clinton-dominate-super-tuesday.html,fox,3/2/2016 14:38:00,,"Super Tuesday wasn’t a clean sweep, but it was a good night for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton won Texas, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Arkansas. Bernie Sanders won Vermont, Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma.
It wasn’t a terrible night for Bernie Sanders, but Clinton’s delegate lead now seems to put the nomination out of reach for the Vermont Democratic Socialist. Indeed, Hillary Clinton appears to be moving on to argue her case against Donald Trump.
Here’s how John Wagner put it in today’s Washington Post, “The senator from Vermont walked away with four victories to Hillary Clinton's seven, and most of hers were more decisive. She finished the evening with a significantly larger lead in the delegate count than when it started. With Tuesday's results, Sanders risked reverting to his original role as a message candidate, influencing the conversation with his relentless focus on income inequality but holding little hope of becoming the Democratic nominee for president.”
Donald Trump won seven states: Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia and Georgia.
Ted Cruz won Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska. Marco Rubio won Minnesota.
Unfortunately for GOP unity, no one is dropping out and it appears it will be a long fight.
Dan Balz writes in the Washington Post today,
“The window for stopping Donald Trump closed almost completely Tuesday night, leaving the demoralized anti-Trump forces with two weeks and no agreed-upon strategy for denying the New York billionaire the Republican presidential nomination.
Trump was on his way to a series of victories in a majority of the 11 contests that made up the biggest single primary-caucus night of the nominating season. His remaining rivals - Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Gov. John Kasich - and their allies were left to cling to the flimsiest of hopes that a reversal of his fortunes still lies on the near horizon.
For Rubio, the hope of many in the establishment, Super Tuesday turned into a super disappointment. He made a run at Trump in Virginia but fell short. Late Tuesday, he was declared the winner in the Minnesota caucuses. Still, that left his win-loss record this year at 1-14. Meanwhile, he was running third in at least half the states, and in some of those states his percentage of the vote was low enough that he was in danger of winning few or no delegates.”
 
But it wasn’t all good news for Mister Trump, Robert Costa and Philip Rucker write today in the Washington Post “Tuesday's results exposed some vulnerabilities for Trump: He lost late deciding voters in many states by wide margins to rival Marco Rubio, a sign that the senator from Florida may have had some impact with his withering assault on Trump's character. Ohio Gov. John Kasich also came close to beating Trump in Vermont.”
Patrick O'Connor and Janet Hook write in today’s Wall Street Journal,
“New York businessman Donald Trump won Republican primaries Tuesday from the Deep South to New England, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took his home state and Oklahoma, ensuring that the race for the GOP nomination will stretch into the spring.
The Republican front-runner won contests in at least seven states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia -- bolstering his claim on the nomination. Still, the pockets of resistance in others gave a glimmer of hope to detractors desperate for another candidate to take on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who also rolled to a series of victories on Super Tuesday.
The problem for Mr. Trump's rivals -- as it has been since the voting began -- is that there are too many of them for voters to coalesce behind a single alternative to the New York billionaire. In the past week, opponents have dramatically intensified their attacks on Mr. Trump after he steamrolled rivals in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.”
Here’s a couple of other headlines I found intriguing about the race so far:
Politico says “Hillary Clinton is pushing Sanders to the brink.”
The New York Times says “Donald Trump rolls on in a race that could drag on.”
Washington Post says “Trump owns Super Tuesday but Cruz and Rubio see glimmers of hope.”
Political Wire says “Ted’s not Dead Yet”, and “Rubio left gasping after Super Tuesday.”

Ted Cruz, with victories in delegate-rich Texas and in Oklahoma, is far from conceding anything.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, too, found reason to press on, with Super Tuesday wins in Minnesota, Oklahoma, Colorado and his home state of Vermont. Even Marco Rubio, after a string of second- and third-place finishes, found his first win in Minnesota.
But with Clinton amassing a huge delegate lead, the more competitive race is on the Republican side – where Cruz clearly edged Rubio in the Super Tuesday battle for second and quickly positioned himself as the better candidate to take on Trump.
“Tonight was another decision point, and the voters have spoken,” Cruz said in Texas, urging voters to unite behind him so he could take on Trump “head to head.” 
Even with the senators' victories, Trump emerged from Tuesday’s contests closer than ever to the nomination, and acting more and more like a general election candidate eager to take on Democratic front-runner Clinton.
“Once we get all of this finished, I’m going to go after one person, and that’s Hillary Clinton,” he said, at an unusual primary night press conference in Florida. “I think that’s frankly going to be an easy race.”
Speaking in Florida after notching several wins, Clinton also seemed to look beyond Sanders – taking implicit shots at Trump’s “make America great again” campaign slogan.
“America never stopped being great,” Clinton said. “We have to make America whole.”
She also mocked his proposal for a southern border wall, saying, “Instead of building walls, we’re going to break down barriers.” 
Trump answered right back, quipping: ""Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again."" 
With results still coming in, Trump is projected to win in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. Clinton is projected to win Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates were up for grabs Tuesday – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination. And on the Democratic side, Clinton and Vermont Sen. Sanders were battling for 865 delegates in 11 states – roughly a third of the number needed to clinch the nomination.
No matter how the delegate math shakes out, the primary races are not over – yet.
While the Super Tuesday contests marked the biggest day of primary season voting to date, the states were mostly allocating delegates proportionally, meaning even the runner-ups could add to their totals.
Rubio stressed that point, as he began to focus on the March 15 contest in his home state.
“We never said Super Tuesday was going to be our night,” he told XXX.
Cruz clearly had the better night.
Texas was the biggest prize on the Super Tuesday map, offering 222 Democratic delegates and 155 Republican delegates. A win for Cruz in his home state was considered critical, and he was able to thwart any potential late-hour surge by Trump there.
While Cruz put subtle pressure on Rubio to step aside, Trump openly mocked the Florida senator after earlier calling on him to drop out – a call Rubio rebuffed. Trump again called him a ""lightweight"" while threatening to take on the Florida senator in his home state in two weeks. 
Clinton entered Super Tuesday with a head of steam following her landslide win over Sanders in South Carolina this past Saturday.
Sanders, though, savored his home-state win all the same, rallying cheering supporters in Vermont Tuesday evening. 
""It is good to be home,"" he said, before shifting to his stump speech slams against a ""corrupt campaign finance system."" 
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the GOP race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton racked up a string of Super Tuesday primary victories, pulling well ahead of their rivals in the race for delegates – though their closest competitors, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Bernie Sanders, notched enough wins or close seconds to keep the race alive.

Cruz, though, is projected to win the Republican primary in his home state of Texas, as well as in Oklahoma.

Texas was the biggest prize on the Super Tuesday map, offering 222 Democratic delegates and 155 Republican delegates. A win for Cruz was considered critical, and he was able to thwart any potential late-hour surge by Trump there.
Elsewhere, races remained too close to call, including in Vermont on the GOP side, where John Kasich, who campaigned heavily there, is surprisingly competitive with Trump. 
Trump and Rubio had been in a battle for first in Virginia, but Rubio is now projected to finish a close second. 
Trump, holding an unusual primary-night press conference in Florida, repeatedly taunted Rubio for his Super Tuesday finish -- again calling him a ""lightweight"" while threatening to take on the Florida senator in his home state on March 15.

While Trump was expected to dominate the Republican primary field, Rubio and Cruz were battling fiercely for second -- hoping to be the definitive alternative to take on Trump in what could be a bruising, to-the-convention fight for the future of the party.
Ohio Gov. Kasich, who's expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
“Super Tuesday was never anything that we ever thought was going to be some great thing for us,” Kasich openly acknowledged to XXX earlier Tuesday.
In a sign of his expectations, Cruz planned his election night party in Stafford, Texas.
But because delegates can be allocated proportionally in the Super Tuesday contests, Rubio and Cruz both want to rack up a substantial number of second-place finishes.
A Rubio campaign aide told XXX they are ""focused on only one thing today: delegates.""
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, but the senator vowed to go to all 50 states in a bid to thwart his presidential run.
In the run-up to Tuesday, Cruz and Rubio both have stepped up their attacks on the front-runner, resorting to the kinds of personal insults and attacks that have defined Trump’s campaign style.
Rubio defended the new tack in an interview with XXX.
“Every now and then, someone like that needs a taste of their own medicine because that's called a bully and he’s using the pulpit of the presidency or the presidential run to insult people,” Rubio said.
Cruz told XXX that while Trump will have a “big chunk of delegates” come Wednesday morning, “We're going to have a big chunk of delegates, and there's going to be a huge drop off for everybody else.”
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, has defended his continued presence in the race.

Ted Cruz jointly turned up the pressure on Marco Rubio to drop out -- though the Florida senator insists he remains a contender and is ""optimistic"" about turning the race around once his home state votes.
Trump won seven states in Tuesday’s contests, bringing his delegate count to 316. Cruz, who won three states, now has 226 delegates. Rubio, with one state win and some second- and third-place finishes, brings his tally to 106. 
For Rubio, he's eyeing the March 15 primary in his home state of Florida as the game-changer. 
But at least until then, Trump and Cruz are working to sideline him.

Trump, who has openly mocked Rubio for everything from excessive sweating to drinking water on camera, vowed to beat the senator in his home state. 
With 10 furled American flags and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie standing behind him, Trump poked fun at Rubio, referring to him as “the little senator” and “a lightweight.” 
""It was a very tough night for Marco Rubio,"" Trump said. 
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, while stopping just short of repeating the call at his press conference. But he said, ""You've got to be able to win something.""

Rubio, who has repeatedly called Trump a “con artist” and slammed Cruz for not performing better on Super Tuesday, told XXX he’s not going anywhere.  
“Sixty-five percent of the people who voted yesterday across Super Tuesday did not vote for Donald Trump,” Rubio said. “He underperformed in virtually every state of the map.”
Rubio also had sharp words for Cruz.
“Let’s not forget that last night was supposed to be Ted Cruz’s big night. It was the night where he was going to sweep. The states were tailor made for the kind of campaign he was running. We beat him in Georgia. We beat him in half the states on the map.”
Rubio said the delegate counts will level out in upcoming winner-take-all primaries.  Rubio said he expects to win all of Florida’s 99 delegates up for grabs in the March 15 primary.
