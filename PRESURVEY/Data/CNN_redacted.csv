6 takeaways from Super Tuesday,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/super-tuesday-results-recap/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 6:06:47,,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton didn't win their parties' nominations on Super Tuesday -- but they both became much harder to beat. 
Trump racked up wins in seven states to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's two and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's one. And Clinton defeated Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in seven of the 11 Democratic contests.  
Here are six takeaways from the biggest day in the 2016 presidential race so far: 

He proved it in the early states and now he has proven it on Super Tuesday: Donald Trump is leading a coalition.  
New Hampshire and Massachusetts showed he wins white, working-class moderates -- the Reagan Democrats. South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia showed he wins evangelicals in the Bible Belt. And record-shattering Republican turnout in Virginia showed he expands the party's base of voters.  
""I'm a unifier â€” I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me,"" Trump said. 
Trump is running away with the GOP nomination, as his rivals continue their never-ending fight about who's the best alternative. 
He survived the latest controversy, this one over whether he'd given a subtle wink to white supremacists by deflecting questions about whether he'd disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke in an interview with XXX's Jake Tapper.  
And he bested two opponents who'd devoted an entire two-hour debate Thursday night to dumping their opposition research books on his head.  
After an introduction by former rival and new campaign surrogate New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Trump congratulated Cruz on an ""excellent win"" in Texas before turning his attention to Hillary Clinton. 
""Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again,"" he said, referencing her new attack line.

It's the polar opposite of where Clinton found herself eight years ago. This time, she's ahead in the delegate race and has won a majority of the Democratic contests.  
Clinton won a swath of delegate-rich Southern states with large minority populations, easily besting Sanders in Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas. And she won the night's biggest toss-up, narrowly defeating Sanders in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts win, in particular, showed that it's not just a minority firewall for Clinton -- she can win states that are predominantly white. 
The Democratic nominating contest allocates delegates proportionally, so Clinton hasn't knocked Sanders out of the race.  
But she has a date in mind to do just that: March 15.  
With all of the momentum, Clinton is aiming for wins in a series of big states -- Michigan on March 8 and then Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri on March 15.  
At that point, the scenarios for a Sanders comeback become ""less and less likely,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said -- even though the campaign expects to lose in Kansas, Nebraska and Maine between now and then.

Cruz did exactly what he needed to do: He won his home state of Texas by a resounding margin, and he tacked on Oklahoma -- allowing him to continue his argument that he is the only Republican who can beat Trump.  
In fact, Cruz called on the rest of the GOP field to ""prayerfully"" consider dropping out of the race during his election-night speech.  
""Tonight, this campaign enters a new phase,"" Cruz said. ""Tomorrow morning we have a choice. So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely, and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives and for the nation. And after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
Cruz's comments came before the results were finalized in Minnesota, Rubio's best state.  
And he ignored the reality that there are no real signs the Republican establishment likes him any more than Trump.  
But in the GOP primary right now, when Cruz or Rubio rises, the other falls -- and Cruz had the better night Tuesday.  
On the other hand: Cruz had pegged his entire campaign to Super Tuesday, calling it the most important date in the race. He once used the word ""firewall"" to describe it -- a fact Rubio's campaign has gleefully trumpeted. Yet he only won two states, and many of the Southern states he banked on previously have now already voted.

Rubio has defended his string of second and third-place finishes by arguing he has a path to victory that focuses on the post-Super Tuesday states, including his native Florida. 
He finally got on the board Tuesday, winning the Minnesota caucuses. 
But overall, the night was another disappointment for Rubio, who spent much of the past week unleashing a barrage of Trump-like attacks against the billionaire businessman. 
Now, Rubio has to explain, again, to donors and power brokers why he's worth a major investment. His argument: The race now goes to Michigan, and then five bigger states with more moderate, suburban, highly educated Republicans -- places he can win. Florida is one of them, and it's winner-take-all.  
""That's where we're really going to catch fire,"" Rubio told XXX's Jake Tapper in a Tuesday night interview.  
Trump and Cruz, meanwhile, are happy to tell Rubio that he's finished. 
""He had a tough night. He is a lightweight,"" Trump said.  
And he's ready to put Rubio away, saying, ""We're gonna spend a lot of time in Florida.""

The Democratic night largely followed expectations, with Sanders picking up wins in Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Vermont.  
The only other state where he stood a real chance was Massachusetts, a liberal stronghold bordering his native Vermont. But he was unable to win there, or dent Clinton's momentum elsewhere on the map. 
Speaking early in the night, Sanders made the argument that he's racking up nearly as many delegates as Clinton -- so there's no reason for him to consider looking for the exits any time soon.  
""This is not a general election; it's not winner-take-all,"" Sanders told his adoring crowd. ""If you get 52%, you get 48%, you roughly end up with the same amount of delegates in a state. By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates."" 
There's no reason Sanders can't stay competitive: He raised $42 million in February alone, giving him plenty of cash to match or outspend Clinton on the airwaves.  
Sanders has another particularly useful tool in his pocket: More Democratic debates, starting Sunday night in Flint, Michigan.  
Clinton agreed to them as Sanders was gaining momentum nationally. Now, though, they serve to extend the life of a race that Clinton's campaign would prefer to bring to an effective end as soon as possible.  
Michigan votes next Tuesday -- and it'll be a precursor for the following week's Ohio primary. Those now look like states Sanders needs to win.  

There's a reason John Kasich is facing calls from Republicans to get out of the race: he's a spoiler to candidates trying to topple Trump.
In Virginia, for instance, Kasich took 9.4%, and Rubio lost to Trump by 2.8%.  
""We basically fought Donald Trump to a draw. And had it been a narrower field, we would have won Virginia,"" Rubio said on XXX Tuesday night.
Expect a chorus of party brass to press Kasich to depart before Ohio's March 15 winner-take-all primary. If Rubio could win both Florida and Ohio on that day, he'd gain 165 delegates in one fell swoop.  
But with Kasich in the race, that won't happen.  
Kasich isn't inclined to help Rubio. His campaign argues that it's Rubio who is underperforming expectations -- spoiling, for example, what would've been a Kasich win in Vermont.  
Dr. Ben Carson, too, is refusing to exit the race -- and while he's hardly racking up any delegates, he's a thorn in the side of Cruz.
Carson performs best among evangelical voters. That's Cruz's strong suit, too. While it's not clear where Carson's support would go, Cruz could have figured to pick up the largest share of it -- giving him a boost in Southern states.

"After GOP establishment 'froze' on Trump, Democrats ready battle plans",http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-democrats-election-2016/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 4:20:46,,"As Donald Trump seems poised for a huge night Tuesday, Democrats see his stunning ascent and controversial, celebrity-driven business empire as a golden opportunity. 
""Those bankruptcies screwed a lot of people -- and not just hedge fund yuppies,"" said a top strategist aligned with a pro-Clinton super PAC. ""His idea of 'winning' has involved a lot of bad behavior -- and the victims are exactly the profile of Trump voters: blue-collar whites.""
For months, key campaign operatives inside the Republican Party establishment were supremely confident that Trump would implode long before this moment. Instead, the GOP is now facing an existential crisis not seen in more than a generation as much of the party leadership and many of its top figures are in open revolt against Trump's candidacy heading into Super Tuesday.
The potential liabilities lurking in Trump's background are hardly a secret. The real estate magnate's occasional business failings and colorful personal life have filled the pages of New York tabloids for decades.
Storing its ammunition for the general election, one pro-Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has taken a few jabs at Trump, choosing instead to portray the businessman as a reflection of the Republican Party.
""Trump is no fluke. Nor is he hijacking the Republican Party or the conservative movement,"" wrote Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky in an email to reporters. ""He is, rather, the party's creation, its Frankenstein monster.""
A Trump rival, Marco Rubio, has only recently decided to tap that treasure trove of opposition research. That offensive, however, only began in earnest at last week's Republican debate as Rubio mocked Trump's inheritance and legal troubles facing the real estate academy launched by his the tycoon's vast organization.
The Democrats' looming business boogeyman assault on Trump is nearly identical to the attack leveled at the last GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, whose financial firm Bain Capital was savaged by pro-Obama super PACs over its practice of downsizing manufacturers for profit.
Inside the pro-Clinton super PAC-world, the Republican establishment's miscalculation is viewed as a tactical error of epic proportions.
""Amazing. They just froze,"" the PAC aligned strategist said, requesting anonymity.
No candidacy better illustrates GOP's painful lesson, in the minds of several top GOP advisers, than that of Jeb Bush. 
As Trump delighted in pointing out at every one of his rallies, the former Florida governor and his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, both amassed a war chest capable of annihilating any potential rival. But instead of directing that arsenal at Trump, Bush and his allies chose to target fellow establishment figures, especially Rubio.
""The civilized world raised an army and entrusted it to Right to Rise PAC,"" said Stuart Stevens, Romney's former campaign manager. ""Instead of fighting barbarians, they decided to try and kill everybody who agrees with them. Crazy. Just crazy.""
""The Right to Rise thing is historically bad,"" he added.
Stevens, a key figure in Romney's political world, has brutally attacked the GOP front-runner on Twitter. 
""It's becoming obvious that supporting or not supporting (Trump) isn't a political choice. It's a moral choice. The man is evil,"" he said.
Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, brushed off the party's concerns about his candidate. 
""I worry about everything,"" Lewandowski quipped. 
Rubio's calculated, yet harsh attack on Trump came only hours after Romney challenged the billionaire businessman to release his tax returns. Trump responded with a slew of insults aimed at Romney on Friday, remarking that the former Massachusetts governor had no hopes of winning in 2012 because he ""walked like a duck.""
On Monday, Romney tweeted that Trump's inability to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan on XXX's ""State of the Union"" as disqualifying.
As for Bush, he was hardly the only candidate to engage in Trump denial. 
Ted Cruz, who has also raised a vast fortune in contributions, studiously avoided contact with the GOP front-runner for much of 2015, hopeful that Trump would self-destruct and releasing his angry anti-establishment electorate in search of safe harbor. 
The famously tough-talking Chris Christie grumbled to reporters time and again that he would not attack Trump, only doing so before dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor is now arguably Trump's most senior establishment supporter.
Also underestimated was the anger brewing on the margins of the American economic recovery. Working-class voters who are simply too conservative to support a self-declared democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders are flocking to Trump's message that illegal immigration and bad trade deals are decimating the heartland.
Trump has dubbed these boisterous followers, who stuff themselves into arenas and auditoriums, the ""noisy majority."" 
And while they may actually have the energy and enthusiasm to sweep Trump and the Republican Party back into the White House, many in the GOP hierarchy are predicting easy pickings for Democrats and associated super PACs come November.
Another top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, sees the rise of Trump as a logical extension of the tea party movement, which is highly capable of putting conservatives in Congress, but is a turnoff to more moderate, suburban voters in presidential elections. 
""This is the natural consequence of 2009 and 2010,"" said the strategist. ""We co-opted a movement made up largely of the least informed voters. We got significant short-term political gain, but in the process empowered a group that has little interest in reason.""
""We reap what we sow,"" the strategist said.
Trump is equally disdainful of his Republican critics. The celebrity magnate, who authored ""The Art of the Deal,"" routinely lambastes GOP leaders in Congress over the recent budget deal with the White House. Trump insists he will broker better agreements as president by simply walking away from the negotiating table when necessary.
At times, Trump has sought to ease tensions within the Republican Party over his superheated rhetoric on immigration. He often highlights his standing in the polls with Latino voters and praises the Hispanic employees who work at his hotels.
But senior GOP advisers privately worry the damage is done.
""The bubble will crash at some point, but I fear we will be tatters by the time it does,"" one top Republican congressional aide said.

Ben Carson skipping GOP debate,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/ben-carson-doesnt-see-a-political-path-forward-wont-go-to-debate/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 19:18:26,,"Ben Carson doesn't ""see a political path forward"" in the Republican presidential nomination process, and will not attend Thursday's GOP presidential debate in his hometown of Detroit, he said in a statement.
The retired neurosurgeon and his aides reached the decision after a staff meeting Wednesday morning in Baltimore after a disappointing finish on Super Tuesday.  
Carson said he's not planning on formally suspending his presidential campaign and will go into more detail during an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Committee Conference near Washington on Friday. 
But it appears to end what once seemed like a promising campaign for the first-time political candidate. He was the first GOP candidate to overtake Donald Trump in the polls for a period of several weeks around October 2015. But as fall turned to winter, Carson consistently lost ground to Trump and later Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
Republican operatives, looking to move Carson out of the race as they try to remove obstacles to finding a challenger to Donald Trump, were planning Wednesday to suggest he drop out and instead run for the U.S. Senate seat in Florida. He also suggested the five remaining candidates meet before the Detroit debate to try and work out their differences.
Carson never made a cogent argument for his candidacy, running mostly on his biography rather than policy and political views. Carson undisputedly had an impressive personal story to tell. He overcame a troubled youth in inner-city Detroit, becoming a star student and eventually a world-class neurosurgeon. He won international acclaim in the late 980s after successfully separating conjoined twins. 
In June 2008, President George W. Bush awarded Carson the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. ""For a time, young Ben Carson was headed down that same path,"" Bush said at the time. ""Yet through his reliance on faith and family, he turned his life into a sharply different direction.""  
But Carson's origin story took a hit after a XXX report raised questions about claims he made about violent episodes as a youth. Trump, rising in the polls, took to mocking Carson, particularly over a story from the surgeon's memoir about Carson attempting to stab a friend -- the knife broke in a half after hitting a large belt buckle.  
Carson's debate performances didn't help, either. He often seemed halting in his speech patterns in a forum that prizes quick and snappy soundbites. And his command of policy appeared shaky -- he asserted that the Chinese were in Syria, a claim the White House disputed. He repeatedly deflected questions on how to confront ISIS, among other foreign policy challenges. Even on health care, Carson's seeming specialty, he didn't have many specifics to offer beyond saying that Obamacare should be abolished.
Carson's campaign also suffered internal conflicts, with competing power centers often at odds. In the run-up to the Iowa caucuses, a contest that was crucial to his chances because of his connections with evangelicals, the tensions came to a head, with his top advisers leaving the campaign. Adding to the turmoil, Carson's former advisers were unusually public in their criticism of Carson as a candidate and of his campaign structure. 
R.I.P. religious right, and other Super Tuesday takeaways
When voting actually began, with the February 1 Iowa caucuses, Carson wasn't much of a factor except as a spoiler. He finished fourth at 9.3%. His New Hampshire primary showing was even worse. Carson finished eighth, with only 2.3% of the vote -- ahead only of candidates who had dropped out of the race but whose names remained on the ballot. Then in the February 20 South Carolina primary, Carson finished sixth, with less than 8% of the vote.

Clinton takes aim at Trump over KKK stumble,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-kkk/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 20:49:46,,"Hillary Clinton on Super Tuesday took aim at Donald Trump for not immediately repudiating former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. 
""I'm just speaking out against bigotry and bullying wherever I hear it. And I hear a lot of it from the Republican candidates. They seem to have forgotten completely about issues and they're now running their campaigns based on insults,"" Clinton said, taking questions from reporters. ""It's turned into a kind of one-upmanship on insulting and I don't think that's appropriate in a presidential campaign, and I'm going to speak up on it.""
The Democratic front-runner said that while Trump is doing well, she will ""wait and see who they nominate.""
But she also took aim at Trump for stumbling when asked Sunday by XXX's Jake Tapper to disavow support he has received from Duke, though he has since done so.
""I was very disappointed that he did not disavow what appears to be support from David Duke and the Klan,"" Clinton said. ""That is exactly the kind of statement that should be repudiated upon hearing it.""
Clinton wouldn't comment on what states she believes she will win on Tuesday and batted away a question about whether her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has a path to victory should he lose big.
""We are working hard everywhere,"" Clinton said, responding to questions from her traveling press corps for the first time in 88 days. ""All we can do is help people turn out for the primaries and the caucuses.""
The former secretary of state added that her campaign will wait to ""see what voters decide in all these states that are lined up today"" before they ""take stock"" of what it all means for Sanders' campaign. 
""But I'm going to keep going,"" Clinton said. ""I've got a lot of work to do next Tuesday and the Tuesday after that.""
Clinton's campaign is confident the former secretary of state will do well in states like Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia, all states she has visited in the last few days. They are anticipating Sanders will win Vermont, his home state, and see states like Minnesota, Oklahoma and Massachusetts as toss-ups.
Asked if she will ask Sanders to drop out should he have a bad night, Clinton said, ""Everybody has to make their own decisions.""
After a dominant win in South Carolina on Saturday, Clinton's campaign has been infused with increasing confidence.
Clinton's comments came at Mapps Coffee & Tea, a small coffee shop in Minneapolis. Supporters mingled with Clinton before she took questions from the media. 
Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, an early supporter, worked the shop with her.
After buying a coffee, Clinton was confronted by a young woman who identified herself as Somali-America and questioned Clinton's commitment to racial justice and past comments she has made. Clinton had a long conversation with the woman, explaining her views on race and noting the fact that her first speech as a candidate was on criminal justice reform.
The woman then questioned the authenticity of Somali-Americans who have endorsed Clinton's run for president.
""Why don't you go run for something then?"" Clinton said before the woman quickly left the shop.

Colorado Republicans aren't getting much of a say in 2016,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/colorado-republican-caucuses-confusion/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 3:53:56,,"For Republicans in Colorado, this Super Tuesday might be feeling a little, well, ordinary.
Thanks to a contentious decision by the state GOP last summer, voters there won't be casting ballots for a primary contestant, but rather a delegate -- bound to no candidate -- to attend future meetings. There will be no presidential preference poll, no big winner thanking Centennial State voters for putting a charge into his campaign.
But what possible reason could Colorado Republicans have for choosing to essentially forfeit their plum seat at the 2016 primary table?
The answer traces back to a decision by the national party to tweak their formula entering this year's contests. Going forward, the winner in any state that holds a preference poll would be required to bind its delegates to the winner.
In a statement this weekend, Colorado GOP Chairman Steve House responded to the ""many questions"" he had received about his executive committee's decision.
""There is no such thing as a binding preference poll because when you actually award delegates via a poll it's not a poll -- it's an election,"" House wrote. ""So what's wrong with an election? Nothing if you are actually going to run it with all the precautions and security measures of an actual election.""
House called the prospect of using a ""straw poll"" an ""unacceptable gamble,"" citing the threat of fraud and abuse of ""systemic loopholes.""
Instead, he explained, the state party would employ a ""controlled and secure four-step process.""
This more arduous path to winning Colorado's national delegates will also make it more difficult for supporters of a losing candidate -- like those who backed Ron Paul in 2012 -- to take advantage of nonbinding poll results.
Still, there has been significant blowback inside the state. The Denver Post editorial board on Sunday rejected House's explanations and said the decision ""looks worse with every passing day.""
Instead of having their say in this historically divisive contest, the board wrote, Colorado voters will ""stand on the sidelines on Super Tuesday while other states determine whether Donald Trump continues his march toward a possible nomination or whether his rivals can slow him down.""
But it's not all bad news for those disappointed Colorado voters. With the GOP race potentially stretching into April, when county assemblies and a state convention will be held, the candidates might yet be inclined to schedule some time on the Rocky Mountain campaign trails.

Delegate bonanza or survival fight,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/super-tuesday-highlights/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 17:00:58,,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could make huge strides toward their party's nominations Tuesday as a dozen states vote in primaries and caucuses on the most consequential day yet in the presidential race.
The Super Tuesday contests are a delegate bonanza for front-runners and a test of survival for others as voters head to the polls across the nation, including in the Deep South, in Colorado and Texas, in ice-bound Alaska and Minnesota and in Bernie Sanders' fortress of Vermont.
Trump is expected to notch a large number of victories that could help him stretch his lead in the GOP White House battle and underscore his growing support across all sectors of the Republican coalition. Those wins could come despite being embroiled in a GOP fight that has rival candidates and party elders, desperate to stop his march to the nomination, branding him unfit for the presidency.
His Republican foe Ted Cruz faces a must-win primary in his home state of Texas while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is a long shot to squeeze out his debut victory of the campaign after ditching his previously elevated and aspirational campaign to wage a bitter and personal war of words with Trump.
Super Tuesday: What to watch
Clinton, meanwhile, looks set to build on her huge win in South Carolina on Saturday to sweep through southern primaries where her overwhelming advantage over Sanders among African-American voters is almost certain to be decisive.
Sanders, who is keen to challenge the growing narrative that the former secretary of state is now on track to win the nomination, hopes to halt the Clinton tide in Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma and will likely pocket Vermont.
A total of 595 Republican delegates are up for grabs in 11 states of the 1,237 needed to clinch the GOP nomination in 11 states. Sanders and Clinton are facing off in 11 states for 865 of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the Democratic race.
Super Tuesday is coming at a pivotal moment in the Republican race. It has finally dawned on rival campaigns and alarmed party establishment figures that Trump â€” after three thumping wins in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada â€” will win the nomination unless there is a dramatic reversal of fortunes.
The former reality television star who has turned American politics upside down with his outsider campaign, nationwide media blitz and crusade against political correctness, is going into Super Tuesday with his polling hitting new peaks.
GOP's Trump revolt: Too little too late?
A national XXX/ORC poll published on Monday shows that Trump has lifted the ceiling on his support that for months hovered around 30% and now has the support of 49% of Republican voters, more than 30 points ahead of Rubio and Cruz. 
Quality polling has been sporadic in some Super Tuesday states, but there are clear signs that Trump leads in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Virginia and Tennessee. Cruz appears to be clinging to a moderate lead in Texas.
Trump's surge has some senior party figures registering alarm that his presence at the top of the Republican ticket, given his controversial rhetoric and stances on issues like immigration, could cost the party not just the White House but control of the Senate as well.
""We can't have a nominee be an albatross around the down-ballot races,"" Republican Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told XXX Monday when asked if he had concerns about the prospect of Trump winning the GOP race. ""That's a concern of mine.""
Exacerbating the fears of the party establishment, Trump struggled Monday to extricate himself from a controversy that erupted after he initially failed to disavow the support of David Duke, a leader of the Ku Klux Klan, during a XXX interview. Trump blamed a malfunctioning earpiece for the oversight but his rivals pounced.
""I don't care how bad the earpiece is, Ku Klux Klan comes through pretty clearly,"" Rubio said during a rally in Tennessee on Monday.
Super Tuesday was once seen by the Cruz campaign as the moment when the Texas senator would build on his support among ideological and evangelical conservative voters and sweep across the South. But Trump upset his best-laid plans.
Now Cruz is left with a nervous wait to see if he will win his home state of Texas, which has the most delegates available Tuesday with 155. Failure to convert a win on home ground would effectively end his campaign.
Cruz rehearsed an argument on Monday that only he, and not Rubio has shown the capacity to win states and to take on Trump.
""I believe after Super Tuesday, we will see this race become more and more a two man race,"" Cruz told reporters on Monday.
National poll: Clinton, Sanders both top Trump
""I think the likely outcome of tomorrow - Donald is going to come out with a whole bunch of delegates. I believe we're going to come out with a whole bunch of delegates. And I think everyone else will be way, way behind.""
Since Tuesday's contests will award delegates proportionally based on a candidate's share of the vote as long as they reach a certain threshold in some states, it will not be possible for Trump to clinch the nomination outright on Tuesday night.
Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are clinging to the hope that they could win their own states on March 15, when contests start to become winner take-all affairs, and eventually overhaul Trump's delegate total.
Rubio is building a case that Trump would be a disaster for Republicans and that only he could unite the party and beat Clinton in a general election.
""I intend to be in this race as long as it takes to prevent someone like Donald Trump who is not a conservative and is a con man from taking over the conservative movement and the party of Reagan,"" Rubio told Fox News on Monday. ""I do not believe Donald Trump can get 1,237 delegates, which is what you need to become the nominee. And I will never give up the fight.""
Clinton's aides know that she cannot knock out Sanders on Tuesday, but they hope to end the night with a lead of around 100 earned delegates.
Sanders is making clear that despite the size of his defeat in South Carolina -- equal to nearly 50% of the vote -- he is nowhere near giving up his campaign, though the candidate himself appears to have rock-bottom expectations in the South.
A Monmouth University poll of the Democratic race published Monday suggested Sanders is in good shape in at least one of those target states, showing that he leads the former secretary of state by 48% to 43% in Oklahoma.
And in Massachusetts, in his last pre-Super Tuesday rally on Monday night, the Vermont senator had an upbeat message.
""Tomorrow there will be 700 delegates up for deciding. We anticipate winning many of them and a majority of them right here in Massachusetts,"" he said.
Clinton, however, appeared to be looking on toward the general election -- and Donald Trump.
""You know America never stopped being great,"" she said in Northern Virginia, referring to Trump's campaign slogan. ""We have to make America whole.""

Donald Trump and the battle for the soul of America,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/trump-and-americas-soul-obeidallah/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 18:18:59,,"There's a good chance that Donald Trump will be the GOP's presidential nominee, if dominance on Super Tuesday is any indication of what's to come, and that means this November's election will not just be a battle for the White House. 
It will be a fight for the soul of America. 
I'm far from alone in this view. We have even seen Republicans such as Sen. Ben Sasse from Nebraska and a number of other conservatives denouncing Trump and pledging that they will not vote for him if he's the GOP nominee. 
They get it: Trump is the antithesis of ""E pluribus unum,"" which appears on the seal of our great nation This Latin expression, which America's Founding Fathers coined, means, ""out of many, one."" 
In contrast to what the Founders intended with these words, Trump's campaign has intentionally tried to divide us by playing on the fears of Americans, many of which attach to race, religion and ethnicity. 
But beyond the nativist views he has espoused (let's call them what they are: bigoted), his tolerance for hate speech and his emboldening of white supremacists, there are also his recent words that appear to support less freedom of expression for Americans. This should also alarm all people who truly love what makes America exceptional. 
The most recent example came Sunday when XXX's Jake Tapper asked Trump if he would denounce the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and other white supremacist groups. Incredibly Trump responded, ""I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists."" 
How can Trump think anyone could actually believe he doesn't know who Duke or the Klan are? After all in 2000, Trump quit the Reform Party when Duke joined, declaring, ""This is not company I wish to keep."" Even more baffling was that three days before the XXX interview, Trump tossed off a quick disavowal of Duke to the media. 
Yet two days before the Super Tuesday primaries in the South, on national TV Trump  tells us he's unaware of his new supporter Duke and the man's role in the Klan. Did Trump not offer a passionate condemnation of Duke and the Klan because, by his own calculation, that could potentially lose him votes in certain primary states? (After the media firestorm erupted, Trump's amnesia cleared, and he tweeted his disavowal of Duke.)
Trump may have settled on distancing himself from Duke, but we now learn that the Trump campaign gave press credentials for an event Saturday to the white supremacist media outlet ""The Political Cesspool Radio Program."" The program bills itself as ""unapologetically pro-White."" To put this in perspective, consider that the Trump campaign refused to extend press credentials to BuzzFeed, The Des Moines (Iowa) Register and Fusion because it viewed their reporters' coverage as too critical. 
The man who wants to be our president shows an ever increasing lack of tolerance for the media and even individuals who dare protest or are critical of him. Just a week ago Trump made a comment that should raise the hair on the back of the neck of any American who believes in a free and vibrant press. Trump told his supporters, ""One of the things I'm going to do if I win ... I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money."" 
Regardless of whether Trump could actually change the libel laws as he suggests, he is making it clear that he would pursue polices as president that would try to rein in criticism of him. This is a sentiment you would expect to hear in a Third World country ruled by a dictator, not the United States of America.
We have even seen a pattern by Trump of apparently trying to silence private citizens who disagree with him. I'm not talking about protesters simply being thrown out of events for interrupting him, which happens with just about all presidential candidates. I'm talking about Trump telling the crowd that the security officers were being too nice to the protester being thrown out, noting, ""I'd like to punch him in the face."" 
Trump also publicly applauded supporters who physically ejected a woman from a rally two weeks ago in South Carolina. What was her ""crime""? She simply stood in silence giving Trump the middle finger. Trump won't even tolerate silent dissent. This is not how we do things in America.
Worse, Trump shockingly defended an assault by his supporters upon a Black Lives Matter protester at a rally in November, telling Fox News the next day, ""Maybe he should have been roughed up."" Again, this is from a man who aspires to be our president.
And on a person level, since I'm Muslim, one of the most chilling moments of the campaign came when Trump encouraged his supporters to cheer for his proposal to engage in warrantless, wholesale surveillance of American Muslims, saying, ""I want surveillance of these people."" 
The idea that Muslims are not fellow Americans but ""these people"" is truly frightening. History has taught us that when a leader dehumanizes a minority group, it can lead to horrific consequences for that group.
The stakes in the 2016 election are simply too high for voters to be bound by political affiliation or ideology.  If you believe America is a nation where white supremacists should be loudly denounced, where ethnic and religious groups should not be demonized for political gain or have fewer rights, and where freedom of expression is valued, then you must take a stand in 2016.
 Our nation's soul depends on it."
Donald Trump's latest nomination contest is with GOP,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/donald-trump-republican-establishment-fight/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 23:38:32,,"Super Tuesday winners expect better.
But there's never been a presidential candidate like Donald Trump, and while the billionaire's willingness to buck convention has been a strength in the tumultuous 2016 race, it came with a downside Wednesday.
Any other candidate would be embraced by his party as a conquering hero after Tuesday night's wins. Instead, he's getting the cold shoulder reserved for an especially obstinate unwanted guest from GOP leaders who see him as a toxic influence that could cost them the White House and Senate -- and leave a stain on the party of Lincoln, if not tear it apart.
Trump might have cemented his role as front-runner in the GOP race, but he now faces a tricky period as he tries to put the nomination truly beyond reach of his rivals, and not only the ones on the ballot. He faces accelerating efforts by conservatives and establishment figures alike to thwart his White House dreams at the 11th hour. 
""We all agree Trump as the nominee would be a disaster morally, politically, and electorally. Well, then, let's do something about it,"" prominent talk radio host Steve Deace, who has endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, wrote in a Facebook post late Tuesday.

Some lawmakers are also beginning to break with precedent and repudiate the party's front-runner. Nebraska's Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said over the weekend he won't vote for Trump even if he becomes the nominee.
And Virginia GOP Rep. Scott Rigell warned on ""The Lead"" with Jake Tapper Wednesday that he would not vote for Trump either, arguing that he lacked judgment on foreign policy and was not fit to be commander in chief.
""This extremis moment that we are in, in our country -- the solution is not Donald Trump,"" Rigell said. ""I truly believe he would harm our country.""
Yet many Republican voters feel differently. Trump enjoyed a seven-state romp on Super Tuesday to take his primary and caucus win total to 10. Traditionally at this point he'd be wallowing in the plaudits of his party and tasting the power endowed by his first few hours as its presumptive presidential nominee.
After winning a swath of states with diverse ideological, geographical and demographic profiles, like Trump has, such a candidate would expect his main foes to fold their campaigns to fall in behind him -- especially in an election likely to feature Democrat Hillary Clinton, a rallying point for GOP hatred for decades.
RELATED: GOP reaches a crossroads
Instead, Trump must brace for a torrent of revelations from his own side about his business practices, his personality, what he really believes behind closed doors and questions on whether he's qualified to preside over a nuclear arsenal from opponents who balk at his takeover of their party.
It could be an onslaught with far more punch than the nascent #NeverTrump meme on Twitter -- started by Republicans.
As an anti-Trump movement gathered force Wednesday, former Republican nominee Mitt Romney scheduled a high-profile speech on the race on Thursday in which he's expected to criticize Trump. GOP candidate Ben Carson pulled out of Thursday's Republican debate and told supporters in a press release Wednesday that he saw no path forward, in a move that could help Trump rivals Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
And doubts over Trump are not confined to his politics in a year in which conservatives had high hopes of nominating the most ideologically pure nominee since Ronald Reagan.  
There is also deep skepticism among some conservatives about his behavior and explosive rhetoric as well. Many Republicans feel Trump's emotive language toward groups including Mexicans, women and Muslims is disqualifying.
""This is a guy who has made, shall we say, racially insensitive remarks, things that conservatives who care about defending the cause of conservatism cannot in good conscience abide,"" said Matt Lewis, a XXX commentator and author of a new book that argues the Republican party has betrayed its conservative roots.
Former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay told XXX's Brooke Baldwin that he hoped Romney would lead an effort to explain that the race is not over.
""Trump ought to take a pause. He lost four states last night, which shows he is vulnerable. He only has right now 300 delegates. He needs 1,237,"" DeLay said.
DeLay is technically correct that Trump has yet to put the nomination out of reach of Rubio and Cruz. The theory of his opponents is that once more states hand out delegates on a winner-take-all basis after March 15, his lead of around 100 delegates over Cruz and 200 over Rubio could be overhauled should either of them start claiming more first-place finishes. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is also hoping to stack up delegates when the race hits the Midwest.
At the very least, Trump opponents hope to prevent the real estate mogul from harvesting sufficient delegates to clinch the nomination before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in July.

But Trump has advantages that could blunt any organized GOP bids to thwart him -- just as he has succeeded in bending the contours of the presidential race to his will throughout his campaign.
In his press conference on Tuesday night, he several times delivered a veiled warning to Republican Party leaders that they would be taking on more than just his campaign if they resorted to attacks on his character.
""But remember this. I have millions and millions and millions of people,"" he said in a possible reference to his earlier warnings that he could bolt the party and mount an independent bid for president if he was not treated fairly.
No other candidate has greater momentum or a greater claim to the nomination at this point. His closest rival, Cruz, has only won three states and Rubio just one. A bid to wrest the party banner away from his hands would risk alienating his fervent supporters, who might then repudiate any subsequent nominee that emerges.
RELATED: The backlash against Chris Christie
Furthermore, Trump's strength in recent Southern nominating contests suggests he will run strongly in primaries and caucuses in places like Louisiana and Kentucky Saturday and next week in Mississippi. The Rubio camp's theory that a victory in his home state of Florida on March 15 will buckle the billionaire's hopes of the nomination is undercut by a recent Sunshine State poll showing Trump with a clear lead.
In another odd twist, Trump's loss in Texas, the biggest state of Super Tuesday with 155 delegates, may have actually helped him, since Cruz's win gave him a rationale to stay in the race. That ensures opposition to the billionaire will remain fractured for a few more weeks at least.
And while it is possible to pick holes in Trump's path to the nomination, his route is far more credible than those of his rivals.
Many pundits have long suggested that Trump has a ceiling of around 30% in the polls and would slump once the field narrowed.
But he hit 49% in Massachusetts, 39% in Tennessee and 43% in Alabama on Tuesday. In a new XXX national poll this week, Trump reached 49% support among all Republican voters.
In a bid to underpin his wins on Super Tuesday, Trump argued at a victory lap press conference that he was a ""unifier"" and took immediate aim at Clinton, possibly to help GOP voters envisage a presidential race that could bring the party together, its numbers swelled by new Trump voters.
""We are expanding the party,"" he said. ""Once we get all of this finished, I am going to go after one person -- that is Hillary Clinton.""
And in a possible sign of a tack Tuesday towards female voters important in a general election -- who may feel alienated by his rhetoric -- Trump noted that millions of women had been helped by Planned Parenthood, an organization reviled by conservatives.
Still, not all of Trump's positioning appears to be working. If securing the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was meant to confer establishment approval on his campaign, it backfired. The former GOP presidential candidate has been widely lampooned over a move that seemed to fly in the face of his previous criticisms of Trump's fitness to serve as president. And Christie became the subject of Twitter mockery over his apparent discomfort on stage during Trump's news conference on Tuesday night.

And there were some warning signs in the results on Tuesday. Following predictions that he could sweep up to 10 Super Tuesday states, Trump had to content himself with seven. He faced a tougher fight in a crucial swing state -- Virginia -- than polls had predicted, in a sign that not all Republican voters are reconciled to having the former reality star as their presidential nominee.
Exit polls showed that voters who made up their minds there in the last few days chose Rubio, a possible indication that the Florida senator's furious attacks on his rival's character and business record may have had an impact over the last week.
""Five days ago, we began to explain to the American people that Donald Trump is a con artist,"" Rubio told supporters in Florida on Tuesday night.
""In just five days, we have seen the impact it is having all across the country,"" he continued. ""We are seeing in state after state -- he loves to talk about polls -- we are seeing in state after state his numbers coming down, our numbers going up.""
That kind of evidence may embolden Republican opponents of Trump -- and a super PAC effort currently lining up against him staffed by establishment Republican operatives -- to test what damage a full-bore negative advertising assault on Trump's character and business record could wreak on the billionaire's polling.
But there is little precedent in this campaign for any effort by establishment figures to succeed in denting his hopes. It's even possible that efforts by the likes of Romney might do more to endear Trump with his loyal outsider base of voters than to harm him among traditional Republicans.

Donald Trump's Super Tuesday press conference,http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2016/03/02/donald-trump-super-tuesday-entire-speech-sot.cnn,cnn,3/2/2016 4:43:18,,
Donald Trump stands by softer tone on Planned Parenthood,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/donald-trump-planned-parenthood-good-work/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 6:02:05,,"Donald Trump on Tuesday night once again sought to strike a softer tone on Planned Parenthood, paying tribute to its ""very good work for millions of women"" while also keeping up a threat to cut off federal funding to the organization if it continues to offer abortion services. 
With Super Tuesday victories in his back pocket, Trump at a press conference in South Florida pledged to expand the base of the Republican Party, calling himself a ""common sense conservative"" while assuring voters he considered women's health issues ""very important.""
""Planned Parenthood has done very good work for millions of women,"" he said. ""But we're not going to allow and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood. We understand that, and I've said it loud and clear.""
""We'll see what happens,"" he continued, ""but I've had thousands of letters from women that have been helped. This wasn't a set-up, this was people writing letters.""
Of his tack on Planned Parenthood, Trump conceded it was ""not a perfect conservative view,"" but offered a counterweight by promising to be ""more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall."" 
Trump's comments Tuesday night echoed those he made less than a week earlier at the XXX Republican debate in Houston.
""As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life, I'm totally against abortion having to do with Planned Parenthood,"" the GOP front-runner said on Thursday. ""But millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by Planned Parenthood. So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly.""
Trump's Republican primary rivals have repeatedly questioned his anti-abortion credentials, often referencing a 1999 appearance on ""Meet the Press"" in which he described himself as ""pro-choice in every respect."" 
More recently, during an interview with XXX's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" in August, Trump raised eyebrows by saying he was ""sure"" Planned Parenthood did ""some things properly and good and good for women, and I would look at that.""
Among the most vocal doubters has been Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who at his own Super Tuesday rally said Trump ""supports Planned Parenthood."" By contrast, Cruz said, ""I will direct the Justice Department to investigate"" the organization.
Planned Parenthood itself also sought to undermine Trump's message, dismissing any suggestion of a moderate turn and saying in a statement he had ""built his presidential campaign on racism, misogyny and xenophobia.""
""Trump would ban abortion, and eliminate women's ability to have birth control covered by health insurance,"" Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in an email. ""A Trump presidency would be a disaster for women.""

Exit polls: Super Tuesday's top takeaways,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/exit-polls-super-tuesday-takeaways/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 20:59:35,,"Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton emerged stronger from Super Tuesday than when they entered, picking up solid wins in Southern states and boosting their delegate leads over their respective opponents. But exit polling data from across the dozen states where voters to took to the polls offered interesting insights into the electorate.

Despite all the tough talk from the Republican candidates about deporting illegal immigrants, GOP voters in most Super Tuesday states said they support offering legal status to undocumented workers. 
In Texas, which has among the highest share of undocumented immigrants in the labor force, some 47% of Republican voters want to offer them legal status, while 43% would rather deport them, according to exit polls. 
In Georgia, which has a growing Latino community, the split is 53%-39%.
Only in Alabama did voters prefer to deport these immigrants, by a 50% to 45% split.
The billionaire businessman handily won seven state races on Tuesday, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz besting him in three states and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio securing one win.
Immigration has been a key talking point in the Republican campaign, with candidates sparring with each other over their positions. Trump has said repeatedly that he would build a wall with Mexico to keep undocumented workers from crossing the border. 

The thrice married Trump, who at times brought his personal copy of the Bible on the campaign trail, was the favorite of voters in Southern states for whom ""shared values"" mattered.
In Alabama, Trump won 43% of the total vote compared to runner-up Ted Cruz's 21%. It was a state where 78% of voters said they cared about shared values with the candidate they supported: Trump won 39% of them, compared to 26% for Cruz, the son of an evangelical preacher.
Trump also won those voters in Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, and coming within a point of Cruz in Arkansas.
And Trump was also tops for those who identified as born-again or evangelical voters, also driving his victories. In Alabama, Trump won 44% of voters who identified as such, compared to 22% for runner-up Cruz.

Cruz's hopes to win the Republican presidential nomination were pinned in large part on winning his home state of Texas, a delegate rich state up for grabs on Tuesday. And he did: 44% to Trump's 27%. 
And while he was no doubt buoyed by his familiarity with the state -- and voters' familiarity with him -- Cruz also was able to pull off an interesting feat: winning support of voters on both sides of the immigration debate.
That is, Cruz was the top choice of Texas voters who think undocumented immigrants in the U.S. should be offered legal status and those who think they should be deported to their home county. The Texas senator, who rivals have at times accused of flip-flopping on the controversial issue (which he denies), seems to have found a way to thread the needle in the Lone Star State.
Among voters who said undocumented workers should be offered legal status, Cruz won 38% compared to Sen. Marco Rubio's 29%. Among those who think they should be deported, 47% picked Cruz compared to 34% for Trump.

Speaking of Texas, Clinton's win there was buoyed by her victories among minority voters. She won 83% of African-American voters, compared to Sanders' 15% and she won 71% of the Latino voters, compared to 29% for Sanders, according to exit polling.
And it wasn't just there: In Alabama, Clinton won 89% of the non-white vote, in Arkansas she won 83%, in Georgia she won 81%, in Tennessee she won 85% and in Virginia she won 76%.
But in Oklahoma, where Sanders defeated her 52% to 42%, Clinton won minority voters by a narrower margin, 56% compared to Sanders' 40%.

On the Democratic side, Clinton won seven contests compared to rival Bernie Sanders' four. But where the Vermont senator did win, it was clear his appeal to independents helped tip the scales. 
No exit poll data was available for Sanders' victories in the Colorado and Minnesota caucuses, but in Oklahoma and Vermont, the senator posted solid wins among independents. In Oklahoma, 27% of voters said they were independents; of those, nearly 7-in-10 voted for Sanders.
And in Sanders' home state of Vermont the contrast was even more stark: Of the 4-in-10 voters who identified as independents, 92% voters for him.

Sanders' campaign centers on income inequality. But that message didn't win him followers in many Super Tuesday states. 
Clinton won the clear majority of voters in six states who said that the U.S. economy generally favors the wealthy. She secured more than 60% of these voters in each of these states.
Sanders, on the other hand, squeaked by in two states, winning 51% in Massachusetts and 54% in Oklahoma. Only in his home state of Vermont did 88% of voters who think the system is rigged vote for him.
Overall, Clinton won seven Super Tuesday states, while Sanders secured victory in four.

Rubio earned the support of those with college and postgraduate degrees in Oklahoma and Virginia, and those with postgraduate degrees in Arkansas and Georgia. 
Those with less than a college degree turned out for Trump in nearly every state. The front-runner said ""I love the poorly educated"" in his Nevada victory speech last month.
Only in Texas did Cruz win the top spot among voters across the educational spectrum.

"First on XXX: Ted Cruz could have dropped out if he lost Texas, chief strategist says",http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/ted-cruz-texas-super-tuesday/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 23:28:25,,"Ted Cruz would have seriously considered dropping out of the Republican presidential race had he lost his home state of Texas on Super Tuesday, his campaign's chief strategist told donors Wednesday. 
In a detailed 30-minute call with several dozen donors, Jason Johnson said that Cruz himself was comfortable stepping aside if he had lost Texas. Cruz won the state handily, although some polls showed a tighter race headed into Election Day. Cruz went into the year anticipating a strong showing in the Southern states on Super Tuesday, but only came away with wins in Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska, and trails Trump by more than 100 delegates.
""Last night, when we were going through the different scenarios on what might occur, the senator asked what if we lose Texas,"" Johnson said. ""And I said that's simple: You don't have to do it on the stage, but you clearly stand there and remind people that 'tonight is not a reflection of the ideas, the issues, the vision, etc. But clearly we now have to pull back and pray and think about who we throw our support behind in order to reignite the promise of America -- because clearly it ain't me.'"" 
Johnson said his boss was receptive to that. 
""Well there was zero pushback from Ted Cruz,"" Johnson told the fundraisers. ""You might say it's a duh. But it's not a duh."" 
""You get into this campaign. And it's so hard to let go,"" he said, but telling the donors they are clear-eyed about the path ahead. ""This is not a campaign that will resist letting go if the path is not there."" 
CNN listened to the call after obtaining information about it from a participant. The Cruz campaign did not comment regarding Johnson's discussions with the senator over dropping out.
The discussion of Cruz leaving the race comes as Republicans continue to fight over who is best poised to take on Trump. Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have both outlined paths to victory to their supporters, as has Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
""Tomorrow morning, we have a choice. If the field remains divided, Donald Trump will be the nominee,"" Cruz told supporters in Texas on Tuesday evening. ""For the candidates who have not yet won a state, who have not racked up significant delegates, I ask you to prayerfully consider coming together, uniting."" 

Cruz plans to offer an ""olive branch"" in Thursday night's Republican debate to voters currently not supporting him, Johnson told donors, part of what he pitched as an aggressive, intentional effort to make Cruz more attractive to voters who are unfriendly to the Texas firebrand's style. 
""If I'm a voter siting out there,"" Johnson said, ""and Ted Cruz isn't my first choice but Donald Trump is my last choice -- and I believe Ted Cruz is the best way to beat Donald Trump -- it needs to be easy for that person to come to the Ted Cruz campaign."" 
Johnson told donors the campaign believes Cruz has a significantly more viable path to the GOP nomination than did Marco Rubio, who Johnson portrayed as a major stumbling block to beating Trump in a one-on-one race. But he also expressed severe skepticism that the anti-Trump forces would consolidate quickly, saying that Rubio is very unlikely to be convinced that his path is improbable, potentially leading Trump to the GOP nomination. 
Cruz has fought criticism over his strategy from some of his own allies about his reluctance to take on Trump earlier in the campaign,  when he mostly trained his fire on Rubio.
""I needed to build my base of support. I needed to take care so that I was on a strong foundation first before I could take him on,"" he told XXX's Dana Bash on Tuesday evening, pushing back on the idea that Cruz missed his chance to define Trump. ""Not remotely. This is an ongoing conversation.""
The campaign is eager for Rubio to lose Florida on March 15. But it is also bullish on Cruz's chances in Kansas, Louisiana, Idaho, Michigan, and surprisingly, in Johnson's eyes, Maine. Two states where Johnson was skeptical of Cruz's chances: Mississippi, which he called a ""big question mark"" and labeled it more ""populist than conservative,"" and Hawaii. 
Johnson cast significant doubt on the path forward for Rubio, who is increasingly staking his campaign's viability on a win in Florida later this month, characterizing Rubio's path as ""Doug Flutie with the hangover with the Hail Mary pass on Saturday morning of going to the 15th."" And he called Rubio's recent penchant for insults with Trump a significant black mark on Rubio's presidential aspirations -- as much as the Cruz team enjoyed them. 
""As entertaining as it was during the last debate -- and frankly as therapeutic it was for people, myself included -- to watch Marco engage in his old locker room glory days of trading insults and following up the next week talking about the size of Donald Trump's hands -- it's not going to get the job done,"" Johnson said. ""What's going to get the job done is contrasting in a presidential way with Donald Trump."" 
"
GOP faces brutal choice on Trump,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/super-tuesday-trump-gop-louis/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 20:39:17,,"Only days after feuding with Pope Francis, childishly mocking a rival and offering a patently ridiculous explanation for why he failed to denounce the support of a Ku Klux Klan leader immediately, Donald Trump unveiled a more serious and conciliatory side following his impressive multistate victories on Super Tuesday. Trump 2.0, the conservative Hot Air website called it. 
""We're going to be a much bigger party. We're going to be an expanded party,"" said the normally combative Trump, who even offered a bit of an olive branch to the press, claiming, ""I'm becoming diplomatic.""
He'll need a lot more talk like that to calm the fears of nervous GOP leaders. Several senior Republicans say they will not support Trump under any circumstances, and the party's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, is expected to deliver pointed remarks about the state of the race this week. 
One reason for the rising panic among much of the so-called Republican establishment over Trump's sweeping Super Tuesday victories is that the same erratic style and divisive policies that work so well for him -- calling for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, a halt on all immigration by Muslims and building a massive wall on the Mexico border -- probably won't work for many of his fellow Republicans running for re-election to Congress this year.  
Republicans are defending 24 Senate seats this fall, and losing five of them will mean losing control of the chamber back to the Democrats. 
In swing states, including New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, Republican senators and congressmen will need the active support of independents and Democrats -- precisely the kind of voters most turned off by Trump's harsh rhetoric, petty insults, factual errors and hard-line promises.  
""We can't have a nominee be an albatross around the down-ballot races,"" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas recently told XXX. ""That's a concern of mine.""
Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, agrees: ""It's a concern to have Trump at the top of the ticket, no doubt, for anybody on the ballot."" 
Flake and Cornyn have cause to be concerned. Consider the plight of Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who won by a razor-thin 2% margin in 2010. Toomey can't win without making inroads among Democrats and independents in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but that task will be monumentally harder with the volatile Trump at the top of the ticket. 
It gets worse for Toomey, a fiscal conservative who once was president of the anti-tax Club for Growth. Last fall the group ran an ad campaign attacking Trump before the Iowa caucuses and would have a hard time making peace with the candidate if he becomes the nominee. And just when he most needs the help of a unified local party to help him, Toomey -- who is backing his fellow senator, Marco Rubio, for president -- has already seen one congressman from Pennsylvania decide to back Trump, and others may do the same. 
In New Hampshire, Sen. Kelly Ayotte is fighting off a stiff challenge by the state's Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan -- and, like Toomey, is relying on crossover Democrats and independent voters to help her win re-election. That task gets complicated if Trump is the leading Republican at the top of the ticket: She recently called Trump's initial refusal to disavow an ex-Ku Klux Klan leader ""disgusting and offensive.""
Sen. Ron Johnson, facing a tough re-election fight in Wisconsin and trailing in the polls behind ex-Sen. Russ Feingold, is expressing worry about Trump's impact on his race.  And two of the highest-ranking Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature ""say they won't support Trump and would consider voting for a conservative third-party candidate in the general election if he's the nominee,"" according to the Wisconsin State Journal. 
In Ohio, Sen. Rob Portman is explicitly seeking distance: ""I'm not a rabble-rousing, red-meat Donald Trump guy,"" he told The Washington Post. And Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois bluntly broke with Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric: ""In a typical Chicago way, to my Mexican-American friends, I would say, 'Donald Trump callate' -- shut up.""
An internal memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee outlined the danger last fall in a section called ""Donald Trump is a Misguided Missile"": ""Let's face facts. Donald Trump says what's on his mind and that's a problem,"" the memo says. ""Our candidates will have to spend full time defending him or condemning him if that continues."" 
Nothing about Trump's Super Tuesday wins changes that hard reality. No matter how much the new ""diplomatic"" Trump tries to mend fences, Democrats have a large body of videos and documented statements showing him using or accepting profanity, inaccuracies, violence at rallies, bigoted statements and other rowdy behavior. 
That leaves party leaders with a difficult choice: Back Trump's bid and risk losing control of the Senate, or hang onto control of Congress for dear life -- and let Trump stand or fall without help from the establishment for which he has expressed such contempt."
GOP lawmakers brace for Trump nomination,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-congress-gop/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 2:03:10,,"Donald Trump appears on track to secure the Republican presidential nomination, but some top congressional Republicans have never met him, and their private anxiety about running on the same ticket as the unpredictable billionaire businessman is starting to go public. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan had one brief conversation with Trump at a political event when he was Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012, but hasn't spoken to him since. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made headlines recently saying he could work with Trump, but an aide tells XXX the two have never sat down together.   
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has acknowledged he received political donations from Trump, but the last time they spoke was by phone last year. Like Ryan, McConnell regularly refuses to comment on the GOP presidential contest, other than saying that he thought the Republican nominee in 2016 should be someone who can win in ""purple states.""
With Trump poised to rack up more wins in several states voting on Super Tuesday the reality of a reality star leading the Grand Old Party this fall is starting to sink in on Capitol Hill.
The No. 2 Senate GOP leader, Sen. John Cornyn issued the strongest warning to date on Monday about Trump telling XXX , ""We can't have a nominee be an albatross around the down-ballot races, that's a concern of mine.""
Cornyn said he has met Trump but never thought he would run for president. 
""I think he certainly is a controversial figure -- I think we need someone who can unify the party, as opposed to divide the party,"" he said.
Sen. Ron Johnson, who is up for re-election in the blue state of Wisconsin, told reporters Monday, ""I literally pray every night that our nominee is someone with integrity, intelligence, courage and ideas -- so I'm going to keep praying.""
Asked if that could be Trump, Johnson wouldn't be pinned down. 
""We'll see how this process plays out,"" he said.
Rep. Chris Collins of New York is one of the few Republicans on the Hill who does have a relationship with Trump, telling XXX the two met in 2014 to discuss the businessman's interest in a possible gubernatorial race.  Collins initially backed Jeb Bush for president, but became the first member of Congress to endorse Trump last week. 
The New York Republican predicted GOP anxiety about Trump will fade, ""because Hillary Clinton is the big uniter. The Supreme Court -- bigger issues are at play. First, Second Tenth Amendment and Supreme Court are at play. She is the great uniter.""
But another New York Republican, Rep. Peter King, said on XXX Monday that Trump becoming the standard bearer for Republicans, would at best ""be a short-term victory"" but on balance ""it's a terrible loss.""
King said initially he thought Trump had the potential to bring new voters into the Republican Party. But after a string of controversial comments, King endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio last week, and said if Trump won the nomination, ""he's going to put a scar on the party that we're not going to recover from for a long time.""
But the Senate's most senior Republican, Orrin Hatch of Utah, struck a more conciliatory tone. He said if Trump does beat his preferred candidate, Rubio, he could campaign for the real estate mogul.
""If he's our nominee, I'll do everything I can to elect him,"" Hatch told XXX .
Multiple Republicans XXX interviewed did agree that having Trump face Clinton in November was better than having Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz as the party's nominee, because Trump's appeal wasn't limited to just conservative primary voters. But few have a firm grasp on what it would be like to work with a President Trump if he took office in 2017.
""We disagree on taxes. We disagree on privacy. We disagree on private property. He doesn't seem to understand Obamacare,"" one senior House GOP leadership aide told XXX , adding, ""Donald Trump in the Republican primary is supposed to be different than Donald Trump in the general, so I don't know.""
While Cornyn is sounding alarm bells about the damage Trump could do, other Republicans say whether or not Trump is a positive or a negative factor is a function of where you live.
South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney pointed to polls showing Trump running competitive nationally, saying he can help GOP candidates in places like the Northeast where the party has struggled in the past.
""How does having a Republican presidential candidate not help you if you are running in upstate New York, or even in Connecticut or Massachusetts or Pennsylvania?"" Mulvaney, who hasn't endorsed anyone since his preferred candidate, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, dropped out of the race. He told reporters he still hasn't seen any evidence that Trump works against Republican candidates. 
Rep. Scott Garrett, who represents a competitive northern New Jersey district, told XXX his constituents know Trump better than most others across the country. He hasn't endorsed anyone in the race either, and asked what it would be like to work with a President Trump, Garrett begged off, telling XXX , ""different from this administration, how's that?""
Even Collins acknowledged ""there's a lot of division"" and there are ""some worry warts"" trying to figure out how the businessman's high profile and sometimes controversial comments mean for them in November.
Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole, a former chair of the House GOP's campaign committee, has never met Trump. He told XXX that Trump and other GOP presidential candidates' stinging criticism of the Republican controlled Congress amounted to a ""cheap shot"" that hurts the party as it works to prove it can get things done.
""They're all playing into the anger. We had a pretty successful year last year and Republican presidential candidates telling Republican voters that the Republican Congress is the problem I think is exceptionally short sighted,"" Cole told XXX .
Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who is running for re-election this year told XXX , ""all of us are concerned, of course -- about the divisions in the party.""
While Cole wasn't ready to say Trump had the nomination locked up, he disagreed with the assessment of others in his party who believe he'll pose a problem for congressional candidates. 
""We're seeing really intense Republican energy and turnout and I think that will happen in November,"" he said.
Ryan stresses in national interviews that his most important job in 2016 is fashioning a detailed policy agenda for the eventual GOP nominee. But while top House GOP leaders and committee chairman are crafting legislation on a range of issues like replacing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, overhauling federal anti-poverty programs, it's unclear any of their proposals will be embraced by Trump.
Ryan continues to say he'll support whoever the nominee is, but he declined several attempts at his weekly press conference to explain why he thought Trump would endorse a platform developed by the same Republicans in Congress he has been running against for months.
Trump's success so far is based on avoiding specifics, and Collins argued he should avoid getting in the weeds on policy issues. 
""I think his leadership as a chief executive, his staying on the almost Reaganesque topline message: 'make America great again,' he's going to secure the borders, he's going to bring jobs back from China, stand firm with Russia, Iran, North Korea and ISIS. Those topline messages absolutely resonate throughout the country,""  Collins told XXX .
Cole told XXX that despite the rough primary rhetoric, he believes by time the political convention rolls around this summer that it's possible for the party to unite.
""You'll be amazed how quickly the wounds heal up, how fast everybody becomes 'good friends,'"" he said."
GOP reaches a crossroads,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/donald-trump-super-tuesday-republican-party/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 6:29:53,,"Donald Trump dominated Super Tuesday, notching seven victories -- more than three times as many as his closest competitor -- in states from Georgia to Massachusetts on a day that marked a turning point in his quest for the White House.
On the morning after, one thing is clear: the Republican party is at a crossroads
Many party leaders and establishment Republicans see two paths ahead. One is to accept what appears to be the increasingly likely outcome in the 2016 race â€” that Trump will soon clinch the GOP nomination â€” and offer the New York businessman their blessing. The second is a path of a historic rebellion: rejecting the GOP front-runner and the values and principles he stands for, and pledging to oppose Trump â€” even if he emerges as the party's nominee.
Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who ran for president in 2012, described this moment as an ""inflection point"" in the 2016 race and for the Republican Party.
""The party is fractured, which isn't unusual for political parties and they almost always come back together. But this could test the outer limits of that tradition,"" Pawlenty, who endorsed Marco Rubio, told XXX . ""If the Republican Party were an airplane and you're looking out the window, you'd see some pieces of the surface flying off. And you'd be wondering whether the engine or a wing is next.""
6 takeaways from Super Tuesday
With Trump adding delegates to his quickly growing stash Tuesday, political veterans suspect the GOP presidential race could reach a moment of unambiguous clarity in the next two weeks. That point could come on March 15 when Florida and Ohio vote. If Rubio, the Florida senator, and John Kasich, the Ohio governor, lose their home states, their campaigns would be doomed.
Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott put it this way: By March 15, Republicans will know whether it is time to ""throw up our hands in despair and panic.""
""We've now backed ourselves into a corner here -- and it's not very pretty,"" said Lott, who is supporting Kasich. Super Tuesday, Lott added, ""is not the final blow, but we will know in the next two weeks whether this is a done deal or not.""

In recent days, there has been a flurry of discussions among top Republican strategists and insiders about how to distance the party from Trump. His heated rhetoric about minority groups and immigrants is deeply troubling to party leaders who have spent years trying to make inroads with Latino and other minority constituencies. Also of grave concern are the down-ballot candidates who would face tough elections in November with Trump at the top of the ticket. 
Disaffected Republicans are discussing everything from skipping the Republican National Convention in July to running a conservative candidate as an independent or third-party candidate -- with the ultimate goal of denying Trump the presidency. One of the names frequently mentioned in this hypothetical is Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, even though he has shown no desire to run another campaign but has shown a zest for attacking Trump.
Trump's dominance on Super Tuesday caps the GOP front-runner's remarkable rise as a first-time presidential candidate. His initial surge in the polls months ago was widely dismissed as a short-lived phenomenon. His divisive and inflammatory rhetoric on everything from immigration to women drew fierce scorn from fellow Republicans and Democrats alike. 
But Trump's candidacy has proven shockingly durable, and his supporters exceptionally loyal. 
His dominant night comes just days after another development shocked the party to its core: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's bombshell endorsement of the billionaire last week. Christie ended his own presidential bid last month, and the unexpected decision from the former chairman of the Republican Governor's Association to back Trump â€” the ultimate anti-establishment candidate â€”  added a critical sense of credibility to the businessman's candidacy. 
Christie's endorsement was quickly followed by the backing of Maine Gov. Paul LePage and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. 
Former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who has no plans to endorse a candidate in the GOP primary, said he was ""shocked"" by Christie's decision, and that the slew of new endorsements have irreversibly changed perceptions of Trump's candidacy.

""Trump is putting together a very unique coalition that's rattled a lot of people who have made a living out of trying to win within a Republican structure which is now increasingly obsolete,"" Gingrich said.  ""A lot of people smugly said when we get down to reality, he is not going to be the nominee because in the end people aren't going to vote for him. Well, guess what â€” he's almost certainly going to be the nominee.""
As Trump has started to pick up endorsements from serious conservative leaders including a handful of members of Congress, a fierce anti-Trump movement has started to pick up steam. 
Republican operatives, party leaders and conservative thinkers are increasingly warning that Trump is not a true conservative, and that his penchant for offensive language proves that he's an entertainer who should have no role shaping the future of the Republican Party. These rumblings turned into a movement on social media marked with the hashtag ""#NeverTrump"" -- a vow to never back Trump, even if he becomes the nominee. 
But these last-minute strategy sessions underscore the fundamental lack of a coordinated effort in the party to derail Trump's campaign. Many are simply resigned to accepting that this far along in the election, and considering the delegate math, no amount of money or anti-Trump messaging can slow the front-runner's momentum. 
Over the weekend, Trump only fueled the anger directed at his campaign when he failed to denounce white supremacist groups. 
Van Jones rips Donald Trump and the KKK
""I don't know anything about David Duke, OK?"" Trump told XXX 's Jake Tapper when asked whether he would disavow the Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, who is supporting Trump's campaign. Pressed several times, Trump insisted he didn't know anything about white supremacists. 

The interview unleashed fierce backlash. 
On Sunday evening, GOP Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse became the first member of Congress to join the #NeverTrump movement. If Trump wins the GOP nomination, Sasse said he would look for a third-party alternative. 
""I'm not going to vote for Hillary Clinton, and given what we know about Donald Trump, I can't vote for that guy either,"" the first-term senator said. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took Trump to task on Monday, saying Republicans must unequivocally reject racism. 
But the anti-Trump campaign is also angering some party elders. They say rejecting the GOP nominee is tantamount to handing the election to the eventual Democratic nominee, widely expected to be Hillary Clinton, who had a strong night on Super Tuesday. 
Former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson, who supported Jeb Bush's failed White House bid, told XXX that these rebelling Republicans may as well be casting their votes for Clinton. He also expressed deep frustration at the party for failing to rally around a single alternative to Trump, like Bush or Kasich, early enough in the election. 
""Just go ahead and support Hillary and forget it!"" said Simpson. ""They may not like Trump -- they didn't like Bush. What the hell was wrong with Bush? What the hell is wrong with Kasich?""
Gingrich, who pledged to back the party's eventual nominee, predicted that many of his fellow Republicans who now say they could never support Trump will eventually change their minds.  
""The absence of voting for the Republican nominee is functionally a vote for Hillary,"" Gingrich said. ""It's a crossroads for the Republican Party and it's a crossroads for America.""

GOP's Trump revolt: Too little too late?,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-gop-revolt/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 3:21:23,,"The aura of inevitability settling around Donald Trump's bid for the Republican presidential nomination is finally provoking what many of his GOP rivals have dreamed of for months: a sustained attack by party elders on the billionaire mogul.
Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who recently reemerged to predict ""a bombshell"" in Trump's tax returns, accused Trump Monday of ""coddling ... repugnant bigotry"" and called his failure to immediately condemn the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke ""repugnant & disgusting."" (Trump blamed a faulty earpiece; claiming he misunderstood the question from XXX 's Jake Tapper).
Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse vowed never to support Trump because of his ""relentless focus"" on ""dividing Americans."" John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, predicted that Trump would be ""an albatross around the down-ballot races."" Ken Mehlman, who ran George W. Bush's winning campaign in 2004, penned a Facebook post castigating Trump by stating that leaders shouldn't need to research whether to reject Klan support. ""They also don't mock people with disabilities, insult war heroes, divide people by religion and nationality, and insult women. #NeverTrump,"" Mehlman wrote.  
Everything changes March 1
The GOP revolt comes as Trump is poised to cruise toward victory in the Super Tuesday contests -- a crucial day in the nomination process when 595 delegates are up for grabs. But the question is whether the Republican outcry against Trump will have any real impact on voters as they head to the polls in more than a dozen states and territories, particularly as he racks up endorsements from key figures like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.

Allies close to Rubio and Cruz insist there is still time to defeat Trump -- a scenario that would involve winning their home states and pulling off strong results in other delegate-rich states in March. But in interviews, many GOP operatives acknowledged that scenario was highly unlikely, barring some huge upset on Tuesday night.
""When you look at operatives, donors, and the opinion elite, they are all scared to death that Trump is going to be the nominee,"" said Russ Schriefer, a senior adviser to Romney's 2012 campaign, as well as Christie's recent presidential bid. ""But then you look at voters and they are quite comfortable with Trump as the nominee... What you are now seeing is this full court anti-Trump press, but it's late,"" Schriefer said. ""Trump is no more dangerous than he was in August.""
""Tomorrow night, if we believe the polls, he's going to win everything but Texas,"" Schriefer said. ""If that were any other candidate, on Wednesday morning the party would be rallying around him or her.""
Steve Schmidt, a GOP strategist who ran John McCain's campaign in 2008, said the current Republican reaction to Trump's electoral strength ""depends where each individual Republican is in their stages of grief.""
2016 candidates matchmaker
""Some people remain in the anger and denial phase while others are moving to acceptance,"" Schmidt said. He pointed out that while there is a lot of ""loose talk"" about the congressional wing of the Republican Party protesting Trump's nomination, congressional approval on ""a good day"" hovers around 15%.   
""It's not as if there's a wave of good feeling around members of Congress or governors who all of a sudden are standing on principle in opposition to Trump's candidacy,"" Schmidt said. ""You see a lot of trend lines converging at this moment that have been buffeting the Republican Party for a long time.""
Schmidt added Trump's rise reflects the divergence nationally within the GOP in recent years about the true meaning of conservatism.
""Stepping into that vacuum are the candidates who are now tearing at the fabric of the old conservative coalition,"" he said.
At the same time that there was a sense of resignation within some GOP quarters about Trump's glide path to the nomination, a number of GOP strategists pointed out that the party allowed him to succeed in large part by failing to coalesce around an alternative candidate last fall.
Despite all the rumors of an anti-Trump movement last year in the form of super PAC campaign or other sustained attacks, nothing ever materialized. 
""You have to help somebody win, not just hope somebody else loses,"" said Mike DuHaime, a GOP strategist who most recently advised Christie, but also worked as a strategist for McCain, former President George W. Bush and Rudy Giuliani, among others.
""Most people who sat on the sidelines last year, now they are wringing their hands because they can't believe they got to this point. They could have all gotten behind one candidate,"" he said.

The final day of campaigning before Super Tuesday brought a preview of the fractious year ahead for Republicans.
There was an ugly confrontation at Trump's rally at Radford, Virginia, after protesters interrupted him when a Secret Service employee appeared to put a photographer in a choke hold and throw him down on a table. (It was unclear what led to the altercation, which the Secret Service was investigating).
A collection of white supremacist groups placed a fresh round of robocalls in support of Trump in at least one Super Tuesday state -- Vermont -- a tactic they adopted before the New Hampshire primary.
In a final push to stop Trump, Cruz once again questioned the authenticity of Trump's conservative credentials, citing an unsubstantiated report in BuzzFeed that Trump had taken a softer tone on immigration in an off-the-record interview with The New York Times editorial board.
But even the Texas Senator acknowledged to reporters that his chief rival would likely do well Tuesday.
""I believe after Super Tuesday, we will see this race become more and more a two-man race,"" Cruz said. ""Donald is going to come out with a whole bunch of delegates. I believe we're going to come out with a whole bunch of delegates. And I think everyone else will be way, way behind. If that's the case, then it is time for the party to unify. Head to head, I beat Donald Trump and I beat him resoundingly,"" Cruz said.
Rubio, for his part, ridiculed Trump for not distancing himself from Duke and other white supremacists: ""He's unelectable now; he refused to criticize the KKK,"" the Florida Senator said in Tennessee.
""You say, 'David Duke' to me, I say, 'racist' immediately,"" Rubio said later at an Atlanta rally. ""Why wouldn't he condemn the Ku Klux Klan? There is no room in the Republican Party for members of Ku Klux Klan or racists like David Duke.""

Appearing with Rubio on stage, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she would not ""stop until we fight a man who chooses not to disavow the KKK, that is not a part of our party, that is not who we want as president.""
Trump insisted during a Monday interview on NBC's ""Today"" that he had not heard the question about Duke and alleged that XXX gave him a faulty earpiece for his Sunday interview on ""State of the Union.""
""I don't mind disavowing David Duke,"" he said. ""I disavowed David Duke the day before at a press conference.""
Trump continued slinging insults toward Rubio and Cruz, calling Rubio a ""con man"" and a ""little guy,"" while charging that Cruz has ""done nothing for Texas."" 
DuHaime noted that Trump, should he win, faces a difficult task in uniting the party, but he also predicted that the party would enter a new phase once faced with the reality of the choices in the election.
""Most likely,"" DuHaime said, ""the great unifier will be Hillary Clinton."""
Haley response to Trump attack: 'Bless your heart',http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/nikki-haley-donald-trump-bless-your-heart/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 0:29:17,,"South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Tuesday brushed aside a series of attacks by Donald Trump and his top lieutenants with a quintessentially southern response.
""Bless your heart,"" the Palmetto State governor tweeted at Trump, brushing him back with some sharp-elbowed charm.
Haley, who endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio before South Carolina's February 20 primary -- which Trump won handily -- has ramped up her criticism of the billionaire front-runner ahead of the Super Tuesday contests.
On Tuesday afternoon, Trump retweeted critical posts from two aides, both seeking to spread a video that first shows Haley in 2012 dismissing as a ""distraction"" calls for then-GOP hopeful Mitt Romney to release his tax returns, before cutting to a more recent rally when she demanded Trump do just that.
""The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!"" Trump tweeted to cap it off, though not before deleting a first attempt that misspelled her name.
In January, Haley used a portion of her official Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address to needle Trump.
""During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,"" Haley said, never mentioning him by name. ""We must resist that temptation. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.""

Here's how far the remaining candidates are from their parties' nominations,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/super-tuesday-results-primary-delegate-race/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 19:54:04,,"Republicans and Democrats boosted the front-runners on Super Tuesday, sending Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton out to considerable leads in their respective nominating contests -- while carving out a stark view of the road ahead for the rest of the field.
On the GOP side, Trump led the pack with seven victories, while Ted Cruz picked up three, including his home state of Texas. Rubio scored his first win of the season, in the Minnesota caucuses.
With some Tuesday night allocations still outstanding, Trump now leads the Republican field with 332 delegates. Cruz, at 230, sits in distant second and Rubio's 113 are good for third. John Kasich has just 27 delegates and Ben Carson, who will no longer be actively campaigning, has seven. A majority of the 2,472 total delegates -- 1,237 -- is needed to win the nomination. Although the nominee is not officially selected until the delegates meet and vote at the Republican National Convention. Here's how the race could go:

There will be opportunities for the underdogs to shake up the race in the coming weeks.
March 15 is the first date to watch. Until now, states have split their delegates between all of the finishers who reach a certain threshold. But primaries in delegate-rich Ohio and Florida are winner-take-all, meaning even a narrow victory for Rubio in his home state would net him a potentially game-changing 99 delegates. Same for Kasich, the Ohio governor, who stands to add 66 delegates if he can win his Buckeye State. Those are big ifs, since Trump appears strong in recent polling in both states.
In April, New York's 95 delegates will be distributed proportionally, as will California's 172 when it votes on June 7. Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota will award a total of 107 delegates in winner-take-all primaries on the same day, the last one on the primary schedule.
But with Cruz and Rubio pledging to stay in the race for the long haul (Kasich has suggested he will drop out if he loses Ohio), Trump's path to the nomination is looking clearer with every passing contest. 

Meanwhile, the Democratic race is beginning to shape up like a rout. With the help of a heavy slate of superdelegate support, Clinton is nearly halfway to a clinching majority. She currently holds 1,055 delegates, 587 of them pledged. Sanders has 418, with 397 bound to back him.
Here's what their race -- to a 2,383 delegate majority-- looks like on Wednesday:
Sanders' path is especially narrow because the Democratic Party does not offer any winner-take-all or hybrid votes. Every contest awards its delegates proportionally, so the Vermont senator will need to score significant victories on March 15 in the delegate-heavy Florida, Illinois and Ohio contests if he hopes to upend Clinton. Sanders will also look to a glut of caucuses -- in which he has performed well -- at the end of March, especially one in Washington state, where more than 100 delegates are at stake. 
First up though, another round of voting this weekend, with Democratic contests on Saturday in Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska. Maine follows on Sunday.
Republicans will head to the polls in Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Maine on Saturday. Puerto Rico votes on Sunday.

Hillary Clinton: Over $30 million raised in February,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/hillary-clinton-fundraising-february/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 21:42:40,,"Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign raised $30 million in the month of February, the campaign announced Wednesday, less than what Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign brought in for the month.
Clinton's haul leaves the campaign with $31 million cash on hand, a sizable bank roll for a campaign that will have to spend heavily during March's primaries and caucuses.
""We continue to beat every fundraising goal and, more importantly, make smart and efficient investments,"" said Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager. ""Grassroots support is truly powering this campaign as the majority of our fundraising came from online donations.""
He added, ""That support has helped Hillary Clinton gain momentum by winning three out of four contests in February, and eight on Super Tuesday. We move forward with a commanding pledged delegate lead and the resources we need to run a competitive race.""
Sanders campaign announced Tuesday that they raised $42 million in the month of February, an impressive haul for a candidate whose bright spot in the campaign trail has been fundraising. The haul is the most a 2016 candidate has raised in a single month.
RELATED: Bernie Sanders: Prolific Democratic Party fundraiser
Six million of that haul came on February 29, the final day of the month. Sanders' campaign made a concerted push to break $40 million haul.
""Working Americans chipping in a few dollars every week are changing the way campaigns in our country are financed,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""Not only are we going to smash Secretary Clinton's personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination.""
Sanders campaign spent heavily in January. Though he outraised Clinton in January, Sanders ended the month with $14.7 million in the bank. The Sanders campaign has yet to announce their cash on hand total for the month of February.
The former secretary of state's campaign, through the Hillary Victory Fund, also raised $4.4 million for the Democratic National Committee and state parties.

Hillary Clinton wins tennis match while GOP keeps mud wrestling (Opinion),http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/opinions/hillary-clinton-victory-super-tuesday-brazile/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 3:23:47,,"With all the drama and tragicomedy in the Republican primary, it's a little hard to get people to pay attention to what is going on in the Democratic side. But even though they are going about it in a much less sensational way, the Democrats are also choosing a candidate who is just as likely to be the next president of the United States; some would say more likely, given the current state of affairs.
 
The dysfunctional GOP race may be unfolding like a dream for journalists, pundits and political junkies, but meanwhile the Democratic primaries are unfolding exactly like a primary season is supposed to unfold.
 
A well-positioned front-runner is being challenged by an insurgent candidate who is running a campaign based on ideology, not hubris. Even if Sen. Bernie Sanders does not accrue enough delegates in the Super Tuesday sweepstakes, his candidacy has helped define the agenda, moved both the party and the front-runner to embrace serious proposals to help level the economic playing field, and energized a significant portion of the Democratic base.
 
Despite Sanders' success overall, this Super Tuesday was â€” as expected â€” a huge night for Hillary Clinton. Clinton won at least six states and will likely pick up delegates in states that Sanders carried like Oklahoma.
 
Clinton hasn't locked up the nomination, but she is locked into a groove that should get her there, barring any unforeseen circumstances. The demographics of Super Tuesday favored Clinton. 
The night was rich in states with large diverse populations including African-American populations in states like Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and Arkansas, and once more they came through for her in truly impressive numbers. She did well in more states than Sanders, and the states she did well in were the larger states. From here on out it will be a matter of steadily accumulating delegates, more than winning states.
 
And although Super Tuesday was significantly less than super for Bernie Sanders, things could improve for him going forward. The upcoming states have more of the white liberal voters who have flocked to him. And Sanders' fundraising has been by far the best of any candidate, meaning that he will have plenty of money as long as he can keep winning enough delegates to deny Clinton a clinch of the nomination. But it remains to be seen if Sanders' big Super Tuesday losses will make voters question his electability.
 
Both Hillary and Bernie would do well to ignore the raucous action taking place in the Republican race and focus on winning the hearts and minds of Democrats (while of course having their strategists making detailed plans for any contingency regarding the outcome in the GOP). 
 
The sound and fury of the Donald Trump phenomenon have excited the Republican base, leading to record turnout in virtually every state. Meanwhile, Democratic turnout is well below the numbers from 2008.
 
Part of that is the relative lack of spectacle: The Democratic race has been quite polite compared to the Republican contest, but then most hockey fights are quite polite compared to this Republican contest. Still, the Democratic nominee will have to close the enthusiasm gap, and they can best do that by not pivoting too soon, and concentrating on Democratic voters for now.

Hill Republicans walk tight line on Trump,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/donald-trump-hill-republicans/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 4:37:49,,"Congressional Republican leaders publicly rebuked Donald Trump on Tuesday for not quickly and firmly condemning the Ku Klux Klan in a recent XXX interview. But on the eve of Super Tuesday wins for Trump, those same leaders and most rank-and-file Republicans on Capitol Hill were careful about totally severing ties with the billionaire businessman, who is attracting support across a wide range of voters.
House Speaker Paul Ryan blasted Trump's handling of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke's support, telling reporters Tuesday, ""If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on people's prejudices.""
But when pressed if that meant he would oppose Trump if he became the nominee, Ryan repeated a line delivered by many Republican lawmakers around the Capitol recently: ""My plan is to support the nominee.""
Trump's dominance in the Republican primaries is wreaking havoc for many Republican lawmakers -- especially those up for re-election -- who may want to distance themselves from the trash-talking reality show star, but who are afraid it will turn off the voters who are showing up at the polls in record high numbers to vote for Trump.
RELATED: Super Tuesday 2016 results
Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who told XXX Monday that he worried Trump could be an ""albatross"" around down-ballot candidates, said Tuesday that candidates should do what they need to do to distance themselves from any controversy that could hurt their chances this fall.
""I think no matter who is elected president of the United States in November, it's important we maintain the Republican majority in the United States Senate. The Supreme Court vacancy, if nothing else, ought to cause people to reach that conclusion, so whatever people need to do in their individual races on order to maintain that majority, I wholeheartedly support,"" Cornyn said.
Democrats are confident Republican congressional candidates will be forced to deal with the ""baggage"" Trump or one of the other GOP presidential contenders would bring with them, said Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who heads the Senate Democrats' campaign organization.
""Whoever they nominate, if they're going to be out of the mainstream, which obviously he is, it puts them in a bind,"" Tester said.
Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, who is up for re-election, told reporters, ""I'll support the ticket and I'm not endorsing anyone."" But he declined to weigh in on questions about Trump, saying, ""I'm not going to talk about it any further than that,"" quipping on his way into a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans, ""I'm going in here because if I don't say something stupid to these questions, I might win.""
The third-ranking Republican senator, John Thune of South Dakota, who also is running for a new term, predicted there could be more splits from the GOP front-runner. 
""There are going to be times that you're not going to agree with the person that's leading your party"" and ""that's always the case and I don't think this year will be any different,"" Thune said.
""I intend to support the nominee. I've said that from the very beginning,"" said Thune, who said he would like Trump to ""clarify"" his KKK comments.
Trump, however, suggested Tuesday night that he would ""get along great with Congress"" -- but that he would pursue his agenda regardless of whether he had their support.
""Paul Ryan, I don't know him well, but I'm sure I'm going to get along great with him,"" Trump said. ""But if I don't, he's going to have to pay a big price, OK?"" Trump said in a victory speech.

A small group of Republican senators -- notably none of whom are up for re-election this year -- were especially critical of Trump on Tuesday.
""It's not hard to denounce the KKK. That does not take any thought whatsoever,"" said Maine Sen. Susan Collins.
""It would be very difficult to support Donald Trump,"" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona.
""It's a concern to have Trump on the top of the ticket. It's a concern for anyone on the ballot,"" Flake said. ""Some of us feel we have a responsibility to speak out when he makes outlandish, crazy statements like the Muslim ban or a number of others.""
""I don't believe Trump supports the KKK or is a racist, I just think he's playing politics in a very clever fashion and he's going to get burned here,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who also sought the Republican nomination for president before dropping out. ""Maybe someone told him you don't need to go there, you may lose a few votes, and he tried to recalculate.""
Graham said he thinks voters will be fair and won't hold Republican Senate candidates -- like his friend John McCain, who is running for re-election in Arizona -- accountable for Trump's controversial statements and positions. 
Freshman Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska has been the most critical of Trump of any GOP senator. He said candidates for the House and Senate have to ""run to win your election.""
""The only thing you can do is control the things you can control. And so our candidates are raising money, they're organizing, they're carrying their own message in their own states and they're going to have to put together a winning campaign there irrespective of what happens on the national ticket,"" he said.
Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who backs Sen. Marco Rubio for president, reiterated his position that he would back whoever the Republican nominee is.
Hatch downplayed any fallout for GOP candidates potentially running on the same ticket as Trump because congressional candidates can speak out and differentiate their position.
""I think it's up to us to make it clear that we don't tolerate those types of racist organizations and I don't know many people who would believe that we do. I think deep down, I don't think Donald Trump tolerates it either. I think he is just inexperienced in expressing himself at things like that.""

Sen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, told reporters he would back whoever the GOP nominates for president, but when pressed about Trump, joked, ""I'm working on Tom Selleck to get in the race.""
Asked if he had concerns about Trump's recent comments, Roberts, a Rubio supporter, responded, ""which ones?""
Hatch said it's inevitable that Republicans will have to answer questions about any controversial comments from the front-runner in their party, but referring to Trump, he said, ""he does make more than the average person, put it that way.""
Rep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, was pushing for Rubio and Cruz to come up with a unity ticket to counter Trump. But on Tuesday he said his party faces a ""mathematical problem rather than a political problem, and a divided conservative base may be overwhelmed by those who are looking at the bright political shiny object that has anything but a conservative record.""
Franks said he would face an ""impossible conundrum"" if Trump wins the nomination, but told reporters he would vote for him if he is the candidate facing Hillary Clinton in November.

Making history: Clinton and Trump blaze trails,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/super-tuesday-history-was-made-gergen/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 13:55:10,,"Even as we in the commentariat dig into the entrails of Super Tuesday voting  -- for example, asking how many left-handed, 24-year-old Lutherans caucused in Minnesota and how they voted -- we should not overlook the larger significance of this year's pivotal moment.
We witnessed history in the making this Super Tuesday: For the first time in the American story, a woman nearly wrapped up the presidential nomination of a major political party, and on the other side, a total renegade came close to clinching the presidential nomination of the opposing party. Historians will long remember these days.  
Bernie Sanders still has a mathematical possibility of wresting the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton, of course, but her victories in seven states Tuesday has made his path incredibly steep. Sanders' best reason for going forward in other states is not to win the crown but to gain ever greater influence for the Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party.  
The close parallels between Clinton's victory speech and his on Tuesday night illustrated just how much he has already brought her in his direction; think now of how much bargaining power he may eventually exercise over the Democratic platform and convention.
But among most Democrats, the night truly belonged to Clinton. After a stumbling start to her campaign in Iowa and especially New Hampshire, she has won a series of stunningly large victories -- by a dozen points or more -- that are truly impressive. Win or lose in November, Clinton is now leaving footprints in the sand for generations of future women.  
On the other side, Donald Trump on Super Tuesday won a series of convincing victories that have brought him closer to winning the nomination of his party than any business leader since Wendell Willkie. That was in 1940 when Willkie stormed the Republican convention; he went on to lose to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the general but was well-remembered for the bipartisan help he gave to FDR as war came.
No business leader has captured the imagination of voters since. Mitt Romney was a CEO, too, but he won the GOP nomination in 2012 because he had been a successful governor, not because of his corporate experience. Indeed, his corporate leadership was a matter of controversy rather than strength.
Even Willkie was no Trump -- he was chief of a utilities company, which is akin to running as an accountant. Trump is the exact opposite, gleefully breaking all conventionalities with his bombast, narcissism and seeming indifference to the intricacies of running a powerful, complex government. 
Yet here is Trump with 10 victories in the first 15 states to vote. It remains hard to imagine him as the nominee of the Republican Party, but it is even harder to see who will beat him now. Historians may one day ask who has shaped the political landscape of America more: the first woman nominee of a party or the first celebrity CEO to seize the reins of a party.  
Clinton and Trump haven't won their crowns yet, but after Super Tuesday, they should certainly feel the weight of responsibility bearing down upon them. And one hopes that in their quiet moments, they are examining their souls and asking not only how they can make history -- but more importantly, how they can bend its arc toward a better world.

"NASCAR CEO, drivers endorse Donald Trump",http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-nascar-endorsements/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 1:03:07,,"NASCAR's chief executive and several NASCAR drivers endorsed Donald Trump on Monday, just one day before a cluster of Southern states vote in the GOP's Super Tuesday contests.
Brian France, the racing association's CEO, appeared Monday alongside Trump during a rally at Valdosta State University, touting the Republican front-runner's success in his business and personal life.
""You know about his winning in business and success. I'm gonna tell you, he wins with his family,"" said France, who noted that he's known Trump for more than two decades.
""That's how I judge a winner,"" France added, pointing to how well Trump's children have turned out.
The endorsement marked a stark contrast with how NASCAR reacted to Trump's controversial comments this summer about undocumented Mexican immigrants -- calling them criminals and ""rapists"" -- when the racing association decided to change the location for its postseason banquet away from the Trump National Doral and to another venue.  
Bill Elliott, a retired champion NASCAR driver, also joined Trump on stage, saying that he's ""all for"" what Trump has said he will do for the United States as president.
""For what he can do I think for our country, I'm all for it. We need a change guys, that's all there is to it,"" Elliott said.
Elliott's son and two other current NASCAR drivers also endorsed Trump Monday.
The endorsements could give Trump a boost Tuesday, when more than a dozen states, including several southern states like Georgia, where NASCAR is especially popular, make their choice for Republican nominee known.
NASCAR's 2015 season averaged 5.1 million viewers, according to the ESPN-owned Jayski.com website.
Thanking his latest endorsers, Trump noted that ""they have guts.""
Moments earlier, Trump opened his rally praising the stock car racing association.
""I love NASCAR. Do we love NASCAR?"" Trump asked the crowd.
The endorsement comes on the heels of a series of high-profile endorsements for the billionaire Republican presidential candidate who is increasingly viewed as most likely to become his party's nominee.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions have also endorsed Trump in the final days of campaigning leading up to the crucial Super Tuesday contests.

Political Prediction Market: What are Clinton and Trump's odds?,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/political-prediction-market-super-tuesday/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 20:45:32,,"With voters heading to the polls and to caucus in 12 states across the country, Pivit has been monitoring the Political Prediction Market, which is powered by the predictions of 100,000 users in conjunction with publicly available polling and real-money wagering market data, to assess the 2016 field.
 
Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump hold substantial leads in nearly all of the Super Tuesday primary markets.  Both candidates are expected to rack up major victories, according to the prediction market, and add to their delegate counts. But there are also some deeper insights  in the prediction market data:  

Hillary Clinton is currently at 95% to win the Democratic nomination -- her highest odds to date. Does this make her inevitable? There appears no clear path for Bernie Sanders to claim the nomination, at least according to the data on the market. Even if Sanders wins the Massachusetts primary on Tuesday - he currently has 27% odds -- he likely would not break 10% odds to win the nomination. The silver lining states for Sanders: Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont.  Sanders is at 99% to win the Vermont primary, and has seen marked gains in Oklahoma primary market.  Sanders finds himself at 47% odds to win in Oklahoma as of this afternoon -- that's up 33% over the past two days.
 
But even if he wins in Oklahoma and Vermont, it won't be enough for him to make gains in the hunt for the nomination.  If the Super Tuesday market odds hold, we expect Clinton's odds to win the nomination to hit 98% by the end of the night.
 

Donald Trump has pulled way ahead of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz following his increasingly big wins in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.  Trump is now at 80% odds to win the GOP nomination, with Rubio and Cruz trailing at 16% and 2%, respectively.  
 
Additionally, Trump leads all Super Tuesday primary markets (except for Texas) with an average of 80-90% odds to win.  
 
Rubio's last hope:  One possible way forward for Rubio would be for him to win delegates in the Texas primary -- he needs to get 20% of the vote total - and breathe life into a potential upset in the Florida primary on March 15.  
 
But even that path is a tough one for the Florida senator.  
In Texas, Cruz holds a major lead to win his home state -- at 81% odds.  Trump is at 19%. If both Rubio and Cruz manage to walk away with delegates tonight from the Lone Star State, then Florida becomes key.
The Florida primary market currently shows Trump withy 91% odds to win, and Rubio trailing with 8% odds. It will take a Herculean effort to put Florida in play for Rubio, and that effort starts tonight in Texas.
 
Cruz's last hope: While he is the favorite to win in Texas, according to the prediction market data, Cruz does not have strong odds to win the nomination. But if Rubio doesn't win any delegates in the TX primary, Cruz could come out with the lead in delegate count; some in the political class say that arguably gives him a proxy to challenge Trump.
 

The most volatile markets right now are:
Trump to Win TX Primary
Sanders to Win MA Primary
Cruz to Win AR Primary.
Volatile markets are a canary in the coal mine for potential upsets;  we'll be watching these markets in particular as polls close to see if Trump, Sanders or Cruz can pull off the win.
 

Assuming there are no surprises in any of the bevy of states holding contests tonight, we'll end the night with voters focused on a likely matchup of Clinton and Trump in the general election.  Pivit has been tracking the odds for the current slate of candidates to win the Presidency, and Clinton holds the lead.
 
Clinton is at 63% odds to win the Presidency, with Trump a distant second at 27%.  
 
Looking at it from the Democratic vs. Republican perspective, the Democrats are trading at 63% odds to win the Presidency, with Republicans at 37% odds.

"R.I.P. religious right, and other Super Tuesday takeaways",http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/religion-super-tuesday/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 17:35:24,,"Was it a coming-out party for atheists or a funeral dirge for the religious right?  
In an election year full of twists, Super Tuesday didn't disappoint. Voters in 12 states went to the polls, handing victories to the GOP's Donald Trump and Democrats' Hillary Clinton. 
Exit polls can't tell us everything about Tuesday. They didn't plumb the depth of religious commitment among Trump's evangelical flock, or measure the size of the ""God gap"" between supporters of Bernie Sanders and Clinton.
But in broad strokes, the exit polls paint a picture of a radically shifting religious landscape.
With that in mind, here are four big takeaways from Super Tuesday.

For years, journalists have been writing the religious right's obituary, only to see the movement rise from the grave during general elections and rally behind the GOP's presidential candidate.
But the religious right has never seen a hammer quite like Trump, and on Super Tuesday he finally nailed the coffin shut. 
In the days before Super Tuesday, conservative Christian leaders cautioned, cajoled and pleaded with evangelicals to reject Trump, saying the New York businessman epitomized the opposite of their values. 
Tuesday was supposed to be the religious right's last stand, a day when the Bible Belt would enter the voting booth and christen the most God-fearing candidate. Christian conservatives were the last best hope to halt Trump's momentum. 
They didn't.  
According to exit polls, Trump won a plurality of evangelical and born-again Christians in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. 
In several states, even evangelicals who said that it's important for a candidate to share their religious values voted for Trump. That's a direct repudiation of the message Christian leaders have been shouting from the rooftops: The thrice-married mogul more at home in casinos than churches is not one of us!  
""Religious right R.I.P,"" Mark Silk, a professor of religion and public life at Trinity College, wrote on Wednesday morning.  
The movement died of ""natural causes,"" Silk said. Its founding leaders, like the Rev. Jerry Falwell, have died or retired; its organizational weight has withered; its crusades, such as the push against same-sex marriage, appear to be lost causes. 
But the religious right's fatal wounds were self-inflicted, said David Campbell, an expert on religion and politics at the University of Notre Dame. 
""The religious right is reaping what they have sown: By drawing religious people into politics, people began to put their political preferences ahead of their religious values."" 

In the days before Super Tuesday, Hillary Clinton spent a lot of time in churches. Last Sunday alone, she attended two services in Memphis, where she preached about ""love and kindness."" 
It was a smart strategy in the South, where many voters, particularly African-Americans, are deeply devout. And it appears to have worked. 
In Alabama, 92% of people who said they attend religious services more than once a week voted for Clinton. In Georgia, more than 80% of frequent worshippers broke for her. Those numbers also held in Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Clinton won all of those states. 

When political scientists talk about a ""God gap"" in American politics, they often mean the religious gulf between Christian conservatives and liberal Democrats. 
In 2016, though, a sizable ""God gap"" has appeared within the Democratic Party itself. 
As noted above, Clinton has cleaned up among the devoutly religious, not only on Super Tuesday but also in South Carolina in February. 
Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, appears to be drawing deep support from people who rarely step foot inside a house of prayer. 
Sanders attracted a majority of voters who don't regularly attend worship services in Arkansas and Texas, and came close (46%) in Virginia, helping him win delegates even where he lost states. 
The four states that Sanders did win -- Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont -- all have one thing in common: a large number of religiously unaffiliated voters, or ""nones."" 
We don't have exit poll data on voters' religion in those states, but other polls suggest religious skeptics are breaking for Sanders. 

Super Tuesday was supposed to be Ted Cruz's ""Southern firewall,"" when evangelicals in the Bible Belt would come out in droves to support one of their own. That plan seemed successful in Texas, Cruz's home state, and neighboring Oklahoma. 
But Cruz was badly beaten by Trump among evangelicals in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia. (Exit polls show a virtual tie in Arkansas.) In those states, Trump bested Cruz among voters who said it's important that a candidate shares their Christian values, evidence that the Texas senator has failed to forge an emotional connection with evangelicals.
Perhaps the main problem is that, from the first days of his campaign, the most dramatic religious conversion story Cruz has told Christians isn't about himself; it's about his father, Rafael. 
In other words, Cruz may have a ""testimony problem.""

Romney wants a word about the race,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/mitt-romney-to-speak-on-state-of-the-2016-presidential-race-thursday/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 18:31:06,,"Mitt Romney will speak Thursday on ""the state of the 2016 presidential race,"" he said in a press release.
The 2012 Republican nominee will speak at 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday at the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics Forum, the same day that the remaining GOP presidential candidates are schedule to debate in Detroit. 
Romney's remarks come at a time of deep soul-searching for the Republican establishment as they consider ways to take on front-runner Donald Trump, who dominated yesterday's Super Tuesday contests. 
In Washington, Utah's Sen. Orrin Hatch told XXX ""If the convention is locked up, there's a possibility"" Romney would run for president. 
Romney has been especially vocal in criticizing Trump in recent days, raising the possibility that the billionaire's tax returns could contain a ""bombshell"" and slamming him for not disavowing white supremacists in an interview Sunday with XXX 's Jake Tapper.
Trump later said he'd had a faulty earpiece, and noted he'd condemned former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke -- who Tapper had asked about -- both before and after that interview.
Still, Romney hit him on Twitter the following day, saying: ""A disqualifying & disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America."" 
New York Rep. Peter King told XXX he wasn't aware of any ""inside information"" related to what Romney will say at Thursday's speech but did express concern over Trump's momentum in the presidential race.
""His whole campaign is all based around Donald Trump and his personality,"" King, who has endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said, adding that he plans to be at the Republican convention this summer. "
Ron Paul blasts state of 2016 race,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/election-center-2016/ron-paul-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-2016-race/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 17:57:18,,"Former Republican presidential candidate and libertarian champion Ron Paul lamented the state of the 2016 race on Tuesday. 
""My biggest beef is that from a libertarian view point, there is no meaningful difference between (Hillary Clinton) and (Donald Trump). I mean they both support the military industrial complex, the federal reserve, deficits and entitlements, and and an invasion of our privacy,"" Paul told XXX's Carol Costello on ""Newsroom."" ""It's super nationalistic populism versus socialism.""
The former Texas congressman's comments come as voters flock to the polls in Super Tuesday states. According to a recent XXX/ORC national poll, Trump leads to the Republican race with 49% support, while Clinton tops Democratic rival Bernie Sanders 55% to 38%.
Paul also likened Trump to Sanders, saying they are both ""authoritarian."" 
""He's a big voter for militarism, but had one vote he could brag about,"" Paul said describing Sanders and his vote against the Iraq War. ""He's an authoritarian of a different color, but Trump is a super authoritarian."" 
Paul also blasted Trump for refusing to disavow an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke. 
""That's unbelievable to me,"" Paul said. ""They're evil, they're monsters ... yet this is going to be the issue of the day."" 
Trump is under fire from Republicans and Democrats for not formally disavowing the Ku Klux Klan during an interview with XXX's Jake Tapper on Sunday's ""State of the Union."" He has since done so several times.
Paul told Costello he has no plans to endorse anyone in the race. His son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, suspended his campaign in February. 
"
Some see strategy in Trump's comments on race,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-kkk-super-tuesday/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 1:00:08,,"As Republican candidates and top GOP officials spent a second day condemning -- and sitting in disbelief -- of Donald Trump's decision Sunday to decline repeated invitations to disavow the Ku Klux Klan, there are more than a few that think it's a bald strategic play by the billionaire businessman.
Trump's comments coming so close to Super Tuesday, a primary day littered with contests across the deep South, rang alarm bells for some Republicans who saw them as an intentional dog whistle. 
""As the guy who is positioning himself as the smartest guy in politics, he sure plays dumb a lot,"" says Doug Heye, a veteran Republican operative who announced in January he wouldn't support Trump if he was the Republican nominee. 
Heye's position has since caught fire in recent days, as the ""#NeverTrump"" movement has spread across Twitter, with top conservatives, including Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, have pledged not to support the nominee. 
Trump's history during the primary on inflammatory race issues is one of the top reasons many give for their refusal to support his candidacy. Yet Trump, while never openly courting the fringe groups, has nonetheless garnered their support through his immigration policy proposals and bellicose rhetoric.  
In the day since his interview with XXX's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" Trump has disavowed David Duke, the former KKK Grand Wizard, supporting his campaign. He blamed his refusal to do so Sunday on a bad earpiece, even as he repeated Duke's name multiple times back to Tapper. 

But it's more than the most recent dust-up that has some convinced Trump's actions -- or lack thereof -- are intentional. 
""Don't tell me he doesn't know who the KKK is,"" Marco Rubio said at a rally Monday. ""We cannot be the party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.""
Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, accused Trump of participating in the ""coddling of repugnant bigotry."" 
""It's clearly intentional,"" said an operative for a rival campaign, who asked for anonymity to discuss the subject without their candidate's permission. ""And it's just so blatant."" 
The same operative pointed to Trump's 2000 interview where with NBC's Matt Lauer where Trump called Duke ""a bigot, a racist, a problem."" 
""What on earth changed in 16 years? The electoral map, I guess,"" the operative said.
On Monday, Trump said in an interview with NBC's ""Today Show"" he didn't ""mind disavowing anyone. I disavowed Duke the day before at a major news conference.""

For Trump, the support of white supremacists is not a new element of his campaign, but he has never touted associations with the groups or in any way publicly courted their support. Yet his tweets, public comments and answers -- or, in many non-answers -- to questions about the groups have at times served to legitimize efforts of such groups that support him. 
In the days before the New Hampshire primary, robocalls touting Trump's campaign were funded by a super PAC affiliated organized by a group, the American Freedom Party, which says it ""shares the customs and heritage of the European American people."" 
Trump's campaign said at the time the candidate ""has disavowed all Super PACs offering their support and continues to do so."" 

Perhaps most notably, any flap related to race -- and there have been plenty -- seems to either bounce off Trump or only galvanize his support. He carries large leads in many of the so-called SEC primary states into Super Tuesday and a new nationwide XXX/ORC survey finds Trump's lead is dominant, and his support tops that of his four remaining opponents combined.
For Republicans like Heye though, the most recent dust-up only serves to raise further concern about the direction a Trump-led GOP, which has grown increasingly more likely in recent weeks, would head.  
""It picks at what's been a very, very bad scab for Republicans for a long time,"" Heye said. ""I think the party if they nominate him will be committing an abortion on itself.""

Super PAC pitches GOP donors on plan to stop Trump,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/republican-donald-trump-super-pac-call/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 2:44:01,,"Washington (CNN)Katie Packer, the Republican operative leading the anti-Donald Trump super PAC, pitched her strategy to stop the Republican front-runner on a call with more than 50 GOP donors and power brokers Tuesday, including those with ties to the campaigns of Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Chris Christie. 
Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, who was Chris Christie's national finance co-chair, and Brian Baker, a Republican operative connected to the Ricketts family, both spoke on the call, sources who were on the call told XXX. 
READ: HP chief Meg Whitman calls Trump 'unfit to be president'
It came on Super Tuesday, as Trump prepared to build on his lead -- and Republican loyalists increasingly fretted the prospect that Trump will run away with the nomination.   
Packer, a veteran of Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign who launched Our Principles PAC, told XXX that ""it concerns me"" that Super Tuesday's results might not make her task any easier by knocking any Republicans out of the field.
But, she added, ""if the worst-case scenario is we have to take it all the way to the convention, that's fine by me.""
Still, it's not clear that establishment Republicans have settled on a single strategy to defeat Trump -- a reality Packer acknowledged. 
""The question is, do people feel like that's best executed by giving to a campaign that they're invested in or another candidate's super PAC or our effort?"" Packer said. ""We're not particularly greedy about it coming to our effort, although we have had a lot of enthusiasm for our effort.""
Packer argued that Trump has not faced a sustained negative advertising campaign. She pointed out that so far, of the $215 million spent on the air in the GOP race, only $9 million has been funneled into attack ads against Trump -- less than the $10 million Romney's campaign spent in a single week in a single state, Florida, to undercut Newt Gingrich in 2012.
""The reality is that there has been no sustained campaign against this guy until last Thursday,"" she said.
The new push comes after the group aired ads against Trump in Iowa, but couldn't raise money to continue after Trump's second-place finish there.
Packer's super PAC also ramped up its efforts this week by hiring ex-Jeb Bush campaign aide Tim Miller as its communications director. 
The group is already on the air nationally with an ad that launched Tuesday blasting ""Trump University."" It's airing on XXX and Fox News, as well as more broadly in Florida, Illinois and Michigan -- three key states that vote later this month.
The attacks on Trump could sound like the 2012 hits on Romney's work at Bain Capital. 
Previewing her line of attack against Trump, Packer said: ""This guy isn't a conservative. He probably isn't even a Republican. He is a con man who is incredibly vulnerable in the general election once Democrats get their hands on him.""

Super Tuesday: How much each vote cost the candidates,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/super-tuesday-cost-of-votes/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 14:08:15,,"Super Tuesday is wrapped, and the votes are tallied. Here's a look at what each vote cost each candidate.
Cost estimates come from CMAG/Kantar Media and represent spending on TV advertising in Super Tuesday states from January 1, 2015 to March 2, 2016.

You can't buy much for 15 cents these days -- unless you're Ben Carson. 
As the race for the Republican nomination went national on Super Tuesday, the former neurosurgeon turned out to be the best bargain hunter in the race. He spent a mere $75,000 on TV advertising in the states holding caucuses and primaries on Tuesday, but still managed to garner 489,588 votes, for an average cost of 15 cents per vote.
Of course, Carson is barely figuring in the actual nomination battle.
The night's big winner was Donald Trump, and he continues to rake in victories on the cheap -- boosted by jaw-dropping amounts of free media. He spent about $2.1 million across the Super Tuesday states and racked up 2,923,184 votes, for a budget-conscious 72 cents per vote.
The two men fighting to be the alternative to Trump poured a lot more cash into the race, with less to show for it. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and his PAC allies spent $9.9 million to win 1,867,264 votes, for a generous $5.30 per vote. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and supporters shelled out $9.8 million and got 2,483,553 votes. That works out to $3.95 per vote.
And finally, Ohio Gov. John Kasich continues to be hoping for a landscape shift that will help make him the nominee. If he does manage it, he'll have done it on the cheap. He and his allies spent $320,000 on Super Tuesday advertising and took 538,996 votes, for an average cost of 59 cents per vote.

On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the winner, not only in the number of states and votes she won, but in cost per vote. She and her allies spent about $7.83 million across the Super Tuesday states, and she captured 3,534,665 votes. That's $2.16 per vote.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders spent slightly less -- $6.1 million -- and took 2,264,165 votes, for a cost of $2.69 per vote.

Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio need strong turnouts to show they can fight Trump over the long-term. And Bernie Sanders hopes to stem Clinton's momentum with a few wins of his own.
Voters of both parties in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia go the polls or caucus Tuesday. Democrats also caucus in Colorado and Republicans will do the same in Alaska.
Here's what to watch on the biggest day yet in the 2016 race: 

Trump is cruising nationally -- with 49% support compared to Rubio's 16% and Cruz's 15% in a new XXX/ORC poll, giving him his largest lead yet. 
He's likely to blow out the competition in Massachusetts, Tennessee and Alabama, polls there show. 
But it's also possible Trump could win all 11 states -- or come close to it. And if he does, it would leave other Republicans with very little hope of catching up.

Cruz has raised his decades-old ties to mafia bosses who controlled New York's construction industry and prodded Trump to reveal what he told The New York Times in an off-the-record conversation about immigration. Rubio has hammered Trump as a ""con artist,"" pointing to his hiring of undocumented immigrants on construction projects and his namesake university. And Trump ran into trouble when he failed to disavow the KKK and white supremacist David Duke to XXX's Jake Tapper. 
If Trump runs the table on Super Tuesday, or comes close, it'll be yet more proof that attacks and insults -- true or not; subtle or direct -- only make him stronger. 
It'll also leave him with a massive delegate lead and a weakened crop of competitors. 

He hasn't been shy about it: Ted Cruz says Super Tuesday is ""the most important day in the entire election."" 
After days of relentlessly building expectations, the pressure is now on the Texas senator to perform.
The first big question: Does he win Texas -- and by a big margin? If Cruz loses his home state, it will be both embarrassing and mean he's in for a very though night nationwide, leaving him with no path forward in the campaign. 
The second big question: Does he win anywhere else? 
Cruz's strategy of racking up Southern and evangelical votes has been wrecked by Trump. Now, Cruz is trying to win delegates wherever he can. Four states could represent Cruz's best hopes: Oklahoma and Arkansas, his two neighboring states; Alaska, with its libertarian streak; and Georgia, a delegate-rich state that all three leading contenders see as in play. 
He's also looking over his shoulder at Rubio. If Cruz wins Texas and at least one more state, and Rubio doesn't notch any Super Tuesday victories at all, it would put the Texas senator in much better position to argue that he is the true Trump alternative in the field. 

Rubio captured second place over Cruz in South Carolina. Then he consolidated the GOP establishment's support after elbowing Jeb Bush out of the race. Then he unleashed the most vicious attack on Trump of any candidate yet, in person, on the debate stage last Thursday and continued his barrage of insults over the weekend â€” including some Trump-level personal zingers.
Now, he needs wins. 
For all the hype his campaign has received in recent days, Rubio has gone 0-for-4 in the early states -- and unlike Cruz, whose home state votes, there are no locks on Tuesday's map. 
Rubio's best bet is probably Virginia, where the GOP establishment makes up much of the northern portion of the state.

He also hopes to compete in Georgia, where he could win in the Atlanta suburbs. Rubio campaigned there Monday alongside South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a particularly effective surrogate. 
But a nightmare scenario for the Florida senator and his backers is an 0-for-11 night, coupled with Cruz notching more than one victory. That would continue the race's status quo -- with Trump as the commanding front-runner and the rest of the party's electorate split between the two freshman senators.
Rubio won't be leaving the race anytime soon, no matter what happens Tuesday. He's got money, establishment backing and his home state of Florida votes on March 15. 
But his path is increasingly narrow. Ohio Gov. John Kasich remaining in the race complicates not just the Buckeye State -- another winner-take-all March 15 primary -- but other Great Lakes states like Michigan and Illinois, where Rubio also needs strong showings.

The lay of the Democratic land is pretty clear. 
Clinton, coming off a massive 48-point South Carolina blowout win, is likely to parlay her strength among minority voters into wins in Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas. 
Sanders, meanwhile, is targeting states that are whiter and, mostly, farther north: Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont. But only Vermont is a guaranteed win for him. If Clinton can carry her success in South Carolina across the rest of the South and pick off a couple of Sanders' targets, he'd be hard-pressed to catch her. 
And even if he locks them in, Clinton's stronger states outnumber his, nearly two to one, in the delegate count. 
Barring disaster, Clinton's delegate lead is certain to grow Tuesday. And given her long list of superdelegate endorsements, she could make it tough for Sanders to ever catch up. 
The real date Clinton and her supporters have circled on the calendar is March 15. It's when Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri all vote -- and when Clinton's backers hope they can land the knockout blow. 
She's already looking forward to the general election, taking on Trump in speeches while de-emphasizing attacks against Sanders. 
READ: Clinton to lay off Sanders a little ahead of Super Tuesday

Sanders is set to raise $40 million in February, according to the campaign, so he will be competitive for the foreseeable future. The problem is he needs to find new voters. 
His New Hampshire win and close call in Iowa came on the backs of white voters. But faced with a more diverse electorate in the past two races, he has faltered. Minority voters in Las Vegas helped Clinton win the caucuses there and the primary in South Carolina. 
Sanders has worked for months to reach out to minority voters -- particularly, in recent days, by portraying Republican attacks on President Barack Obama as racially motivated. But to keep the delegate count close, he'll have to succeed Tuesday where he failed just Saturday. 
It's an increasingly important challenge for Sanders. After Tuesday, the next major states to vote are Michigan, followed by five on March 15, all with significant minority populations.  
There are four key states to watch for Sanders on Tuesday. Wins in Colorado and Oklahoma could bode well for Sanders' ability to rack up delegates in more rural western states throughout the latter half of March and early April. A win in Minnesota is a good sign as Great Lakes states begin to vote. And a win in Massachusetts would underscore the strength of his support among liberals -- the types of people he hopes will eventually help him win California, and therefore, the nomination, on June 7.
But that's a very rosy scenario that doesn't look likely right now.

The backlash against Christie,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/chris-christie-donald-trump-backlash/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 16:21:47,,"They're calling Chris Christie ""an embarrassment."" 
An ""utter disgrace."" 
And they're calling for the New Jersey governor -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's most high-profile supporter -- to step down. 
The morning after Trump swept through Super Tuesday primaries, taking seven states and boasting that he will unify a Republican Party upended by his candidacy, Christie was ridiculed for his decision to support the real estate developer-turned-political force. 
Even before his positioning behind Trump during his victory speech spawned the hashtag #FreeChrisChristie, his endorsement drew a slew of irate hometown newspaper editorials that ran Tuesday.
""We're fed up with his opportunism, we're fed up with his hypocrisy,"" wrote six Gannett-owned newspapers, including the Asbury Park Press, the Cherry Hill Courier-Post and the Morristown Daily Record, in a joint editorial asking for Christie to quit or be recalled. 
""We're disgusted with his endorsement of Donald Trump after he spent months on the campaign trail trashing him, calling him unqualified by temperament and experience to be president,"" they wrote.
RELATED: Chris Christie steals Donald Trump's show
A Washington Post opinion writer said that Christie, once beloved as a straight-talker who got things done, had ruined his reputation. The New Hampshire Union-Leader declared that they'd been wrong to endorse him for governor. ""Rather than standing up to the bully, Christie bent on his knee,"" the New Hampshire-based paper wrote.  
And a poll conducted last week showed Christie's support among voters has slid from a lackluster 33% to a limp 27%. 
Christie pulled out of the presidential race on February 10 after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary. But after stepping out of the political ring, Christie endorsed Trump on February 26, declaring him the candidate most likely to beat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. 
Major political organizers and donors have chastised Christie, with his own national finance co-chair, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, summing it up as ""an astonishing display of political opportunism."" 
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a fellow Republican, told ABC on Sunday that ""none of us understand why he did this."" 
Former Republican New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman told the Newark Star-Ledger that she was ""ashamed"" Christie would endorse someone who has ""employed the kind of hate-mongering and racism that Trump has.""
Christie hasn't done himself any favors, trying to shut down reporters on Monday who wanted to ask questions about Trump's hesitation in disavowing an endorsement from white supremacist leader David Duke. 
""No, I won't permit you to"" ask questions about that, Christie said. 
Perhaps the most brutal excoriation has come online. 
News media and viewers alike took note of Christie's slack-jawed quizzical look as he stood behind Trump during the candidate's Super Tuesday speech in Florida. 
An MSNBC tweet said, ""caption this: What was on Chris Christie's mind during Trump's #SuperTuesday speech?""
""The Daily Show"" provided one answer, showing a series of screengrabs of Christie's odd expression with subtitles. ""What have I done?"" one reads. ""Dear God. What have I DONE?"" 
Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash tweeted his answer: ""it's staged to look like a hostage situation."" Soon enough, the hashtag #FreeChrisChristie was zinging through cyberspace.

The best of the Super Tuesday speeches,http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2016/03/02/best-of-super-tuesday-speeches-wrap-origwx-nws.cnn,cnn,3/2/2016 6:20:45,,
"Trump is huge, and he isn't going away",http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/super-tuesday-conservatives-stanley/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 5:33:46,,"Donald Trump won Super Tuesday. All other analysis feels like a distraction at this stage. 
He is ahead. He is the dominant candidate
Yet, despite this, the GOP continues to throw everything it's got at the front-runner. And continues to tear itself apart. It's become a kind of madness.
The Virginia primary result was a good illustration of the mood of the Republican Party. Here was a chance for Marco Rubio really to break through. He was doing well among late deciders. But as the evening wore on and the votes came in, it became obvious he wasn't going to do it. 
Rubio won the college educated, the overspill from Washington  and the wealthy. But Trump dominated among rural dwellers and in the suburbs. Some analysis says that John Kasich stole enough votes to deny Rubio the state, but why assume that all of Kasich's voters would've backed him?
By the time Virginia was called, one could feel the momentum drain away from Rubio -- even as he would go on to win one state: Minnesota. Will the energy ever come back? It's hard to see how or why. 
He's enjoyed every advantage: a week of great headlines, the support of the establishment, a consensus that he's the best placed to beat Hillary Clinton. Despite this, he failed to make his mark on Super Tuesday and is trailing Trump in his home state of Florida. 
And yet the only alternatives left in the race are John Kasich, with little appeal outside the North, and Ted Cruz, whom moderates broadly despise. The most rational thing to do right now might be for Kasich and Rubio to drop out and back Cruz -- the anti-Trump person who has won the most. And yet the most rational thing doesn't even seem to be on the table.
We know that the GOP is looking for answers. Insiders have tried to persuade others to drop out -- an approach that has been stymied by ego. How else to explain the absurd statement by Kasich's chief strategist that: ""Rubio's presence in the race is keeping Republicans from consolidating around Governor Kasich""? 
Other party bosses have started to raise money for an anti-Trump PAC; some are preparing for a brokered convention. Given that so many delegates are distributed proportionately, this is not a bad Plan B. 
Although it's hard to imagine that Rubio would be the main beneficiary, given that he did so badly in the primaries. Why crown a loser?
Most depressing, however, are the plans by congressional Republicans simply to break with Trump in the event of a general election. They've done the math. They've seen the polls that put Trump way behind Hillary Clinton and they know he could cost them dearly. Better, they think, to cauterize the nomination -- let Trump have the presidential ticket, cut him off and stop the poison contaminating them.
But the bigger, existential problem they face is that Trump's rise has told them things about their voters that they weren't ready to hear and don't know how to respond to. It is surely significant that so many have voted for a candidate who is willing to soften his words on Planned Parenthood, who thinks that the Iraq War was a huge mistake or who won't reform entitlements. 
On policy, Trumpism is often more moderate than orthodox conservatism. In tone, however, it is considerably cruder. This is old-fashioned populism: an economic platform that is intended to help Middle America, even if its economic illiteracy ends up hurting the entire country.
In 2016, conservatives might have to surrender to Trump and/or find some way of distancing themselves from him. But in the long run, they have to acknowledge the issues he has raised and build some kind of constructive partnership with his voters. 
Republicans and a few crossover Democrats are defecting to Donald Trump. He is huge, and he isn't going away.

Trump: People say I 'have the most beautiful hands',http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/donald-trump-marco-rubio-beautiful-hands/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 19:25:22,,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Tuesday brushed aside demeaning comments from Marco Rubio about the size of his hands, saying others disagree with the Florida senator.
""He said I have small hands -- I'm actually 6'3"", not 6'2"" -- but I've always heard people say, 'Donald, you have the most beautiful hands,' "" Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Super Tuesday.
Trump was responding to an unusual attack from Rubio over the weekend. 
""He's always calling me Little Marco. And I'll admit he's taller than me. He's like 6'2"", which is why I don't understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5'2"","" Rubio said at a rally in Virginia Sunday night. ""And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can't trust them.""
It was just one of a series of personal attacks that Rubio has made in the last few days about Trump.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has endorsed Trump, also took a jab at Rubio at an Ohio rally on Tuesday. 
""Sen. Rubio is on the air of desperate,"" said Christie, who dropped out of the presidential race after the New Hampshire primary.

"Voter turnout shows Trump, not Sanders, leading a revolution",http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/election-2016-turnout-records/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 17:49:35,,"Bernie Sanders talks extensively about revolution, but it appears that it's actually Donald Trump who is driving record numbers of voters to the polls with his fiery populist message. 
Republicans voted in unprecedented numbers on Super Tuesday, setting record numbers in contests throughout different regions of the country.
Every state holding a Republican contest Tuesday -- with the exception of Vermont -- reached a new high for participation. But none of the state's holding Democratic contests broke any records.
Texas, home to a battle royale between Trump and native son Ted Cruz, saw a whopping 2.7 million voters show up for the Republican contest -- 1.2 million more than the previous record in 2012. 
In Virginia, 1,013,000 voters -- almost 350,000 more voters showed up than the previous record-setting year, 2008. And in Georgia, 1,273,000 voted Tuesday -- more than 300,000 above the record set in 2008.
That continue a trend this cycle of record-breaking Republican contests, beginning with Iowa and continuing in South Carolina, where Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore praised the 730,000 people who showed up a little more than a week ago, well more than the 603,000 South Carolinians who voted in the 2012 Republican primary.
All of which helps explain why Trump was crowing about a ""movement"" in his victory speech Tuesday night. As Chris Christie stood by his side, Trump referenced part of the New Jersey governor's reasoning for joining his campaign.
""When Chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign, he called me, he said 'Donald, what you've got is a movement,' "" Trump said Tuesday. ""He said, 'This is a movement; this is something like I've never seen.' And in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing. They've never seen what's happening right now. They've never seen anything like it. And I'm just honored by it.""
Sanders, who has been drawing large crowds throughout his presidential candidacy, has long spoken of leading his own political revolution.
On Tuesday night, speaking in his home state of Vermont after picking up a victory there and in three other contests, Sanders noted his revolution is about ""bringing millions of millions"" of new voters to the polls.
""What that revolution is about is bringing millions of millions of people into the political process. Working people who have been so disillusioned, they no longer vote. Young people who have never been involved,"" Sanders said Tuesday evening in his victory speech in Vermont. 
However, the numbers show he's coming up short of aspirations. States hosting Democratic contests Tuesday night did not set any records. Many did not see as large of turnouts as they saw in 2008, and some saw larger turnouts in the 1980s and 1990s, according to preliminary totals.
Republican officials, on the other hand, were astonished by the Trump effect. 
""It is just phenomenal. We are roughly 50% higher than our next highest turnout in our history for an election like this,"" Alaska Republican Party Chairman Peter Goldberg told XXX's Paul Vercammen, regarding the 21,930 who caucused there Tuesday.
