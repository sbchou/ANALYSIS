XXX delegate count: Trump not yet on track to win nomination,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US--GOP%202016/id-14716e4ee74e437caa21874223eb771a,ap,3/2/2016 20:49:56,,"Despite Donald Trump's string of Super Tuesday victories, the billionaire businessman must do even better in upcoming primaries to claim the Republican presidential nomination before the party's national convention this summer, an XXX delegate count shows.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is emerging as the candidate who might stop him  with a little help from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
The good news for Trump: He is in a better position than any of his rivals. Through the first 15 states of the 2016 campaign season, the best chance for Cruz, Rubio or any of the other candidates could be a contested national convention in July that would almost certainly wreak further havoc on the deeply divided Republican Party.
""I think anybody that precludes any possibility at this point doesn't understand what's going on,"" said John Jordan, a California-based Republican donor now supporting Rubio. ""Anything can happen.""
While Trump has racked up 10 wins so far, he's won only 46 percent of the delegates awarded since voting began. It takes an outright majority of delegates to win the nomination.
To win enough delegates to claim that prize, Trump would have to win 51 percent of the remaining delegates awarded in the state-by-state contests scheduled through early June. That could be difficult if three or more candidates stay in the race.
Republican leaders in Washington and in statehouses across the country are scrambling to stop Trump
Trump's main Republican opponents are vowing to stay in the race until the end. And that could prevent him from getting the delegates needed to win the nomination outright  even if they can't overtake him on their own.
""We're beyond the winning states stage. This is now purely a competition for delegates,"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said.
Rubio, in a Tuesday interview on Fox News, promised to campaign in all 50 states, ""even if I have to get in my pickup truck and drive all over this country. I will do whatever it takes to prevent a con artist like Donald Trump from ever becoming the Republican nominee.""
While not giving up on beating Trump before the convention, both the Cruz and Rubio camps concede that their best opportunity could come at a contested convention in July.
That happens only if no candidate takes a majority of delegates before then. Under such a scenario, delegates on the floor of the Cleveland convention would decide on their own whom to support in a series of floor votes.
Not since 1976 has there been a contested convention.
Some Republicans warn of dire consequences should the party go that route this year, especially if Trump has a commanding delegate lead.
""If the establishment thinks there's a backlash now, wait until the guy with the most delegates gets to the convention and they decide to take it from him,"" said GOP operative Hogan Gidley. ""Then you're going to see an all-out political jihad.""
The Republican campaign now enters a critical two-week stretch ahead of the March 15 primaries. These are the first primaries that can award all of a state's delegates to the winner, and the two big prizes are Florida and Ohio. Florida has 99 delegates, Ohio 66.
Winning those states could boost Trump to a commanding lead in the delegate count, but Florida is Rubio's home state and Ohio is home for John Kasich, the state's governor.
Only nine states award delegates winner-take-all. Five more make it possible for one candidate to win all of the delegates, or at least a large majority. These states could take an outsized role in determining who wins the nomination.
Among the other winner-take-all primaries:  Arizona on March 22, Nebraska on May 10 and New Jersey on June 7.
The delegate math from Super Tuesday shows how difficult it can be to rack up a big lead when states award delegates in proportion to the vote.
Trump won seven of 11 states, but his gains were limited by Cruz's big win in delegate-rich Texas  his home state. For the night, Trump won at least 237 delegates and Cruz won at least 209. Rubio was a distant third with at least 94.
There were still 33 delegates left to be allocated on Wednesday.
Cruz won at least 99 of the 155 delegates at stake in Texas. Trump got at least 38, with 14 left to be awarded. Rubio picked up four.
Overall, Trump leads the field with 319 delegates and Cruz has 226. Rubio has 110, Kasich has 25 and Ben Carson has eight.
It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president."

Voters in a dozen states put their imprint on the race, and in the bulk of contests rewarded the national front-runners, stretching their leads in delegates needed to clinch the nomination and making them ever harder to stop.
In short, Super Tuesday unfolded in largely expected ways when what the alternatives to Trump and Clinton really needed was the unexpected  something to jolt the sense that they are at risk of being left inexorably behind.
Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas each won their home states and prevailed in Oklahoma, with several states still to be decided.
Clinton won Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia, Texas and Arkansas, the state her husband, Bill, served as governor on his way to the presidency.
Trump took Alabama, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Georgia, Virginia and Arkansas as attention turned to Western states reporting later.
A look at biggest day in the calendar of presidential primaries and caucuses.
___
HOW THEY WON
Clinton dominated again with older people and ate into Sanders' support among the 30-to-44 crowd. Sanders had a clear advantage with only one age group: his devoted under-30 followers.
Trump and his rebel yell against the status quo attracted nearly two-thirds of voters looking to install an outsider in the White House. Those who cared more about political experience split about evenly between first-term Sens. Rubio and Cruz, according to early results of exit polls.
___
WHAT'S THE SCORE?
With results still coming in, Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday delegates, while Cruz picked up at least 52. Overall, Trump leads the Republican field with 221 delegates.  It takes 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination.
Clinton was assured of gaining at least 334 delegates from Super Tuesday, with Sanders getting at least 145. Counting superdelegates, the Democratic insiders who can choose any candidate, Clinton now has at least 882 delegates. It takes 2,383 to win the Democratic nomination.
Clinton and Trump have each won at least nine states since the nomination contests began. It's at least three each for Sanders and Cruz.
___
RUBIO'S RUBICON?
For all the endorsements, money and attention rallied behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as the GOP's only hope to stop Trump, he's yet to win a state and short on time to stage a turnaround.
His home state will be a battleground royale on March 15, with part-time Floridian Trump running hard to knock him out of the race and avenge the lacerating taunts coming almost constantly from the senator since the last debate.
___
EXIT POLLING
In six states (Texas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas), large majorities of Republican primary voters expressed support for temporarily banning all non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S., a Trump proposal, according to early results of exit polls.
But Republican voters were more divided on another of his contentious ideas, to deport all people who are in the U.S. illegally. The proposal won majority support only in Alabama, among seven states where that question was asked of GOP voters.
___
VOTERS SAY...
""Ultimately, if we have to elect someone who is borderline crazy to get people to understand what's going on, then that's what we have to do.""  Tyler Murphy, 26, of Boston, explaining his vote for Trump in the Republican contest.  His backup choice was Clinton, a Democrat.
""I'm so appalled at the choices."" Gillian Gattie, 72, also of Boston. After 2008 and 2012 votes for Barack Obama, she was voting this time in the GOP race, for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
""I can't get excited for Bernie Sanders.""  Gillian's twin sister, Vivien Gattie, who reluctantly voted for Clinton.
""I stood in line for six hours the other day at a Trump rally because to me he's just the man. He is the one that is going to make the country great again.""  Jeanie Lindsey, in Helena, Alabama.
___
THE LINEUP
Both parties held contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. As well, Republicans voted in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also had a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats abroad.
___
______
WHY IT MATTERS
Immigration policy, the swollen U.S. debt, the uneven spread of wealth and hard questions about how to approach the Islamic State, terrorism and civil liberties are all in play for voters.
So is the fate of fundamental social policy as the Supreme Court stands ideologically divided. A vacancy may not be filled until after the next president takes office in January.
___
TEXAS AND THE SOUTH
The South enjoyed more influence in this campaign because of several states added to the Super Tuesday roster, giving this subset the nickname ""SEC primary,"" a nod to the Southeastern Conference of college sports. Clinton once again demonstrated her pull with black voters, as she did in overwhelming fashion in South Carolina over the weekend.
The biggest Super Tuesday state overall was Texas, where Cruz prevailed with his home-state advantage, prime endorsements from the governor down the political chain and a veritable army of some 27,000 volunteers."
XXX News Guide: Super Tuesday is super 'nail-bitey',http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election-News%20Guide/id-bf84766c57ea4f6c8c30c08bab25f93c,ap,3/1/2016 9:22:27,,"Super Tuesday is the big gulp moment for any presidential candidate who makes it that far. It's the biggest day of competition in American democracy except for Election Day itself. It's super nail-bitey, super expensive and often super-clarifying  the killer and maker of dreams.
So will it set everything straight in the chaotic presidential race?
Maybe. Quite possibly not.
___
MARCO 'RAMBO' & CO.
Five Republicans are still mixing it up, but all the bellowing is either by or about GOP front-runner Donald Trump. The New Yorker is driving toward the Republican nomination and his rivals are trying to splatter him with everything they have.
Tuesday will answer whether Marco Rubio's debate-night transformation from bland RubioBot to Marco Rambo can begin to take down the months-long leader in preference polls and now delegates.
The fight that the Republican establishment long wanted has been engaged. Whether it's too late to stop the outsider capitalist-populist is the question.
And it's not all high-minded rhetoric by any means. Trump made fun of Rubio's ears; Rubio cracked that Trump may have wet his pants during the debate.
Similar suspense, with fewer insults, animates the Democratic race.
Hillary Clinton, the establishment pick, scored a weekend blowout in South Carolina on Saturday, looks strong in many Super Tuesday states and would become an overwhelming favorite for the nomination if she performs to expectations.
A surprise could reinvigorate Bernie Sanders, her socialist-populist rival who has tapped deep political passions but needs more actual victories, and soon.
___
WHY IT MATTERS
Immigration policy, the swollen U.S. debt, the uneven spread of wealth and hard questions about how to approach the Islamic State, terrorism and civil liberties are all in play for voters.
So is the fate of fundamental social policy as the Supreme Court stands ideologically divided. A vacancy may not be filled until after the next president takes office in January.
Trump's agenda lacks detail on most fronts and often seems improvised. But there's little doubt about his intended approach on several major matters.
He would try to browbeat trading partners and others into doing his will. He would be on the hook for somehow carrying out mass deportations of people in the country illegally, for temporarily banning non-U.S. citizen Muslims from coming into the country and for replacing President Barack Obama's health care law with a system that does not, as he put it, leave people to die on the street.
Democrats have a choice between liberal pragmatism and liberal ambition.
Sanders preaches free college, a transformation of health care to a government-financed ""Medicare-for-all"" system and a breakup of big banks as part of an agenda centered on shrinking the gap between rich and poor.
That means a far heftier safety net, at the cost of higher taxes and what a lot of economists say would be higher national debt. Clinton says his goals are politically impossible and she would follow an achievable, yet still activist path.
___
A TRANSITION
Until now, it was ephemeral. Who's doing better and worse than expected? Who's rising and falling? Who's got, you know, momentum?
It's mainly about the number of delegates now  the inexorable grind of arithmetic.
Until now, voters in four states have picked not much more than a sliver of the delegates who are needed to clinch the party nominations.
That changes overnight, with each party holding contests in 11 states. Democrats also vote in American Samoa.
Republicans will allocate 595 delegates from the results of Super Tuesday, nearly half of the 1,237 needed for the nomination.
Democrats will allocate 865, more than one-third of the necessary 2,383.
___
WHAT'S THE SCORE?
3-1 for Trump and Clinton.
He won New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. She won Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina.
Republican Ted Cruz won Iowa. Sanders won New Hampshire.
In the Republican delegate race: it's 82 for Trump, 17 for Ted Cruz, 16 for Rubio, 6 for John Kasich and 4 for Ben Carson.
In the Democratic race, factoring in the hundreds of superdelegates, or party insiders who can support a candidate of their choice, Clinton leads with 546 delegates, according to XXX's count, while Sanders has 87.
___
MOMENTUM STILL COUNTS
As enormous as the prize is on Tuesday, no one candidate can win their party's nomination on the night. The delegate trove is proportional in each party, and delegates will be divvied up according to how well each contender does.
That's an oversimplification of an arcane process, but the bottom line is that a strong second place in a particular state can be worth almost as many delegates as a victory. So the perception of who's making headway still matters. A candidate on the move can attract more money, national attention and voter interest.
At least for a few more weeks.
A series of winner-take-all Republican primaries is coming, none bigger than Florida on March 15, where a cache of 99 delegates is at stake and Rubio will be bidding furiously for a home-state victory against Trump, a part-time resident who got a head start on organizing there.
___
TEXAS AND THE SOUTH
The South bid for more influence in this campaign by adding states to its Super Tuesday roster, naming this subset the SEC primary in a nod to the Southeastern Conference of college sports. Clinton demonstrated her pull with black voters in South Carolina, suggesting she may do well in other Southern states with significant black populations.
The biggest Super Tuesday state overall is Texas, where Sen. Cruz has a home-state advantage built on prime endorsements from the governor down the political chain and a veritable army of some 27,000 volunteers.
Everything in politics is double-edged, though.
If Trump's rebel yell attracts enough support to make him the winner or even a close second, Cruz will face sharp questions about his viability.
___
THE LINEUP
Both parties are holding contests Tuesday in these states: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.
As well, Republicans vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad.
In the 12 states holding contests, polls close at 7 p.m. EST in three (Virginia, Georgia and Vermont), and at 8 p.m. EST in four more (Oklahoma, Alabama, Tennessee and Massachusetts). The rest, Eastern time: 8:30 p.m. in Arkansas, 9 p.m. in Texas, Colorado and Minnesota; and midnight in Alaska."
"Before Trump, there was Jesse Ventura _ and a big victory",http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--GOP%202016-Trump-Ventura/id-6c4aca1ba75c4b04ab94a0bdd77883f0,ap,3/1/2016 14:23:15,,"He was a candidate few thought stood a chance. Best known as a television showman, he seemed more interested in self-promotion than winning public office. But soon he was dominating media coverage and debate stages, each pungent remark only endearing him more to a disenchanted public.
Then Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura became governor of Minnesota.
Well before Donald Trump shook up the race for the Republican presidential nomination, there was Ventura, the former professional wrestler, radio talk show host and suburban mayor who  in his own election-night words  ""shocked the world"" with his improbable 1998 victory.
As Trump looks to expand his delegate lead in Super Tuesday contests and further show that he's for real, the similarities between his campaign and Ventura's continue to grow. The billionaire businessman enters the biggest day of the race so far with several wins under his belt and exuding confidence about his chances in the contests across the Deep South. His top rivals, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are struggling to contain him.
""Jesse's success is the perfect case history to show this can happen,"" said Bill Hillsman, a Minneapolis ad man and close Ventura adviser who came up with several memorable campaign ads, including one that depicted Ventura as an action figure who tells special interests: ""I don't want your stupid money.""
""Donald Trump's campaign is just Jesse's campaign writ very large, with more money and some hugely advantageous communications tools"" such as social media and online organizing, Hillsman said.
There are differences, of course, particularly on social issues. Trump has proposed expanding the border wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico and has rejected gay marriage. Ventura has supported open borders and said during a 1998 debate that government shouldn't be involved in who may marry.
Ventura also was a Reform Party candidate who blasted Republicans and Democrats as ""rival gangs,"" while Trump is seeking the GOP nomination.
But voters see Trump as sufficiently untethered from the party. Both Trump and Ventura are brash and loose with words, much in contrast to the more scripted traditional candidates.
That was enough to draw Darren Anderson to the polls in 1998, when at age 25 he was one of many first-time voters who helped Ventura win. Anderson, now 43, recalls watching a debate between ""Jesse,"" Democrat Skip Humphrey and Republican Norm Coleman. Ventura was the only one who ""called a spade a spade.""
""He wasn't your standard politician and he wasn't blowing smoke.""
That's also why the teacher from New Ulm, Minnesota, is now leaning toward Trump in Minnesota's vote Tuesday. While in the back of his mind he worries a Trump presidency could ""go really wrong,"" he says the GOP front runner ""is saying things the country wants to hear.""
Both Ventura and Trump drew some of their strongest support from blue collar voters who dislike the political establishment.
But Ventura's typical voter was younger, largely male and ""for the most part regarded the election as a giant kegger,"" said St. Cloud State University political science professor Stephen Frank, who co-wrote a book on Ventura's election.
Ventura appealed to them as much for his personality as for his promises to cut taxes amid a budget surplus. Coleman, a former St. Paul mayor, and Humphrey, the son of former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, focused on each other during debates, ignoring Ventura.
Ventura told XXX Monday he sees echoes of his campaign in Trump's. But he's split between supporting Trump or Sen. Bernie Sanders, who's vying for the Democratic nomination. He's also considering his own bid as a third-party Libertarian candidate.
Dane Smith, who spent 30 years as a reporter in St. Paul and Minneapolis and covered Ventura, recalls a ""Trump-like"" feeling in the governor's race when polls showed Ventura running surprisingly strong.
""You were saying to yourself 'Holy cow. This guy isn't going to collapse,' "" Smith said.
Even Ventura needed some convincing on election night. After the first TV station called the race saying he'd won, the governor-elect told his team he wanted to wait for more results before making his victory speech.
Ventura had a mixed record as governor. After campaigning on a tax cut, Ventura refunded part of a state surplus to taxpayers  payments he dubbed ""Jesse checks."" He oversaw building of the Twin Cities' light rail and provided more money for schools.
But he also butted heads with lawmakers and seemed to tire of the day-to-day slog of government. Toward the end of his first term he said he wouldn't seek another.
""There's no consensus whether he was a bad governor or an average governor,"" Smith said. ""There is sort of a consensus he was far too egotistical and self-centered, that the whole purpose was to serve his own fame and fortune.""
Still, Minnesota voters like Anderson say if there's a lesson for 2016, it's to take Trump seriously.
""So many people took it as a joke, a big public joke,"" Anderson said. ""And then they win.""

Ben Carson says 'no path forward' in his bid for White House,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US-GOP-2016-Carson/id-a433cde934924b24b4e3999ef41e8edf,ap,3/2/2016 20:49:56,,"Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said he is effectively ending his bid for the White House Wednesday, concluding a roller-coaster campaign that briefly took him to the top of a chaotic GOP field but ended with a Super Tuesday whimper.
""I do not see a political path forward,"" Carson said in a statement posted on his campaign website, though he added, ""I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America"" and promised to offer details of his future when he speaks Friday at a conservative conference in Washington.
He did not explicitly say that he's ending his campaign, only noting that he does not plan to take part in Thursday's Fox News debate. But his longtime businessman and friend, Armstrong Williams, confirmed that the soft-spoken candidate would no longer be asking for votes.
""There's only one candidate in this 2016 election on the GOP side, and his name is Trump. That's the reality,"" Williams said, adding that Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz also should drop out, as they ""also have no path"" to the nomination.
Carson's exit reduces the active Republican field to four candidates, though billionaire Donald Trump remains the clear leader in earned delegates and voter preference polls.
Carson, 64, was one of several anti-establishment candidates who shaped the early stages of a Republican race defined by conservatives' wide-ranging disgust with the nation's direction and GOP leaders' perceived inability to alter it.
He ran as an outsider, offering a poverty-to-fame autobiography, his unabashed Christian faith and an unceasing indictment of conventional politics, styling his bid as an effort to combat ""political correctness"" and what he described as a creep toward ""socialism.""
That formula fueled a steady climb in the polls and a powerful fundraising effort. But his success also brought intense scrutiny. Carson lashed out publicly at questions about his life story, having to explain anecdotes like his claim to have been offered a ""scholarship"" to West Point. He made foreign policy flubs, from a mistaken suggestion that China is militarily involved in Syria's civil war, to a high profile speech in which he repeatedly mispronounced the name of the Palestinian political and military organization Hamas.
And he endured public sniping among some of his closest advisers, some of whom contributed to questions about his overall fitness for the job.
The only African-American among the presidential contenders of either major party, Carson announced his bid in May from his native Detroit, where he was raised in a poor neighborhood by a single mother. Though she could not read, Carson said, his mother saw to it that he and his brother received formal educations.
Carson attended Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School. He earned national acclaim during 29 years leading the pediatric neurosurgery unit of Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. He directed the first surgery to separate twins connected at the back of the head. His career was notable enough to inspire the 2009 movie, ""Gifted Hands,"" with actor Cuba Gooding Jr. depicting Carson.
He rose to political prominence with his address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, where he offered a withering critique of the modern welfare state and the nation's overall direction. The speech restated themes from Carson's 2012 book ""America the Beautiful,"" but he excited conservatives by doing so with President Barack Obama sitting just feet away.
He would often tell voters that he viewed his candidacy as a way to honor the American founders' view of the ""citizen-statesman.""
""If I am successful in this endeavor,"" he said Dec. 8 in Georgia, ""then a lot of other people who are not career politicians but who are very smart will start thinking, maybe I can do that, too, and we will expand the pool from which we selected our leadership.""

"Christie's shell-shocked look stirs mockery, befuddlement",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-03-02-US-GOP-2016-Christie-Under-Fire/id-7bc449cc8f0d4503bc23b5fb51becafb,ap,3/2/2016 20:29:11,," (AP)  Was that really Chris Christie, the brusque, take-a-back-seat-to-no-one governor of New Jersey?
Christie's seemingly shell-shocked gaze as he stood behind Donald Trump on Super Tuesday is generating befuddlement and mockery in his home state and beyond.
Conservatives and liberals alike have piled on.
His introductory remarks were so subdued and his appearance was so grave that many people joked on the Internet that he looked like a hostage reading a coerced statement. ""Gov. Christie, blink twice if you're in trouble!"" one person tweeted.
In a move that shocked nearly everyone, especially in Democratic-leaning New Jersey, Christie endorsed Trump last week and has appeared at the billionaire businessman's side at campaign appearances over the past few days.
But after Tuesday night's appearance, conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg of the anti-Trump National Review imagined Christie was thinking: ""My God what have I done?"" Others saw the same thing in Christie's blank stare and robotic words of introduction.
Aside from Tuesday night, Christie appears to be fully embracing his surrogate duties. The governor has introduced Trump at a number of enthusiastic rallies and has been Trump's attack dog, sinking his teeth into Sen. Marco Rubio and vouching for Trump and his family.
Back home, the reaction has been fierce.
Republican Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and Environmental Protection Agency administrator, told The Star-Ledger of Newark last week she would rather vote for Hillary Clinton than Trump.
""I am ashamed that Christie would endorse anyone who has employed the kind of hate mongering and racism that Trump has,"" she said.
Six Gannett newspapers in New Jersey, including the Asbury Park Press, said he isn't fit to be governor any more. They called him a political opportunist who has neglected his duties in the Garden State, and urged him to resign.
A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll saw Christie's approval ratings fall from 33 percent before he backed Trump to 27 percent since. The poll sampled 694 registered New Jersey voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.
""Trump and Christie kind of do belong together, but not running our country,"" said Barbara Silverstein of Gibbsboro, New Jersey. ""It's a big show, and it's pretty pathetic.""
In the past few days, the politician with the outsized personality seemed to be shrinking in political stature even if something big  perhaps the No. 2 spot on the ballot with Trump  is his goal.
Trump was heard on a microphone telling Christie to get on a plane and go home after Christie was pressed Sunday in an ABC interview about his disagreement with Trump on his proposed ban on Muslims.
Christie refers to the candidate, who is supposedly his longtime friend, as ""Mr. Trump,"" while Trump refers to the governor as ""Chris.""
Christie defended his endorsement this week on his regular radio call-in show.
""I've known him personally for 14 years and I believe he is the best person to beat Hillary Clinton,"" the governor said, before clarifying that he, Christie, was the best candidate but that Trump is the best of the remaining contenders.
Christie wouldn't discuss on the call-in show whether he was hoping for a vice presidential or Cabinet slot.
Asked about his previous criticisms of Trump, Christie said that was a natural part of having to run against him  no different, he said, from George H.W. Bush calling Ronald Reagan's policies ""voodoo economics"" before becoming his vice presidential pick.
To Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Harrison, Christie's seeming thousand-yard stare seemed to reflect sadness.
""It really looked like heartbreak and kind of a bitter pill that he was swallowing,"" she said. ""I still think that in his heart of hearts he thinks he was destined to be president of the United States."""

Footage of Christie's stunned look, set to the jaunty theme song from HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" became a sensation online Wednesday. And Washington Post blogger Alexandra Petri wrote an extended riff about how Christie was ""screaming wordlessly"" as Trump spoke and had ""the glazed and terrified look of someone who has traded his inheritance for no pottage at all.""
Christie's office declined to comment on his appearance.

Trump was heard on a microphone telling Christie to get on a plane and go home this weekend, and Christie was pressed Sunday in an ABC interview about his disagreement with Trump on his proposed ban on Muslims.
Christie refers to the candidate, who is supposedly his longtime friend, as ""Mr. Trump,"" while Trump refers to the governor as ""Chris.""
Christie defended his endorsement this week on his regular radio call-in show.
""I've known him personally for 14 years and I believe he is the best person to beat Hillary Clinton,"" the governor said, before clarifying that he, Christie, was the best candidate but that Trump is the best of the remaining contenders.
Christie wouldn't discuss on the call-in show whether he was hoping for a vice presidential or Cabinet slot.
Asked about his previous criticisms of Trump, Christie said that was a natural part of having to run against him  no different, he said, from George H.W. Bush calling Ronald Reagan's policies ""voodoo economics"" before becoming his vice presidential pick.
To Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Harrison, Christie's far-off stare seemed to reflect sadness.
""It really looked like heartbreak and kind of a bitter pill that he was swallowing,"" she said. ""I still think that in his heart of hearts he thinks he was destined to be president of the United States.""

This story has been corrected to show that Trump was heard telling Christie to get on a plane and go home before the interview with ABC, not after.

Clinton looking to pull away in Democratic primaries,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-ELECTION-DEM/id-98833fbd4b8d40ac8b9420daa8198a99,ap,3/1/2016 18:29:22,,"Hillary Clinton enters a series of Super Tuesday contests poised to extend her lead over Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who risks a major setback for his insurgent campaign with a poor showing in primaries and caucuses across the nation.
Backed by black voters, Clinton aimed for a sweep of Southern states holding primaries on Tuesday and polls showed her with a big advantage in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Sanders could only bank on winning his home state of Vermont and both campaigns were vying for support in Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Virginia.
""I am confident that if there is a large voter turnout today across this country we are going to do well,"" Sanders said after voting in his home state of Vermont. He joked, ""After a lot of deliberation, I know that Bernie Sanders, here in Vermont, got at least one vote. I was working on my wife, so I probably got two.""
All told, Clinton and Sanders were competing for 865 delegates in 11 states and American Samoa on Tuesday, the biggest single-day prize of the 2016 campaign. Black voters powered Clinton to victory in South Carolina last weekend, with 8 in 10 voting for her, and were expected to give her a huge advantage throughout the South.
Clinton starts Tuesday with 546 delegates, including super delegates  the party leaders and members of Congress who can support any candidate. Sanders has 87 delegates and needs to begin winning states with a healthy margin to gain ground on Clinton. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.
Clinton was making a quick jaunt into Minnesota and then joining with supporters in Miami, a destination that foreshadows the importance of Florida as a general election battleground. She has already turned her attention to Republican front-runner Donald Trump, arguing that she would be the best candidate to help Democrats hold onto the White House after President Barack Obama's two terms.
Sanders decamped to his home in Burlington, Vermont, where he planned to watch the returns with his home state's faithful. At rallies in Minnesota and Massachusetts on Monday, Sanders vowed to fight on until the party's convention in July and his advisers pointed to a calendar that would be more accommodating later this month.
Asked by reporters in Boston if he would hurt the party's chances if he carried on, Sanders said only 15 states will have voted by Tuesday and it was ""more than appropriate"" to let people ""vote for the candidate of their choice.""
But the map, at least on Tuesday, did not appear to be helping Sanders. Because Democrats award their delegates proportionally, Clinton could use blowout victories in the South to add to her delegate haul.
Sanders was expected to win handily in Vermont but the other states where he was competing  Minnesota, Massachusetts and Oklahoma  were expected to be narrowly contested, making it unlikely he will cut into Clinton's advantage.
Despite his obstacles, the Vermont senator has little incentive to fold. He reported raising more than $42 million in February, a sign that he will have the money to go deep into the spring. And his team views a series of caucuses in Nebraska and Kansas and Michigan's primary later this month as places where he could regain some momentum.
Super Tuesday has been pivotal for the Clintons before. Then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton used a sweep of Southern states in March 1992 to establish himself as the front-runner for the party's nomination, setting him on a course for the White House."

"Clinton, Trump cemented as 2016 leaders; GOP desperate",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US-Campaign-2016/id-5d70d1e3ef184635897074c7c264915b,ap,3/2/2016 13:59:55,,"Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump seized decisive Super Tuesday victories with math and momentum on their side, leaving rivals scrambling for last-chance, long-shot strategies. For the Republican establishment, the search was increasingly dire.
Trump's seven victories in states across the country amounted to a GOP establishment collapse with no clear sign of rapid recovery. While his rivals promised to fight on, the party remained deeply divided over the preferred Trump alternative. Marco Rubio won only liberal Minnesota. Sen. Ted Cruz took his home state of Texas, neighboring Oklahoma and Alaska.
Clinton also won seven of the nearly a dozen states that weighed in Tuesday. Rival Bernie Sanders won his home state of Vermont, as well as Minnesota, Oklahoma and Colorado.
In his victory speech, Trump sent a chilling warning to the GOP establishment. A moment after Trump professed to have good relationships with his party's elite, he issued a warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had declared earlier Tuesday that ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices."" Trump said that if the two don't get along, Ryan is ""going to have to pay a big price.""
Clinton, meanwhile, called for ""love and kindness""  a contrast to hard-edge Trump  while her rival Bernie Sanders promised to fight on to the convention.
Both victors spoke from Florida, which did not vote on Tuesday, but where the general election is often won or lost.
Both Rubio and Cruz said they would fight on.
""Our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz thundered to supporters gathered at the wood-paneled Redneck Country Club in Stafford, Texas.
Still, he'd been counting on more appeal in the Southern states and among evangelical Christian voters. Trump, who dubs his surging campaign the ""Trump Train,"" has derailed those plans.
Rubio and the other Republicans still in the race, John Kasich and Ben Carson, struggled Tuesday to convey optimism even as they vowed to fight on.
Simple math reinforces a bind for the Republicans who reject Trump, as the brash billionaire businessman carried seven states and continues to barrel toward the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the GOP nomination.
Trump won at least 203 delegates Tuesday. Cruz collected at least 144 delegates and Rubio picked up at least 71. Overall, Trump leads with 285 delegates, Cruz has 161, Rubio has 87, Kasich has 25 and Carson has eight. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination.
Increasingly, leading Republicans talk of a contested convention in July as their best remaining option for stopping Trump, whose divisive rhetoric about immigrants and ethnic and religious groups has some fearing a GOP wipeout in November.
Sanders assured supporters he'd take his fight to ""every one"" of the remaining contests. With a staggering $42 million raised in February alone, Sanders has the campaign cash to do just that though Clinton is well on her way to the 2,383 delegates needed on the Democratic side.
Clinton collected wins in seven states, and Trump swept up victories in seven, including Virginia, another important general election battleground.
She is assured of winning at least 457 of the 865 delegates at stake Tuesday. Sanders gains at least 286. When including party leaders, Clinton has at least 1,005 delegates and Sanders has at least 373.
Clinton held on to older voters and strongly prevailed among Hispanics and African-Americans, according to exit polls conducted for XXX and television networks by Edison Research. Trump, a political newcomer, pulled in two-thirds of voters looking to install an outsider in the White House, while GOP voters seeking an experienced candidate were split between Rubio and Cruz, both first-term senators.
Speaking from his gold-flecked Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump asserted that his candidacy is a ""movement"" and he claimed he would unify the party was by training his fire on Clinton.
He said she should be disqualified from even running for office because she broke from government protocol by using a private email server while she was secretary of state.
Clinton tried to turn Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan on its head, saying the country instead must be made ""whole again.""
""What we need in America today is more love and kindness,"" she said. ""Instead of building walls, we're going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment.""
Trump ridiculed her comments. ""She's been there for so long,"" he said. ""If she hasn't straightened it out by now, she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years.""
Rubio said his supporters would never rally around Trump. He and Kasich showed little sign of relenting, especially with their home states of Florida and Ohio voting on March 15.
""We are so excited about what lies ahead for our campaign,"" Rubio said at his Tuesday night rally in Miami, his hometown. ""You see, just five days ago we began to unmask the true nature of the front-runner in this race.""
He portrayed his attacks on Trump as having an impact already, though that wasn't evident in Super Tuesday's results.
""Two weeks from tonight right here in Florida,"" Rubio said, ""we are going to send a message loud and clear: The party of Lincoln and Reagan will never be held by a con artist."""

Clinton also carried Texas, the night's biggest prize.
On the Republican side, Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas, as well as neighboring Oklahoma. Democrat Bernie Sanders picked up a home-state win as well, in Vermont, and won in Oklahoma, too.
Still, the night belonged to Trump and Clinton, who turned the busiest day of the 2016 primaries into a showcase of their strength with a wide swath of American voters.
""What a Super Tuesday,"" Clinton exclaimed during a victory rally.
As Trump's victories piled up, he fired off ""thank you"" Twitter notes to the states that landed in his win column. The billionaire businessman scheduled a nighttime news conference at his swanky Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, eschewing the traditional election night rally.
Cruz desperately needed a win in Texas in order to stay in the race, and was likely to keep campaigning as the only Republican who has been able to defeat Trump in any primary contest.
For Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the night was turning into a disappointment. While a flood of Republican officeholders have rallied around him in recent days, his first victory remained elusive as results rolled in.
Still, Rubio, who has launched an aggressive campaign to stop Trump in recent days, vowed to keep up his efforts to ""unmask the true nature of the front-runner in this race.""
The Florida senator's long-shot White House hopes now rest with his home state, which votes on March 15. But he's expected to face fresh calls from Trump and others to drop out of the race before then.
""He has to get out,"" Trump told Fox News earlier in the day. ""He hasn't won anything.""
Super Tuesday marked the busiest day of the 2016 primaries, with the biggest single-day delegate haul up for grabs. Democrats voted in 11 states and American Samoa, with 865 delegates at stake. Republicans voted in 11 states, with 595 delegates.
Clinton also picked up wins in Alabama and Arkansas, while Trump carried the GOP contests in Alabama and Massachusetts.
Clinton steadied herself after an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sanders. The Vermont senator did carry his home state decisively, and told the crowd at a raucous victory party that he was ""so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country.""
Exit polls underscored Sanders' continued weakness with black voters, a core part of the Democratic constituency. Clinton led with African-Americans, as well as both men and women, in Georgia and Virginia, according to surveys conducted by Edison Research for XXX and television networks.
Sanders continued to show strength with young voters, carrying the majority of those under the age of 30.
The contests come at a turbulent time for the GOP, given Trump's strengths in the face of opposition from many party leaders. Some in the party establishment fear the anti-Trump campaign has come too late.
Trump's wins in the South were a blow to Cruz, who once saw the region as his opportunity to stake a claim to the nomination.
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Instead, he's appeared to only grow stronger, winning states and drawing broad support for some of his most controversial proposals.
In six of the states on Tuesday, large majorities of Republican voters said they supported a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States, an idea championed by Trump. Two-thirds of GOP voters in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, 7 in 10 in Tennessee, and nearly 8 in 10 in Alabama supported the proposal, according to the early exit polls.
Worries among Republicans appeared to grow after Trump briefly refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke during a television interview. Trump later said he had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and he did repudiate him.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that anyone who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee must reject any racist group or individual.
States holding voting contests in both parties were Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Republicans also vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad."

Super Tuesday marked the busiest day of the 2016 primaries, with the biggest single-day delegate haul up for grabs. With elections in every region of the country, the contests put a spotlight on candidates' strengths and weaknesses with a broad swath of American voters.
For Clinton and Trump, the voting marked an opportunity to begin pulling away from their rivals and charting a course toward the general election. Each entered Super Tuesday having won three of four early voting contests, and more strong showings could start putting the nominations out of reach for other contenders.
Seconds after polls closed in Georgia, a confident Trump wrote on Twitter, ""Thank you Georgia!""
Sanders, who has mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge to Clinton in the Democratic race, was greeted enthusiastically during a victory rally in Vermont. He said that while he wants to win in every part of the country, it was particularly meaningful that his home state ""voted so strongly to put us in the White House.""

Cruz once saw the Southern states that voted Tuesday as his opportunity to stake his claim to the nomination. Now his campaign's future hinges on a victory in his home state of Texas, the biggest prize of the day.
Rubio's goal was even more modest. He was seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count and hoping to pull off a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.
Even before the first results started flowing in, Trump was calling on Rubio to give up if he didn't win anywhere on Tuesday.
""He has to get out,"" he told Fox News. ""He hasn't won anything.""

The disarray among Republicans comes as Clinton appears to be tightening her grip on the Democratic field. Her wins in Georgia and Virginia were the first of what her campaign hoped would be a sweep of the South, a region where large segments of the Democratic electorate are black.
In Georgia, just under half of Democratic voters on Tuesday were black, with 8 in 10 backing Clinton. About a quarter of Virginia's Democratic voters were black, and also overwhelmingly backed Clinton, according to exit polling.
Democratic voters were more likely to want a continuation of Obama's policies than switch to more liberal policies in eight of nine states where surveys were conducted.
Signaling her growing confidence, Clinton has increasingly turned her attention to Trump in recent days, casting herself as a civil alternative to the insults and bullying that have consumed the Republican race.
""What we can't let happen is the scapegoating, the flaming, the finger pointing that is going on the Republican side,"" she told voters in Springfield, Massachusetts. ""It really undermines our fabric as a nation.""
States holding voting contests in both parties were Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Republicans also vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad."

Republican races in those states were too close to call as polls closed.
Super Tuesday marked the busiest day of the 2016 primaries, with the biggest single-day delegate haul up for grabs. With elections in every region of the country, the contests put a spotlight on candidates' strengths and weaknesses with a broad swath of American voters.
For Clinton, as well as Republican front-runner Donald Trump, the voting marked an opportunity to begin pulling away from their rivals and charting a course toward the general election. Each entered Super Tuesday having won three of four early voting contests, and more strong showings could start putting the nominations out of reach for other contenders.
Clinton led in both Virginia and Georgia among both men and women, as well as black voters. Sanders continued to show strength with young voters, carrying the majority of those under the age of 30, according to early exit polls conducted by Edison Research for XXX and television networks.
Democrats were voting in 11 states and American Samoa on, with 865 delegates up for grabs. Republicans were voting in 11 states, with 595 delegates at stake.
The contests come at a turbulent time for the GOP, given Trump's strengths in the face of opposition from many party leaders. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz launched furious verbal attacks on the billionaire businessman in recent days, but some in the party establishment fear the anti-Trump campaign has come too late.
Cruz once saw the Southern states that voted Tuesday as his opportunity to stake his claim to the nomination. Now his campaign's future hinges on a victory in his home state of Texas, the biggest prize of the day.
Rubio's goal was even more modest. He was seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count and hoping to pull off a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.
Even before the first results started flowing in, Trump was calling on Rubio to give up if he didn't win anywhere on Tuesday.
""He has to get out,"" he told Fox News. ""He hasn't won anything.""
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Instead, he's appeared to only grow stronger, winning states and drawing broad support for some of his most controversial proposals.
In six of the states on Tuesday, large majorities of Republican voters said they supported a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States, an idea championed by Trump. Two-thirds of GOP voters in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, 7 in 10 in Tennessee, and nearly 8 in 10 in Alabama supported the proposal, according to the early exit polls.
Worries among Republicans appeared to grow after Trump briefly refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke during a television interview. Trump later said he had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and he did repudiate him.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that anyone who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee must reject any racist group or individual.
""When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up. So today I want to be very clear about something: If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games,"" Ryan said.

Those more interested in a candidate with political experience? They split about evenly between first-term senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, according to early results of exit polls conducted for XXX and television networks by Edison Research.

PORTRAIT OF  A TRUMP VOTER
Nine in 10 of Trump's voters are looking for an outsider. Half are angry with the government. Nearly as many want a candidate willing to ""tell it like it is."" Four in 10 said they were born again, cutting into Ted Cruz's efforts to claim the evangelical vote. Trump, who has professed mutual admiration with ""poorly educated voters,"" was favored by half of voters without a college degree. His followers are nothing if not loyal: Six in 10 of his voters made up their minds more than a month ago.
___
PORTRAIT OF CLINTON VOTER
More than 90 percent of Clinton's voters want an insider, and nearly half say experience is the quality they are looking for in a candidate.

GOP leaders: No place for bigotry in the Republican Party,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US-GOP-2016-Congress/id-12affb327f464d799c707102e583aad3,ap,3/1/2016 20:21:46,,"The two top Republican leaders in Congress denounced Donald Trump on Tuesday for his slow-moving disavowal of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted Trump's ""seeming ambivalence about David Duke and the KKK"" as Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned that anyone who wants the Republican president nomination must reject racism.
The rebuke of Trump came as GOP voters went to the polls in 11 states in a ""Super Tuesday"" of balloting that many Republicans fear could give the combative and controversial New Yorker unstoppable momentum toward claiming the GOP presidential nod.
""This party does not prey on people's prejudices. We appeal to their highest ideals. This is the Party of Lincoln,"" Ryan told reporters as voters in 11 states holding GOP contests headed to the polls on Super Tuesday.
At the same time, Ryan reiterated that he will support the eventual GOP presidential nominee.
Never mentioning Trump's name, Ryan and McConnell were clearly referring to the billionaire businessman's appearance Sunday on CNN when he declined to disavow the support of Duke and other white supremacists.
""Let me make it perfectly clear: Senate Republicans condemn David Duke, the KKK, and his racism,"" McConnell said.
""When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up. So today I want to be very clear about something: If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry,"" Ryan said.
Last year, Ryan and McConnell disavowed Trump's plan to block Muslims from entering the U.S. Otherwise, they've tried to stay clear of commenting on the race.
Trump subsequently disavowed Duke, blaming his interview performance Sunday on a bad earpiece.
His two top rivals  Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas  criticized Trump and said the GOP must condemn white supremacists.
But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi argued that ""Trump's radical agenda"" reflects the House Republican conference. Pelosi said that while some in the GOP are distancing themselves from Trump, Republicans refused to remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds and have blocked renewal of the Voting Rights Act.
""The reality is, Donald Trump is just being more candid about the agenda of discrimination House Republicans have been advancing for years,"" Pelosi said in a statement.
Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada noted that both GOP leaders say they expect to support the eventual nominee.
""Republicans say they they'll support a man who refuses to denounce the KKK so until they withdraw their support, talk is really cheap,"" Reid said.
On Tuesday, USA Today reported that a group of about 30 African-American students from Valdosta State University were kicked out of a Trump rally by law enforcement officials.
""The only reason we were given was that Mr. Trump did not want us there,"" 22-year-old senior Brooke Gladney told the newspaper. The campaign denied any role in their ouster from the event.
Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice presidential nominee, bemoaned the current discourse in the GOP and said it was time to get back to focusing on how Republicans would solve the nation's problems.
""We believe all people are created in the eyes of God and our government. This is fundamental. And if someone wants to be our nominee they must understand this,"" said the Wisconsin congressman.
He said he has tried to avoid commenting on the presidential race but felt a need to speak up.
""I try to stay out of the day-to-day ups and downs of the primary,"" Ryan said. ""But I've said when I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up.""
Many Washington Republicans are increasingly open about their dismay at the prospect of Trump winning the GOP nomination. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., an advocate of updating U.S. immigration law, said the prospect of voting for Trump is ""not a pleasant thought at all .... I'm still holding out hope we don't have that choice.""
Last month, Trump took a swipe at Ryan, saying the GOP lost the White House in 2012 because the vice presidential candidate was synonymous with a budget that targeted Social Security. That, according to Trump, cost Republicans with seniors.
Ryan rejected that argument on Tuesday, saying he and Mitt Romney won the senior vote by 12 percentage points, ""the best performance a Republican ticket has had since 1984 when Ronald Reagan had a landslide election."""
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump cemented as 2016 leaders,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US--Campaign%202016/id-8cd33d9a3bfe400ea1c08f8eae645120,ap,3/2/2016 8:59:18,,"Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, emboldened by commanding victories Tuesday across large swaths of the country, are beginning to focus on each other in the race for the White House.
Clinton previewed a ""love and kindness"" message while Trump traded his typical rollicking rallies for a sober media conference where he pressed his case that Clinton is a proven failure as a longtime politician.
Both spoke from Florida, where the general election is often won or lost. That wasn't one of the dozen states that weighed in on a day known as Super Tuesday because it's the busiest of the 2016 primary season.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz won his home state and Oklahoma, buttressing his out-of-the-gate win in the Iowa caucuses a month ago, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio notched his first victory, in Minnesota.
""Our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz thundered to supporters gathered at the wood-paneled Redneck Country Club in Stafford, Texas.
Still, he'd been counting on more appeal in the Southern states and among evangelical Christian voters. Trump, who dubs his surging campaign the ""Trump Train,"" has derailed those plans.
Rubio and the other Republicans still in the race, John Kasich and Ben Carson, struggled Tuesday to convey optimism even as they vowed to fight on.
Simple math reinforces a bind for the Republicans who reject Trump, as the brash billionaire businessman continues to barrel toward the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the GOP nomination.
Trump won at least 192 delegates Tuesday. Cruz collected at least 132 delegates and Rubio picked up at least 66. Overall, Trump leads with 274 delegates, Cruz has 149, Rubio has 82, Kasich has 25 and Carson has eight. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination.
Increasingly, leading Republicans talk of a contested convention in July as their best remaining option for stopping Trump, whose divisive rhetoric about immigrants and ethnic and religious groups has some fearing a GOP wipeout in November.
Like Cruz, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was victorious in his home state.
He also picked up victories in Oklahoma, Minnesota and Colorado, and he assured supporters he'd take his fight to ""every one"" of the remaining contests. With a staggering $42 million raised in February alone, Sanders has the campaign cash to do just that  though Clinton is well on her way to the 2,383 delegates needed on the Democratic side.
Tuesday's results left little doubt as to the front-runners in the race.
Clinton collected wins in eight states, and Trump swept up victories in at least seven, including Virginia, another important general election battleground.
She is assured of winning at least 457 of the 865 delegates at stake Tuesday. Sanders will gain at least 286. When including party leaders, Clinton has at least 1,005 delegates and Sanders has at least 373.
Clinton held on to older voters and strongly prevailed among Hispanics and African-Americans, according to exit polls conducted for XXX and television networks by Edison Research. Trump, a political newcomer, pulled in two-thirds of voters looking to install an outsider in the White House, while GOP voters seeking an experienced candidate were split between Rubio and Cruz, both first-term senators.
Speaking from his gold-flecked Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump asserted that his candidacy is a ""movement"" and that he is expanding the Republican Party even as many of its leaders have distanced themselves from him.
A moment after Trump professed to have good relationships with his party's elite, he issued a warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had declared earlier Tuesday that ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices."" Trump said that if the two don't get along, Ryan is ""going to have to pay a big price.""
One way Trump claimed he would unify the party was by training his fire on Clinton.
He said she should be disqualified from even running for office because she broke from government protocol by using a private email server while she was secretary of state.
Clinton tried to turn Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan on its head, saying the country instead must be made ""whole again.""
""What we need in America today is more love and kindness,"" she said. ""Instead of building walls, we're going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment.""
Trump ridiculed her comments. ""She's been there for so long,"" he said. ""If she hasn't straightened it out by now, she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years.""
Rubio said his supporters would never rally around Trump. He and Kasich showed little sign of relenting, especially with their home states of Florida and Ohio voting on March 15.
""We are so excited about what lies ahead for our campaign,"" Rubio said at his Tuesday night rally in Miami, his hometown. ""You see, just five days ago we began to unmask the true nature of the front-runner in this race.""
He portrayed his attacks on Trump as having an impact already, though that wasn't evident in Super Tuesday's results.
""Two weeks from tonight right here in Florida,"" Rubio said, ""we are going to send a message loud and clear: The party of Lincoln and Reagan will never be held by a con artist."""
How to stop Trump? GOP leaders search for a way,http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US--Campaign%202016/id-f28e9d873d36473fb9833c3c43eedded,ap,3/2/2016 19:58:33,,"Gripped by chaos and dismay, Republican leaders searched on Wednesday for a last-chance option to derail Donald Trump's momentum fueled by seven commanding Super Tuesday victories.
Overshadowed by Trump's wins, Ted Cruz came in a close second in the night's delegate haul, thanks to a win in his home state of Texas. The strong showing bolstered the senator's case to be the party's Trump alternative, even as rival Marco Rubio vowed to continue his fight.
The unrelenting division represented the biggest crisis for the GOP in decades, with the party seemingly on track to nominate a presidential candidate it can't contain. Some party leaders are considering the once unthinkable option of aligning behind Cruz, whom many dislike, while others are talking of a brokered convention. Some influential outsiders even raise the option of forming a new party.
Though convention fights are much more talked about than actually occur, an Associated Press delegate count indicates Trump will have to do better in upcoming contests to claim the nomination before the party's national gathering in July. So far, he has won 46 percent of the delegates awarded, and he would have to increase that to 52 percent in the remaining primaries.
The GOP mayhem contrasts sharply with the increasing cohesion on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton locked down solid victories in seven states and was on the path to regaining her status as the inevitable nominee. Clinton's dominance with black voters carried her to wins across the South. Still, Bernie Sanders picked up wins in his home state of Vermont as well as Minnesota, Oklahoma and Colorado, and he said he would fight on.
The Democratic drama paled in comparison to the existential questions Republicans wrestled with in the wake of the most significant election night of the primary. Trump won handily in states as politically opposite as Massachusetts and Alabama, a sign of his broad, outsider appeal and energizing impact on voter turnout.
Along with Texas, Cruz took neighboring Oklahoma and also Alaska. Florida Rubio won only liberal Minnesota.
Despite Trump's commanding victories, many Republican leaders remained deeply skeptical he could beat Clinton in a head-to-head matchup in November and some questioned whether they'd want him in the White House if he did. They turned to the sort of ""break glass"" options once thought impossible.
""Ted Cruz is not my favorite by any means,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former candidate whose disdain for his Texas colleague is well known, told CBS News. ""But we may be in a position where rallying around Ted Cruz is the only way to stop Donald Trump and I'm not so sure that would work.""
Still, Graham also cast doubt on whether elder GOP statesmen could wrest hold of the situation.
""At what point do you realize the Republican Party is unorganized -- like the Democratic Party? There's no secret group of people,"" he scoffed.
The comments came as #NeverTrump hashtag spread across Twitter and an anti-Trump Super Pac released a new online video and said it would increase its daily attacks ahead of primaries on March 8 and March 15. Our Principles PAC latest attack blasts Trump for not clearly repudiating David Duke, a onetime KKK member who endorsed Trump's campaign.
Other prominent Republicans called for more drastic measures.
""It may be necessary for men and women of principle within the party to set the self-detonation sequence as they escape the ship to a new party,"" wrote conservative blogger Erick Erickson. Erickson was among those calling on the party to coalesce around Cruz.
In his victory speech, Trump sent a clear message to the GOP establishment, warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had declared earlier Tuesday that ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices,"" that if the two don't get along, Ryan is ""going to have to pay a big price.""
Delegate math would seem to underscore the problem for Republicans who reject Trump.
For the night, Trump won at least 234 delegates and Cruz won at least 209. Rubio was a distant third with at least 90. There were still 40 delegates left to be allocated.
Overall, Trump leads with 316 delegates and Cruz has 226. Rubio has 106, John Kasich has 25 and Ben Carson eight.
The math was also tough for Sanders. Clinton was assured of winning at least 457 of the 865 delegates at stake Tuesday. Sanders gained at least 286. When including party leaders, Clinton has at least 1,005 delegates and Sanders has at least 373. It takes 2,383 to win the nomination.
Top Sanders advisers argue that Super Tuesday was the best day on the primary calendar for Clinton. But the map will get more difficult for her moving forward, said Sanders senior adviser Tad Devine."
It's a Super Tuesday for Clinton and Trump,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election%20Rdp/id-14ee33dd0b1042b1b473d1bd22ae0184,ap,3/2/2016 4:47:59,,"Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton swept through the South on Super Tuesday, claiming victory in their parties' primaries in delegate-rich Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia. The front-runners appeared ever more likely to end up in a general election showdown.
On the Republican side, Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas, the night's single biggest prize, as well as neighboring Oklahoma. Democrat Bernie Sanders picked up his home state of Vermont, as well as Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota, but failed to broaden his appeal with minority voters who are crucial to the party in presidential elections.
The night belonged to Trump and Clinton, who turned the busiest day of the 2016 primaries into a showcase of their strength with a wide swath of American voters.
Signaling her confidence, Clinton set her sights on Trump as she addressed supporters during a victory rally.
""It's clear tonight that the stakes in this election have never been higher and the rhetoric we're hearing on the other side has never been lower,"" she said.
Trump, too, had his eye on a general election match-up with the former secretary of state, casting her as part of a political establishment that has failed Americans.
""She's been there for so long,"" Trump said at his swanky Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. ""If she hasn't straightened it out by now, she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years.""
Trump's dominance has rattled Republican leaders, who fear he's unelectable against Clinton in November. Even as Trump professed to have good relationships with his party's elite, he issued a warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who declared earlier in the day that ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices."" Trump said that if the two don't get along, ""he's going to have to pay a big price.""
But all efforts to stop Trump have failed, including an aggressive campaign by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to discredit the billionaire businessman.
For Rubio, Super Tuesday turned into a bitter disappointment. He emerged with his first victory in Minnesota but failed to live up to the wider hopes of the numerous Republican officeholders who have promoted him as the party's best alternative to Trump.
With an eye on Florida's March 15 primary, Rubio vowed to keep up efforts to ""unmask the true nature of the front-runner in this race.""
Cruz desperately needed his win in Texas in order to stay in the race. He's the only Republican to beat Trump this primary season, a fact he wielded as he called on Rubio and other candidates to step aside.
""I ask you to prayerfully consider our coming together, united,"" Cruz said.
With results still coming in, Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday delegates, while Cruz picked up at least 52. Overall, Trump leads the Republican field with 221.
Sanders' wins did little to help him make up ground in his delegate race with Clinton. She was assured of winning at least 334 of the 865 at stake on Super Tuesday. That's compared to Sanders, who had at least 145 delegates.
Clinton also picked up wins in Texas, Arkansas and Massachusetts, nabbing her first victory in New England, while Trump carried the GOP contests in Arkansas and Massachusetts.
Trump's wins in the South were a major blow to Cruz, who once saw the region as his opportunity to stake a claim to the nomination. Instead, he's watched Trump, a brash New York real estate mogul, display surprising strength with evangelical Christians and social conservatives.
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming his populist appeal would fizzle. Instead, he's appeared to grow stronger, drawing broad support for some of his most controversial proposals.
In six of the states on Tuesday, large majorities of Republican voters said they supported a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States, an idea championed by Trump. Nine in 10 of Trump's voters were looking for an outsider, and half were angry with the government, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for XXX and television networks.
In the Democratic race, Clinton has steadied herself after an unexpectedly strong early challenge from Sanders. The Vermont senator did carry his home state decisively, and told the crowd at a raucous victory party that he was ""so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country.""
Sanders, who has energized supporters with his calls for a ""political revolution,"" has struggled to expand his base beyond young people and liberals. His weakness with black voters, a core part of the Democratic constituency, was underscored anew.
Clinton was supported by at least 80 percent of black voters in Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. She was also bolstered by women and older voters.
More than 90 percent of Clinton's voters wanted an insider, according to exit polls, and nearly half said experience was the top quality they were looking for in a candidate."
Rattled Republicans seek a last-ditch strategy to stop Trump,http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US--Campaign%202016/id-e7c2bf2b3be84ece8f6c4e635bb4302f,ap,3/2/2016 22:56:12,,"Staring down the prospect of nominating Donald Trump for president, Republicans spiraled into a chaotic, last-ditch search Wednesday for a way to save the GOP from hitching its fortunes to an unpredictable celebrity candidate without alienating his throng of followers.
Sensing a window closing fast, GOP leaders and elder statesmen toggled through a menu of scenarios but landed on none. Some amplified calls to rally around a Trump alternative, even if that alternative is Ted Cruz, a prickly conservative with few friends in the party.
Others laid out still-hazy plans for a brokered national convention, an option likely to smack of the backroom dealing Trump fans despise. Some floated more extreme measures, talking of breaking from the party and starting anew.
""It's all a play to stall it or try to deny him the nomination,"" said Neil Newhouse, a GOP pollster. ""And the problem with that is no one has the best scenario for how to do that.""
The scrambling came as the billionaire candidate racked up commanding victories in seven of eleven Super Tuesday primary contests, and the path to victory for his rivals narrowed. Trump's strength  which stretched from the Deep South to New England  exposed the depths of the divisions within the party, no matter who becomes the nominee in this election.
As Republicans surveyed the wreckage from Trump's surge, some argued there was still a chance to stop him. He was not yet on track to claim the nomination before the party's national gathering in July, according to an Associated Press delegate count. He has won 46 percent of the delegates awarded so far, and he would have to increase that to 51 percent in the remaining primaries.
""Trump had a good night, but he left the door open,"" said David Winston, a Republican pollster.
The GOP mayhem contrasted sharply with a clearer picture on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton on Tuesday locked down solid victories in seven states and was on the path to regaining her status as the inevitable nominee. Rival Sen. Bernie Sanders vowed to keep up the fight, campaigning in Maine on Wednesday.
Sanders, a fierce opponent of big money in politics, quoted director and screenwriter Adam McKay, winner of this year's Oscar for ""The Big Short"" adapted screenplay, who warned about candidates who take major contributions from ""weirdo billionaires.""
Republicans, meanwhile, looked for a wise man to calm the jitters and point the way.
Mitt Romney, their nominee four years ago, suggested he might try to fill that role. The former Massachusetts governor announced plans to speak on the ""state of the 2016 presidential race"" Thursday in Utah. Romney has moved aggressively to take on Trump in recent days, saying the billionaire's unreleased tax returns might contain ""bombshells."" But he was not expected to endorse a candidate or announce a late entry into the race himself.
Some Republican officials have said they would not support a Trump nomination, including Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford, but neither offered another alternative.
Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been approached by ""a mixture of people"" about being part of a third-party bid, said Jeff Miller, who managed Perry's failed GOP presidential campaign. But Miller said Perry found the idea ""ludicrous.""
XXX has asked Republican governors and senators if they would support Trump if he becomes the party's nominee. Of the 59 respondents, slightly less than half could not commit to backing him in November.
While his party looked for ways to stop him, Trump was trying to soften hard feelings. House Speaker Paul Ryan's office said the Trump campaign had reached out but the two men had not connected. It noted the speaker also planned to be in touch with other candidates.
If there is a chance of derailing Trump, who did not campaign Wednesday, it increasingly appears to rest with Cruz. The Texas senator came in just 25 delegates behind Trump Tuesday night, although he faces less favorable contests as the race presses on.
Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich also hold out hope they could catch fire in upcoming contests. Each must each win his home state primary on March 15 in order for that approach to have even a sliver of credibility. Rubio trails by double digits in most polls in Florida.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson all but ended his bid Wednesday, saying on his campaign website: ""I do not see a political path forward.""
Another approach to blocking Trump involves keeping the field crowded through the spring in order to keep his vote totals down. Even if he's winning states, he might be kept short of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination. That could allow Republican leaders to argue at a contested convention that the majority of GOP voters want someone else.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, that idea has the most support among those working for opponents' campaigns. Others in the party express concern about the image of the GOP establishment using arcane rules to thwart the will of voters.
There's also little consensus around the party's goals in a contested convention, beyond stopping Trump.
""The goal is this: Let's get to the convention in Cleveland and figure it out there,"" said Former New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu.
Other prominent Republicans called for more drastic measures.
""It may be necessary for men and women of principle within the party to set the self-detonation sequence as they escape the ship to a new party,"" wrote conservative blogger Erick Erickson."
Ryan: GOP nominee must reject bigotry,http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--GOP%202016-Congress/id-19fe52e8e09446a1b868b8db10d2e694,ap,3/1/2016 17:27:54,,"House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday anyone who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee must reject any racist group or individual, a tacit swipe at GOP front-runner Donald Trump.
As voters in 11 states holding GOP contests headed to the polls on Super Tuesday, Ryan told reporters that the GOP is the party of President Abraham Lincoln and ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices."" At the same time, Ryan reiterated that he will support the eventual GOP nominee.
Ryan was apparently referring to Trump's appearance Sunday on CNN when he declined to disavow the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and other white supremacists.
""When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up. So today I want to be very clear about something: If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican party there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry,"" Ryan said.
Trump subsequently disavowed Duke, blaming his interview performance Sunday on a bad earpiece.
But the episode provided fodder for candidates such as Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who said on Sunday that ""not only is that wrong, it makes him unelectable.""
Rubio quickly pounced on Trump's comments, saying the GOP ""cannot be a party who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.""
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called Trump's comments ""Really sad.""
""You're better than this,"" Cruz wrote on Twitter. ""We should all agree, racism is wrong, KKK is abhorrent.""
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi argued that ""Trump's radical agenda"" reflects the House Republican conference. Pelosi said that while some in the GOP are distancing themselves from Trump, Republicans refused to remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds and have blocked renewal of the Voting Rights Act.
""The reality is, Donald Trump is just being more candid about the agenda of discrimination House Republicans have been advancing for years,"" Pelosi said in a statement.
On Tuesday, USA Today reported that a group of about 30 African-American students from Valdosta State University were kicked out of a Trump rally by law enforcement officials.
""The only reason we were given was that Mr. Trump did not want us there,"" 22-year-old senior Brooke Gladney told the newspaper. The campaign denied any role in their ouster from the event.
Ryan bemoaned the current discourse in the GOP and said it was time to get back to focusing on how Republicans would solve the nation's problems.
""We are the party of Lincoln,"" Ryan added. ""We believe all people are created in the eyes of God and our government. This is fundamental. And if someone wants to be our nominee they must understand this.""
Ryan was the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2012. He said he has tried to avoid commenting on the presidential race but felt a need to speak up.
""I try to stay out of the day-to-day ups and downs of the primary,"" Ryan said. ""But I've said when I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up.""
Many Washington Republicans are increasingly open about their dismay at the prospect of Trump winning the GOP nomination. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., an advocate of updating U.S. immigration law, said the prospect of voting for Trump is ""not a pleasant thought at all .... I'm still holding out hope we don't have that choice."""
"Super Tuesday: Clinton, Trump look to pull away from rivals",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election%20Rdp/id-3c3eb1f1849d435089d2666ac648dcd1,ap,3/1/2016 9:27:43,,"Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton are eyeing an opportunity to pull away from their rivals on Super Tuesday, a delegate-rich dash across the country that could accelerate their march toward the general election.
Voters from Vermont to Colorado, Alaska to American Samoa and a host of states in between were heading to polling places and caucus sites on the busiest day of the 2016 primaries.
The contests come at a turbulent moment for Republicans as they grapple with the prospect of Trump becoming the party's nominee. Rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are engaged in a frantic effort to stop the billionaire  with Rubio in particular lobbing surprisingly personal attacks  but it was unclear whether they'd made their move too late.
""This is a movement,"" Trump told supporters at a rally Monday evening in Georgia. ""I'm just a messenger, folks.""
Like Trump, Clinton has won three of the four early voting contests, including a thrashing of rival Bernie Sanders in South Carolina on Saturday. Her victory there was due to overwhelming support from black voters, putting her in position for a strong showing in several Southern states with large African-American electorates that vote Tuesday.
Clinton has increasingly turned her attention to Trump in recent days, casting herself as a civil alternative to the insults and bullying that have consumed the Republican race.
""What we can't let happen is the scapegoating, the flaming, the finger pointing that is going on the Republican side,"" she told voters gathered in Springfield, Massachusetts. ""It really undermines our fabric as a nation. So, I want to do everything I can in this campaign to set us on a different course.""
Sanders, who has energized young voters with his call for a political revolution, was seeking to stay close to Clinton in the South and pick up victories in states including Minnesota and his home state of Vermont. But Sanders faces tough questions about whether he can rally minorities that are core Democratic voters.
Democrats will vote in 11 states and American Samoa on Tuesday, with 865 delegates up for grabs. Republicans will vote in 11 states, with 595 delegates at stake.
Trump was seeking to sweep the South, which would be a massive blow for Cruz. The Texas senator, a favorite of the region's social conservatives and evangelical Christians, expected the South to be his firewall, but now is simply hoping to emerge with a victory in his home state.
Rubio's goal on Super Tuesday is even more modest. He's seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count and hopes to pull off a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.
The Florida senator has cast himself as Republicans' best chance to win in a general election and has received a flood of endorsements from GOP officials after other more mainstream candidates dropped out. But he's failed to win a state so far, raising questions about his strategy for topping Trump.
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Now party leaders are divided between those who pledge to fall in line behind Trump if he wins their party's nomination and others who insist they can never back him.
An Associated Press survey of GOP senators and governors across the country showed just under half of respondents would not commit to backing Trump if he's the nominee. Their reluctance foreshadowed a potentially extraordinary split in the party this fall.
""If he becomes the nominee the Democrats are going to savage him, no question about it,"" GOP Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said. His Republican colleague from Arizona, Jeff Flake, said he was ""still holding out hope"" that he wouldn't have to make the choice about supporting Trump.
The worries among Republicans appeared to grow after Trump briefly refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke during a television interview. Trump said he had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and he did later repudiate him.
""Clearly that's caused a lot of concern,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, one of the lawmakers who would back Trump as the nominee. ""We've got about two weeks to find out whether he's going to continue his juggernaut or whether somebody else in going to pull into the pole position. But right now it looks like it's his to lose.""
States holding voting contests in both parties Tuesday are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Republicans vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad."
Talking Trump and barbecue on Super Tuesday,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/4e67281c3f754d0696fbfdee0f3f1469/Article_2016-03-01-US--GOP%202016-Super%20Tuesday-Media/id-2e310c1a964d44939c9a8e66d48d1317,ap,3/2/2016 4:56:22,,"Here's a look at highlights from television coverage of Super Tuesday voting in the presidential campaign:
___
TRUMP'S PODIUM
The broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC gave the campaign an hour of prime-time coverage, and Donald Trump put pressure on them right away.
Trump has dominated coverage almost since his announcement last summer, and was in the midst of a hybrid news conference and victory speech in Florida at 10 p.m. ET when the broadcast networks began their election specials.
That forced the networks to decide how much time they spent to giving an overview of the night, or whether they should train their cameras on the ratings magnet Trump. Of the three, CBS spent the most time on Trump as he spoke live and ABC resisted.
Trump's strategy Tuesday melted some hearts. On NBC, analysts Nicolle Wallace and Eugene Robinson both said his decision not to give a traditional speech to supporters was designed to make him look more reasonable, even presidential, to doubters. Wallace, a former spokeswoman for President George W. Bush, has been a harsh critic of Trump.
""Tonight was an improvement over the last seven days,"" she said.
___
CRUZ VS RUBIO
Republican runners-up Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio chose two different television platforms to speak to the nation.
Cruz timed his speech to supporters for the 10 p.m. hour when the broadcast networks were on the air for their specials, but they didn't cover him. Instead, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC all aired his speech live.
While he was talking, Rubio made the rounds of the broadcast networks, giving one-on-one interviews to ABC, CBS and NBC to spin his rough night. It wasn't easy: On CBS, Charlie Rose's first question was ""Are you getting out of the race?"" Lester Holt on NBC began by asking, ""Are you disheartened?"" and ABC's George Stephanopoulos pointed out, ""You're still without a win. How can you get the nomination?""
Earlier, Fox News pulled away from live coverage of Rubio's speech to supporters for a studio discussion of whether it was time for him to get out of the race. CNN ignored Rubio's speech.
___
TALKING TRUMP
Megyn Kelly and media analyst Howard Kurtz spent time on Fox News discussing whether the media had been fair in spending so much time covering Donald Trump during the campaign at the expense of time spent on other candidates.
As they talked, half of Fox's screen showed an empty stage at Trump's Florida headquarters, over the headline, ""Awaiting news conference from Donald Trump.""
Over on NBC, Lester Holt and Savannah Guthrie discussed how much the prospect of electing the first woman president played into Hillary Clinton's campaign.
""Like everything else in this campaign, it's been overtaken by events,"" Guthrie said. ""And by events, I mean Donald Trump.""
___
FEELING NO BERN
Fox News Channel is not feeling the Bern.
Along with CNN and MSNBC, Fox covered Democrat Bernie Sanders when he took the stage in his home state of Vermont to speak to supporters. But only briefly. Fox cut away from Sanders' speech at 7:33 p.m. ET, while CNN and MSNBC stayed with him until the speech ended 10 minutes later.
It wasn't like there was a lot going on. Polls were still open in most of the states that were voting at the time. Instead of showing Sanders, Fox cut to an empty stage at Ted Cruz's headquarters in Texas, and interviewed conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer and the author of the book, ""Hands Off My Gun.""

MOUTH WATERING
Brian Williams of MSNBC seemed jealous of colleague Chris Matthews' assignment reporting from a Texas roadhouse.
""Help a brother out,"" Williams implored. ""Please FedEx some pulled pork, corned bread and beans. I'd appreciate it very much."""
Trump a fixture in Super Tuesday presidential advertising,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US-GOP-2016-Trump-Ads/id-60fd3ab0258b42ed9666781e16a6ff3c,ap,3/1/2016 19:27:39,,"Donald Trump won't let anyone forget he's running for president. And over the airwaves, neither will his opponents.
In the lead-up to the Super Tuesday primary contests, more than half of all broadcast television ad spots aired in the Republican presidential race feature the controversial billionaire, an Associated Press analysis of campaign ad data found.
Overall, anti-Trump ads outnumber pro-Trump ads on broadcast airwaves nearly 3-to-1, the data show. Trump has spent about $1.4 million to air three ads that portray him positively, but groups opposing him have poured at least $5 million into at least 13 different attack ads.
The XXX analyzed broadcast and national cable TV ads aired between Feb. 21 and Feb. 28 using data from Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. The data do not include ads aired on local cable or satellite TV.
""The cumulative impact of the advertising and the candidates now taking on Trump will be to expose him for the fraud that he is,"" said Katie Packer, who is leading a super political action committee dedicated to stopping Trump. Packer's group, called Our Principles, spent mostly on cable ahead of Super Tuesday.
The Republican ad that's aired more than any other since Trump's South Carolina victory 10 days ago shows a wildly-gesturing Trump and tags him as ""erratic, unreliable."" The ad paid for by the Marco Rubio-aligned Conservative Solutions PAC has aired more than 2,300 times, with its heaviest rotation in Tennessee and Oklahoma, two of the 11 states that weigh in on the Republican race Tuesday.
That commercial also dubs Rubio opponent Ted Cruz, a Texas senator, ""calculated, underhanded,"" before turning to Rubio as the clear choice.
Cruz hammers Trump in two of his campaign ads on the air now.
One commercial airing in Arkansas and Oklahoma begins with a clip of a Trump on Fox News saying, ""I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to.""  Text overlay notes, ""That's for sure."" The ad goes on to highlight Trump comments on abortion, Planned Parenthood and Hillary Clinton that Republican voters might not like.
A different Cruz ad reminds viewers that the next president will likely pick a new Supreme Court justice and that Trump hasn't been uniformly opposed to abortion.
The Cruz-backing outside group Stand for Truth has also gotten in on the Trump bashing.
An ad airing in Tennessee, Oklahoma and Arkansas mostly touts Cruz while taking a brief swipe at Trump, running his photo in a montage with Democrats Clinton and Bernie Sanders. A narrator says, ""We can't afford to take a chance on this election.""
But Trump is rebuffing the attacks with three different campaign ads of his own. One returns fire at Cruz, calling him ""the worst kind of Washington insider, who just can't be trusted."" That is up exclusively in Cruz's home state, which the candidate has identified as a must-win.
Trump's top-broadcast ad in the past 10 days also is on air in Texas, along with Arkansas, Virginia and Tennessee.
The spot features a montage of Trump speaking in front of crowds while people who attended those rallies praise his ability to ""speak the truth"" and ""tell it like it is."" The ad ends with Trump giving a thumbs-up while audio of a stump speech plays in which he says his campaign slogan, ""We will make America great again.""
The Club for Growth begs to differ. The outside group's political arm, Club for Growth Action, is back on the air in a handful of Super Tuesday states after spending $2.5 million hitting Trump ahead of voting in Iowa and South Carolina.
""Trump wants us to think he's Mr. Tell-It-Like-It-Is, but he has a record, and it's very liberal,"" a deep-voiced narrator says in the Club for Growth ad before landing a near-rhyming blow: ""He's really just playing us for chumps.""
Yet for all the Trump attack ads up now, Packer says she doesn't expect them to make a difference on Tuesday.
That's because Packer and the leaders of other outside groups that are increasingly training their fire on Trump say they're just getting started.
Her group, Our Principles, plans to spend more than $1 million in the coming weeks airing an ad that features people who attended Trump University with little to show for it.
Another outside group, American Future Fund, says it also is beginning a ""multimillion-dollar"" anti-Trump television effort on Tuesday. The group, which does not disclose its donors, has been attracting backers who its spokesman, Stuart Roy, says have recently come to the realization that Trump is ""dangerously close"" to locking up the GOP presidential nomination.
""Pocketbooks have loosened up in recent days and weeks,"" Roy said. ""But if the question is, 'Will it be enough to stop him?' The answer is, 'It's getting a little late in the game.'""

Trump looks to extend dominance as GOP starts to panic,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016%20Election-GOP/id-1345a650bb4244f3b8880be2be5584ed,ap,3/1/2016 20:58:26,," (AP)  Donald Trump looks to extend his dominance as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio scramble for delegates in presidential primary contests across 11 states on a Super Tuesday, stained by panic from Republican leaders even before the results were known.
Fearing a Trump sweep, Republican officials across the nation lashed out at the billionaire businessman's temperament and command of the issues in the hours before voting began. Having won three consecutive primary elections, Trump was poised to tighten his grasp on the GOP nomination in primary elections from Georgia to Massachusetts and Texas to Arkansas.
""These are challenging times for the Republican Party,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who wanted to stay neutral in the GOP primary but endorsed Rubio last week. ""Those that care deeply, as myself, probably should have been engaged earlier in trying to show that Donald Trump is not the right one to lead the conservative movement and to lead our party.""
The comments came during a wild prelude to Super Tuesday that featured a dispute over the Klu Klux Klan, a violent clash between a photographer and a secret service agent, and extraordinary criticism from several Republican governors and senators who refused to say whether they would support their party's front-runner should Trump win the nomination.
A confident Trump brushed off his critics on Tuesday morning, suggesting that he's helping to grow the party and even attracting Democrats to the GOP.
""We're getting people into the party that they've never had before,"" he told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ''I can tell you the one person Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against is me.""
Trump was seeking to sweep a series of contests across the South, which would be a massive blow for Cruz, in particular. The Texas senator, a favorite of the region's social conservatives and evangelical Christians, long expected the South to be his firewall, but now simply hopes to emerge with a victory in his home state.
Rubio's goal on Super Tuesday is even more modest. He's seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count while eyeing a win in his home state of Florida on March 15. Republican officials have rallied behind Rubio over the last week, but he's failed to win a single state so far and could very well continue the winless streak on Tuesday.
The junior senator from Florida was in Minnesota on Tuesday warning voters of consequences to electing an outspoken celebrity. Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler-turned-governor of Minnesota, told XXX this week that he'd consider a third-party White House run if Rubio or Hillary Clinton are the party nominees because he doesn't ""want the revolution to die.""
""Jesse Ventura was an embarrassment,"" Rubio proclaimed to the crowd in Andover. ""Let me rephrase that: Jesse Ventura is an embarrassment.""
Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson remain in the race, but neither is expected to be a major factor on Super Tuesday.
With some fearing Trump's delegate lead could become insurmountable by the middle of the month, the best hope for Rubio, Cruz and Kasich could be a contested national convention in July. But even that could be optimistic should Trump continue to dominate.
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Now party leaders are divided between those who pledge to fall in line behind Trump if he wins their party's nomination and others who insist they can never back him.
An Associated Press survey of GOP senators and governors across the country showed just under half of respondents would not commit to backing Trump if he's the nominee. Their reluctance foreshadowed a potentially extraordinary split in the party this fall.
""Right now we are in a very dangerous place,"" said former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman.
""You've got a con man and a bully who is moving forward with great speed to grab the party's mantle to be its standard bearer,"" Coleman, who backs Rubio, said in an interview with XXX. ""That's almost incomprehensible."""

The two front-runners, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, hope Super Tuesday is definitive for them  signaling the inevitability of their march toward the party nominations.
Clinton challenger Bernie Sanders and Trump rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are desperate to drag out the drama a little longer.
A guide on what to watch for as voters in a dozen states register their preferences Tuesday night:
THE TIMELINE
If vote margins aren't too tight, expect rolling waves of race calls as polls close in various states: Georgia, Virginia and Vermont at 7 p.m. EST; Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Massachusetts at 8 p.m.; Arkansas at 8:30 p.m.; Texas, Minnesota and Colorado at 9 p.m.; Alaska at midnight. A big chunk of the electorate votes early in Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, and those early votes will show up quickly in the count, increasing the chances for fast calls in those states. Sorry Sanders, your home state of Vermont tends to be slow to report. And Minnesota, Colorado and Alaska are caucus states that could experience more hiccups than state-run primary states.
Caucuses are local meetings of registered party members organized by the state party. Primaries, on the other hand, are run by the state government and are done by secret ballot at polling stations, similar to the general election.
___
DEMOCRATIC DEMOGRAPHICS
Watch how Clinton does with minority voters across the South and beyond. If she can replicate the resounding support that she got from black voters in South Carolina, where she was favored by 9 in 10 African Americans, she'll be well situated to nail the nomination. Watch how Sanders does among young-ish voters  not just the youngest. He lost every age group but the under-30 crowd in South Carolina, which is not a big enough slice of the population to get him to a balloon drop at the Democratic Convention.
___
CRUZ'S CROWN JEWEL
It's all about Texas for Cruz. After three straight third-place finishes in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, the Texas senator most likely couldn't survive a Super Tuesday embarrassment on his home turf. A big chunk of that Texas vote already is just waiting to be counted: More than 1.7 million voters cast early ballots in the state, representing 12 percent of registered voters in the two parties and about 7 percent of registered Republicans. Even if Cruz wins the state, he's not guaranteed all 155 GOP delegates; the state awards them proportionally.
___
SILVER LININGS
With Trump poised for a big Republican delegate haul, his GOP rivals will be searching for any shreds of encouraging news to justify remaining in the race. Can Rubio point to increased margins of support even if he doesn't win anywhere? Will Cruz be celebrating increased strength among evangelicals, from whom Trump has been siphoning support? Can also-rans John Kasich and Ben Carson find anything  seriously, anything  to smile about?
___
SOUTHERN COMFORT
With seven Southern states casting ballots, it's time to see if Clinton can erect the much-talked-of southern firewall. If Sanders can't show strength beyond his Northeast home base in Vermont and neighboring Massachusetts, he'll know he's in big trouble.
___
GOING GENERAL?
Check out the election-night speeches by Clinton and Trump. Do they pivot from their primary election rivals and point themselves toward a potential general-election matchup?
___
SOFT SPOTS
Exit poll data will offer fresh clues about the candidates' potential soft spots. Does Clinton continue to have trouble with voters who place a premium on honesty? Does Trump keep falling short of Rubio among GOP voters who want a candidate who can win in November?
___
THE MATH
In the end, it's all about the delegates. And about a quarter of them, awarded proportionally, are decided on Super Tuesday. Trump came into Super Tuesday with 82, Cruz, 18, Rubio 16, Kasich 6 and Carson 4. It takes 1,237 to win the GOP nomination. Clinton entered Super Tuesday with 546 delegates  including superdelegates, the party leaders and members of Congress who can support any candidate. Sanders had 87. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination."
"Viewer's Guide: After Super Tuesday, cold hard delegate math",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election-Watching%20Wednesday/id-47d1f32acbbb451f94e993eb238f02af,ap,3/2/2016 4:19:38,,"Presidential candidates will wake up Wednesday morning to the cold, hard truth of delegate math. It might give the front-runners some breathing room, but for the rest of the field the truth may hurt.
What to watch for on the day after Super Tuesday doles out a quarter of all the delegates at stake in the GOP and Democratic nominating contests:
THE TALLY: With 12 states awarding delegates, see how the delegate totals stack up when the dust settles.
With results in some states still in flux, Donald Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday delegates and Ted Cruz at least 52. Marco Rubio had won at least 25 delegates, John Kasich 13 and Ben Carson two. There were 595 GOP delegates at stake in 11 states.
Overall, Trump led with 221 delegates, Cruz 69, Rubio, 41. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president.
On the Democratic side, Clinton was assured of winning at least 334 of the 865 delegates at stake on Super Tuesday. Sanders was sure to get at least 145. Including superdelegates, Clinton had at least 882 delegates. Sanders had at least 232. It takes 2,383 Democratic delegates to win.
GENERALLY SPEAKING: Watch how front-runners Clinton and Trump position themselves going forward. Do they focus more on their primary election rivals or pivot toward an anticipated general election matchup? Trump said Tuesday night that if Clinton hadn't straightened out Washington by now ""she isn't going to straighten it out in the next four years."" Clinton, in turn, criticized what she called the angry, divisive rhetoric from the Republican front-runner, though she did not name him.
The B-WORD: Trump's strong showing could generate fresh talk about the possibility of a brokered convention from Republicans who just can't get on board with the idea of Trump as the eventual GOP nominee.
RUBIO'S ROAD: Rubio's itinerary reflects his priorities. He campaigns Wednesday in Michigan, which votes March 8. And he's already putting big effort into his home state of Florida, which votes with a number of winner-take-all-delegates states on March 15. Early voting already has started in Florida, and Rubio has been unequivocal about its importance to him, saying:  ""We're going to win Florida. Florida is not going to vote for a con artist like Donald Trump.""
CRUZ'S COURSE:  Watch for a more aggressive Cruz, rejuvenated by victories in his home state of Texas and neighboring Oklahoma. Stressing that he's the only candidate with victories over Trump so far, Cruz on Tuesday night urged the other GOP candidates to ""prayerfully consider coming together"" and uniting against Trump. Translation: get out of the race.
GOP SOUL-SEARCHING: Keep an eye on how the GOP establishment does  or doesn't  reconcile itself to Trump. In the run-up to Tuesday's mega-round of voting, some establishment figures were vowing they'd never, ever support Trump; others were reluctantly pledging to fall in line behind the eventual nominee, whoever it is.
AM NOT, DID TOO: The rhetoric in the GOP race took a turn for the worse before Super Tuesday, featuring a series of taunts between Trump and Rubio about potential pants-wetting, bad spray tans and overactive sweat glands. Do the candidates elevate the conversation once Tuesday's big vote is past?
SANDERS' STAND: Sanders, looking for someplace to shine after wins in Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont, planned to talk strategy over breakfast Wednesday before campaigning in Maine and Michigan, where he hopes his populist message will resonate with union and blue-collar voters.
ENTHUSIASM GAP?  Check out final turnout figures from Tuesday. The first two primary states to vote  New Hampshire and South Carolina  turned out record numbers of Republican, but not Democratic, voters. If that trend continues, it could have implications for the general election.
AIR WARS: Expect to see lots of Trump thumping in the next two weeks. Ahead of Super Tuesday, anti-Trump ads outnumbered pro-Trump commercials nearly 3-to-1. That ratio is likely to grow. Three outside groups, Our Principles, American Future Fund and Club for Growth, have laid plans for millions of dollars in new Trump attack ads. Conservative Solutions, a super political action committee backing Rubio - and blasting Trump -- has reserved $6 million of ad time for in the soon-to-vote states of Michigan, Illinois, Missouri and Florida. On the Democratic side, Clinton and Sanders both continue their campaign advertising. From the looks of the ad reservations, Sanders is betting big on Michigan, spending more than two-thirds of future ad money there."

That doesn't mean they'll stop trying.
What to watch for Wednesday, the day after Trump claimed another seven states in the Super Tuesday mega-vote, and Clinton widened her lead over Sanders with seven more of her own:
___
THE TALLY: With 12 states awarding delegates Tuesday, see how the delegate totals shake out.
Trump has amassed 285 delegates, Ted Cruz 161, and Marco Rubio, 87. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination.
On the Democratic side, Clinton had at least 1,005 delegates, Sanders 373. It takes 2,383 Democratic delegates to win.
___
GENERALLY SPEAKING: Watch front-runners Clinton and Trump spar from afar in an anticipated general election matchup. Trump said Tuesday night that if Clinton hasn't straightened out Washington by now ""she isn't going to straighten it out in the next four years."" Clinton, in turn, criticized what she called the angry, divisive rhetoric from the Republican front-runner, though she did not name him.
___
CRUZ'S COURSE: Watch for a more assertive Cruz, rejuvenated by victories in his home state of Texas and neighboring Oklahoma. On Tuesday night he urged the other GOP candidates to ""prayerfully consider coming together"" and uniting against Trump. Translation: Get out of the race.
___
RUBIO'S ROAD: After a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday, expect Rubio to be all-in for his home turf of Florida, a winner-take-all state that votes March 15. And he'll campaign Wednesday in Michigan, which votes March 8. Rubio, who won Minnesota on Tuesday, is still betting his more aggressive approach to Trump will pay off.
___
GOP SOUL-SEARCHING: Keep an eye on how the GOP establishment does  or doesn't  reconcile itself to Trump. In the run-up to Tuesday's mega-round of voting, some establishment figures were vowing they'd never, ever support Trump; others were reluctantly pledging to fall in line behind the eventual nominee, whoever it is. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, no fan of Cruz, lamented Tuesday night that ""we may be in a position where rallying around Ted Cruz is the only way to stop Donald Trump and I'm not so sure that would work.""
___
THE B-WORD: Trump's strong showing could generate fresh talk about the possibility of a so-called ""brokered convention"" from Republicans who just can't get on board with the idea of Trump as the eventual GOP nominee.
___
AM NOT, DID TOO: The rhetoric in the GOP race took a turn for the worse before Super Tuesday, featuring a series of taunts between Trump and Rubio about potential pants-wetting, bad spray tans and overactive sweat glands. Do the candidates elevate the conversation now that Tuesday's big vote is past?
___
SANDERS' STAND: Sanders, looking for more places to shine after wins in Oklahoma, Colorado, Minnesota and his home state of Vermont, was ready to campaign Wednesday in Maine and Michigan, where he hopes his populist message will resonate with union and blue-collar voters. And his campaign strategists scheduled a ""path forward"" breakfast to lay out his intended route to the nomination.
___
ENTHUSIASM GAP?  Check out final turnout figures from Tuesday's primaries, which showed record voting among Republican, but not Democratic, voters. If that trend continues, it could have implications for the general election. And expect Trump to take credit for it: He held out high turnout on Super Tuesday as evidence he's expanding the Republican Party.

Voices of voters as they cast ballots on Super Tuesday,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016%20Election-Voter%20Voices/id-87d62cfbd9044e72a05c7d0aa2d99881,ap,3/2/2016 5:18:43,,"Twelve states in all cast votes for presidential nominees on March 1, also known as Super Tuesday, the biggest single-day delegate haul of the nomination contests. Republicans are voting in 11 states, with 595 delegates at stake. Democrats are casting ballots in 11 states, too, plus American Samoa, with 865 delegates up for grabs.
Here's a look at what some voters had to say as they went to the polls Tuesday:
___
Jan Kearns, a special education teacher originally from Canada, recently became a U.S. citizen and was voting in her first presidential election. Experience was a key factor in her decision to support Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.
Kearns admires Clinton's stance on equal pay for women and says she knows how government works. She agreed with a lot of Sanders' positions but questioned whether he could succeed as president.
""He's a little too earthy, crunchy for the way Washington works,"" she said after voting in Framingham, Massachusetts.
___
Dormetra Henry, a 50-year-old clerical worker from Houston, said for her it was a toss-up between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump but that in the end, it was her faith that helped her decide to vote for Cruz.
""We're deeply religious and I believe Ted Cruz, he has a heart for the Lord. I believe that he is a Christian,"" said Henry, who is nondenominational but was previously Catholic.
Henry said while she had her doubts about Trump's Christian values, she still admires his strong personality.
""He says whatever he wants to say, and he doesn't really care about any repercussions,"" she said. ""That can be good and bad. You can't go into the presidential office and tell all these other countries, 'We don't care what you do,' and they bomb us. So you have to be careful.""
___
Gloria Pryor-Lewis and her daughter Greta Lewis went to Central Christian Church in Memphis to vote for Hillary Clinton.
Pryor-Lewis, a 63-year-old dentist, said she admires Clinton for being a ""strong woman.""
""Of course, my daughter calls her arrogant,"" she said, getting a laugh out of her 31-year-old daughter, who works as a receptionist in her dental office.
""I do like a strong woman like my mother,"" said Greta Lewis, who praised Clinton for her support of minorities.
""She has been the one who has stepped out to at least try to identify with most of the minorities, whether they're women, black, Asian, Hispanic,"" Greta Lewis said. ""She's the one that has taken the most time to talk about it, to have something to say about it and be firm about it, and know who the leader of the KKK is.""
___
Twin sisters Vivien and Gillian Gattie, both retired, 72 years old and originally from England, were less than thrilled at their options as they showed up to cast ballots at Boston City Hall.
""I'm so appalled at the choices,"" said Gillian, an independent who voted for President Barack Obama twice, but chose a Republican, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, as a ""protest vote"" because she didn't care for any Republican or Democrat this time around.
She said she would only vote for Hillary Clinton in November if it came down to a contest between her and Donald Trump.
Vivien, a registered Democrat who also voted for Obama in the last two presidential elections, cast her ballot for Clinton, though reluctantly.
""I voted for her because I think she can win,"" she said. ""I can't get excited for Bernie Sanders.""
Like her sister, Vivien said she has concerns about Clinton.
""I really don't care for her much. I don't trust her,"" Vivien said. ""But I think she's qualified  the most qualified of the candidates.""
Gillian agreed, adding that Clinton's record as secretary of state and the controversy over her use of personal email for official business blemished her trustworthiness.
___
Retired Marine Corps. Gen. Bill Weise joined about a dozen people waiting patiently in line at the Greenspring precinct in Fairfax County, which traditionally has the highest turnout in Virginia. The precinct is made up entirely of voters from the sprawling Greenspring retirement community.
The 86-year-old Weise says seven months of agonizing over who he'd vote for came down to the final 10 seconds before he filled in the bubble next to Ted Cruz's name. Ben Carson was his favorite candidate, but he concluded Carson wasn't viable. In sorting through the other GOP candidates, Weise felt Cruz would make better decisions than Donald Trump.
""I've read Cruz's autobiography,"" he said. ""He's not perfect. But show me somebody who is. ...The ideal candidate does not exist.""
___
Michael Kernyat of Chesterfield County, Virginia, voted for John Kasich even though he thinks he probably just threw his vote away.
The 60-year-old retired computer consultant said Kasich is ""the most reasonable person running"" but probably has no chance of beating Donald Trump.
""Nobody is going to stop that freight train,"" Kernyat said. ""I think it's going to come down between him and Hillary (Clinton).""
He said people seem to be rallying behind Trump because ""they're tired of politics as usual,"" but he prefers the moderate positions of Kasich.
""The only one who really scares me in this election is Bernie (Sanders),"" Kernyat said.
___
Jim Stephens, a 72-year-old retired pastor from Anchorage, Alaska, supported Marco Rubio.
""I believe of the three main ones, he probably has the best chance of winning against the Democratic person that's running,"" said Stephens, who now works part-time in a hardware store. He and his second wife have five daughters and 13 grandchildren.
Stephens said John Kasich would be his second choice, but he doesn't believe the Ohio governor could win in the general election.
He also had thoughts on how Donald Trump is conducting himself, comparing him to a schoolyard bully.
""I just think that doesn't show the level of stature for a presidential person,"" Stephens said.
___
Jacob Lawrence-Simon, a software developer for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, started his day as a Bernie Sanders volunteer at 4:30 a.m., hanging notices on doors to remind voters to caucus.
Lawrence-Simon, 30, said he supports Sanders because of his views on gay rights, a higher minimum wage and his ""desire to not go to war.""
""I want politicians to try to solve an issue without bombs first ... and I feel like Bernie Sanders better represents that mentality than Hillary Clinton, who seems to be like a bomb-and-fix kind of candidate,"" Lawrence-Simon said.
___
Tyler Murphy, a 26-year-old Boston resident who works as a project manager for a construction company, voted for Donald Trump on Tuesday even though he thinks the billionaire businessman is ""undeniably wrong on a lot of things.""
For better or worse, he said, the controversial candidate is the ""wake-up call"" the country needs.
""Ultimately, if we have to elect someone who is borderline crazy to get people to understand what's going on, then that's what we have to do,"" Murphy said.
An independent, he voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Barack Obama in 2008 and said he's donated to both parties in the past.
Murphy said that if Trump had not become such a viable candidate, he would likely have voted for Hillary Clinton.
""I just don't think she's going to be the person to shake people out of their seats,"" he said. ""She's not what the country needs right now."""
"Winning in Va. and Ga., Clinton looks to solidify her lead",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election-DEM/id-35f4de69943349a0a8bf6f6b68833d8b,ap,3/2/2016 0:51:42,,"Hillary Clinton achieved key victories in Georgia and Virginia to extend her lead over Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who won his home state of Vermont but risks a major setback if he has a poor showing in the rest of the Super Tuesday contests.
Backed by black voters, Clinton aims for a sweep of Southern states holding primaries and polls showed her with a big advantage in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas. Sanders could only bank on the home-state win and both campaigns were vying for support in Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Oklahoma.
As polls closed, Clinton spoke to a forum of black women hosted by the television network BET at the St. Regis hotel in Miami.
""I'm thinking about how we can elevate the political dialogue away from the insults and really mean-spirited language,"" she said.
Clinton and her allies have already shifted some attention to Donald Trump, casting the Republican front-runner as divisive and unprepared to lead the country. The Republican contest, said Clinton, has ""turned into a kind of one-upsmanship on insulting.""
All told, Clinton and Sanders were competing for 865 delegates in 11 states and American Samoa on Tuesday, the biggest single-day prize of the 2016 campaign.
With her victories in Georgia and Virginia, Clinton is assured of at least 108 delegates. Sanders will receive at least 57 from Vermont. Forty-eight remain to be allocated in those three states.
Black voters powered Clinton to victory in South Carolina last weekend and were expected to give her a huge advantage throughout the South.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters in Alabama and Georgia were black, according to early results of exit polls conducted for XXX and television networks. In Texas, about 3 in 10 Democratic primary voters were Hispanic and a little fewer than 2 in 10 were black.
Greta Lewis voted with her mother at the Central Christian Church in Memphis. Both women are black and chose Clinton.
""She has been the one who has stepped out to at least try to identify with most of the minorities, whether they're women, black, Asian, Hispanic,"" said Lewis, a 31-year-old receptionist at her mother's dental office.
Exit polling also showed voters pushing to continue President Barack Obama's policies rather than the kind of leftward shift championed by Sanders.
Clinton entered Tuesday with 546 delegates, including super delegates  the party leaders and members of Congress who can support any candidate. Sanders lags with 87 delegates. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.
Clinton visited Minnesota before heading to Miami, foreshadowing the importance of Florida for the general election.
Sanders decamped to Essex Junction, Vermont. He has vowed to stay in the race until the party's convention  and he showed no signs of retreating as he talked to supporters after the Vermont polls closed about income inequality, government-funded college degrees and criminal justice reform.
""This campaign is not just about electing a president  it is about transforming America,"" Sanders said.
Despite his obstacles, the Vermont senator has little incentive to fold. He reported raising more than $42 million in February, a sign that he will have the money to go deep into the spring."6 takeaways from Super Tuesday,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/super-tuesday-results-recap/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 6:06:47,,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton didn't win their parties' nominations on Super Tuesday -- but they both became much harder to beat. 
Trump racked up wins in seven states to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's two and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's one. And Clinton defeated Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in seven of the 11 Democratic contests.  
Here are six takeaways from the biggest day in the 2016 presidential race so far: 

He proved it in the early states and now he has proven it on Super Tuesday: Donald Trump is leading a coalition.  
New Hampshire and Massachusetts showed he wins white, working-class moderates -- the Reagan Democrats. South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia showed he wins evangelicals in the Bible Belt. And record-shattering Republican turnout in Virginia showed he expands the party's base of voters.  
""I'm a unifier — I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me,"" Trump said. 
Trump is running away with the GOP nomination, as his rivals continue their never-ending fight about who's the best alternative. 
He survived the latest controversy, this one over whether he'd given a subtle wink to white supremacists by deflecting questions about whether he'd disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke in an interview with XXX's Jake Tapper.  
And he bested two opponents who'd devoted an entire two-hour debate Thursday night to dumping their opposition research books on his head.  
After an introduction by former rival and new campaign surrogate New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Trump congratulated Cruz on an ""excellent win"" in Texas before turning his attention to Hillary Clinton. 
""Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again,"" he said, referencing her new attack line.

It's the polar opposite of where Clinton found herself eight years ago. This time, she's ahead in the delegate race and has won a majority of the Democratic contests.  
Clinton won a swath of delegate-rich Southern states with large minority populations, easily besting Sanders in Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas. And she won the night's biggest toss-up, narrowly defeating Sanders in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts win, in particular, showed that it's not just a minority firewall for Clinton -- she can win states that are predominantly white. 
The Democratic nominating contest allocates delegates proportionally, so Clinton hasn't knocked Sanders out of the race.  
But she has a date in mind to do just that: March 15.  
With all of the momentum, Clinton is aiming for wins in a series of big states -- Michigan on March 8 and then Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri on March 15.  
At that point, the scenarios for a Sanders comeback become ""less and less likely,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said -- even though the campaign expects to lose in Kansas, Nebraska and Maine between now and then.

Cruz did exactly what he needed to do: He won his home state of Texas by a resounding margin, and he tacked on Oklahoma -- allowing him to continue his argument that he is the only Republican who can beat Trump.  
In fact, Cruz called on the rest of the GOP field to ""prayerfully"" consider dropping out of the race during his election-night speech.  
""Tonight, this campaign enters a new phase,"" Cruz said. ""Tomorrow morning we have a choice. So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely, and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives and for the nation. And after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
Cruz's comments came before the results were finalized in Minnesota, Rubio's best state.  
And he ignored the reality that there are no real signs the Republican establishment likes him any more than Trump.  
But in the GOP primary right now, when Cruz or Rubio rises, the other falls -- and Cruz had the better night Tuesday.  
On the other hand: Cruz had pegged his entire campaign to Super Tuesday, calling it the most important date in the race. He once used the word ""firewall"" to describe it -- a fact Rubio's campaign has gleefully trumpeted. Yet he only won two states, and many of the Southern states he banked on previously have now already voted.

Rubio has defended his string of second and third-place finishes by arguing he has a path to victory that focuses on the post-Super Tuesday states, including his native Florida. 
He finally got on the board Tuesday, winning the Minnesota caucuses. 
But overall, the night was another disappointment for Rubio, who spent much of the past week unleashing a barrage of Trump-like attacks against the billionaire businessman. 
Now, Rubio has to explain, again, to donors and power brokers why he's worth a major investment. His argument: The race now goes to Michigan, and then five bigger states with more moderate, suburban, highly educated Republicans -- places he can win. Florida is one of them, and it's winner-take-all.  
""That's where we're really going to catch fire,"" Rubio told XXX's Jake Tapper in a Tuesday night interview.  
Trump and Cruz, meanwhile, are happy to tell Rubio that he's finished. 
""He had a tough night. He is a lightweight,"" Trump said.  
And he's ready to put Rubio away, saying, ""We're gonna spend a lot of time in Florida.""

The Democratic night largely followed expectations, with Sanders picking up wins in Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Vermont.  
The only other state where he stood a real chance was Massachusetts, a liberal stronghold bordering his native Vermont. But he was unable to win there, or dent Clinton's momentum elsewhere on the map. 
Speaking early in the night, Sanders made the argument that he's racking up nearly as many delegates as Clinton -- so there's no reason for him to consider looking for the exits any time soon.  
""This is not a general election; it's not winner-take-all,"" Sanders told his adoring crowd. ""If you get 52%, you get 48%, you roughly end up with the same amount of delegates in a state. By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates."" 
There's no reason Sanders can't stay competitive: He raised $42 million in February alone, giving him plenty of cash to match or outspend Clinton on the airwaves.  
Sanders has another particularly useful tool in his pocket: More Democratic debates, starting Sunday night in Flint, Michigan.  
Clinton agreed to them as Sanders was gaining momentum nationally. Now, though, they serve to extend the life of a race that Clinton's campaign would prefer to bring to an effective end as soon as possible.  
Michigan votes next Tuesday -- and it'll be a precursor for the following week's Ohio primary. Those now look like states Sanders needs to win.  

There's a reason John Kasich is facing calls from Republicans to get out of the race: he's a spoiler to candidates trying to topple Trump.
In Virginia, for instance, Kasich took 9.4%, and Rubio lost to Trump by 2.8%.  
""We basically fought Donald Trump to a draw. And had it been a narrower field, we would have won Virginia,"" Rubio said on XXX Tuesday night.
Expect a chorus of party brass to press Kasich to depart before Ohio's March 15 winner-take-all primary. If Rubio could win both Florida and Ohio on that day, he'd gain 165 delegates in one fell swoop.  
But with Kasich in the race, that won't happen.  
Kasich isn't inclined to help Rubio. His campaign argues that it's Rubio who is underperforming expectations -- spoiling, for example, what would've been a Kasich win in Vermont.  
Dr. Ben Carson, too, is refusing to exit the race -- and while he's hardly racking up any delegates, he's a thorn in the side of Cruz.
Carson performs best among evangelical voters. That's Cruz's strong suit, too. While it's not clear where Carson's support would go, Cruz could have figured to pick up the largest share of it -- giving him a boost in Southern states.

"After GOP establishment 'froze' on Trump, Democrats ready battle plans",http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-democrats-election-2016/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 4:20:46,,"As Donald Trump seems poised for a huge night Tuesday, Democrats see his stunning ascent and controversial, celebrity-driven business empire as a golden opportunity. 
""Those bankruptcies screwed a lot of people -- and not just hedge fund yuppies,"" said a top strategist aligned with a pro-Clinton super PAC. ""His idea of 'winning' has involved a lot of bad behavior -- and the victims are exactly the profile of Trump voters: blue-collar whites.""
For months, key campaign operatives inside the Republican Party establishment were supremely confident that Trump would implode long before this moment. Instead, the GOP is now facing an existential crisis not seen in more than a generation as much of the party leadership and many of its top figures are in open revolt against Trump's candidacy heading into Super Tuesday.
The potential liabilities lurking in Trump's background are hardly a secret. The real estate magnate's occasional business failings and colorful personal life have filled the pages of New York tabloids for decades.
Storing its ammunition for the general election, one pro-Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has taken a few jabs at Trump, choosing instead to portray the businessman as a reflection of the Republican Party.
""Trump is no fluke. Nor is he hijacking the Republican Party or the conservative movement,"" wrote Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky in an email to reporters. ""He is, rather, the party's creation, its Frankenstein monster.""
A Trump rival, Marco Rubio, has only recently decided to tap that treasure trove of opposition research. That offensive, however, only began in earnest at last week's Republican debate as Rubio mocked Trump's inheritance and legal troubles facing the real estate academy launched by his the tycoon's vast organization.
The Democrats' looming business boogeyman assault on Trump is nearly identical to the attack leveled at the last GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, whose financial firm Bain Capital was savaged by pro-Obama super PACs over its practice of downsizing manufacturers for profit.
Inside the pro-Clinton super PAC-world, the Republican establishment's miscalculation is viewed as a tactical error of epic proportions.
""Amazing. They just froze,"" the PAC aligned strategist said, requesting anonymity.
No candidacy better illustrates GOP's painful lesson, in the minds of several top GOP advisers, than that of Jeb Bush. 
As Trump delighted in pointing out at every one of his rallies, the former Florida governor and his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, both amassed a war chest capable of annihilating any potential rival. But instead of directing that arsenal at Trump, Bush and his allies chose to target fellow establishment figures, especially Rubio.
""The civilized world raised an army and entrusted it to Right to Rise PAC,"" said Stuart Stevens, Romney's former campaign manager. ""Instead of fighting barbarians, they decided to try and kill everybody who agrees with them. Crazy. Just crazy.""
""The Right to Rise thing is historically bad,"" he added.
Stevens, a key figure in Romney's political world, has brutally attacked the GOP front-runner on Twitter. 
""It's becoming obvious that supporting or not supporting (Trump) isn't a political choice. It's a moral choice. The man is evil,"" he said.
Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, brushed off the party's concerns about his candidate. 
""I worry about everything,"" Lewandowski quipped. 
Rubio's calculated, yet harsh attack on Trump came only hours after Romney challenged the billionaire businessman to release his tax returns. Trump responded with a slew of insults aimed at Romney on Friday, remarking that the former Massachusetts governor had no hopes of winning in 2012 because he ""walked like a duck.""
On Monday, Romney tweeted that Trump's inability to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan on XXX's ""State of the Union"" as disqualifying.
As for Bush, he was hardly the only candidate to engage in Trump denial. 
Ted Cruz, who has also raised a vast fortune in contributions, studiously avoided contact with the GOP front-runner for much of 2015, hopeful that Trump would self-destruct and releasing his angry anti-establishment electorate in search of safe harbor. 
The famously tough-talking Chris Christie grumbled to reporters time and again that he would not attack Trump, only doing so before dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor is now arguably Trump's most senior establishment supporter.
Also underestimated was the anger brewing on the margins of the American economic recovery. Working-class voters who are simply too conservative to support a self-declared democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders are flocking to Trump's message that illegal immigration and bad trade deals are decimating the heartland.
Trump has dubbed these boisterous followers, who stuff themselves into arenas and auditoriums, the ""noisy majority."" 
And while they may actually have the energy and enthusiasm to sweep Trump and the Republican Party back into the White House, many in the GOP hierarchy are predicting easy pickings for Democrats and associated super PACs come November.
Another top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, sees the rise of Trump as a logical extension of the tea party movement, which is highly capable of putting conservatives in Congress, but is a turnoff to more moderate, suburban voters in presidential elections. 
""This is the natural consequence of 2009 and 2010,"" said the strategist. ""We co-opted a movement made up largely of the least informed voters. We got significant short-term political gain, but in the process empowered a group that has little interest in reason.""
""We reap what we sow,"" the strategist said.
Trump is equally disdainful of his Republican critics. The celebrity magnate, who authored ""The Art of the Deal,"" routinely lambastes GOP leaders in Congress over the recent budget deal with the White House. Trump insists he will broker better agreements as president by simply walking away from the negotiating table when necessary.
At times, Trump has sought to ease tensions within the Republican Party over his superheated rhetoric on immigration. He often highlights his standing in the polls with Latino voters and praises the Hispanic employees who work at his hotels.
But senior GOP advisers privately worry the damage is done.
""The bubble will crash at some point, but I fear we will be tatters by the time it does,"" one top Republican congressional aide said.

Ben Carson skipping GOP debate,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/ben-carson-doesnt-see-a-political-path-forward-wont-go-to-debate/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 19:18:26,,"Ben Carson doesn't ""see a political path forward"" in the Republican presidential nomination process, and will not attend Thursday's GOP presidential debate in his hometown of Detroit, he said in a statement.
The retired neurosurgeon and his aides reached the decision after a staff meeting Wednesday morning in Baltimore after a disappointing finish on Super Tuesday.  
Carson said he's not planning on formally suspending his presidential campaign and will go into more detail during an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Committee Conference near Washington on Friday. 
But it appears to end what once seemed like a promising campaign for the first-time political candidate. He was the first GOP candidate to overtake Donald Trump in the polls for a period of several weeks around October 2015. But as fall turned to winter, Carson consistently lost ground to Trump and later Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
Republican operatives, looking to move Carson out of the race as they try to remove obstacles to finding a challenger to Donald Trump, were planning Wednesday to suggest he drop out and instead run for the U.S. Senate seat in Florida. He also suggested the five remaining candidates meet before the Detroit debate to try and work out their differences.
Carson never made a cogent argument for his candidacy, running mostly on his biography rather than policy and political views. Carson undisputedly had an impressive personal story to tell. He overcame a troubled youth in inner-city Detroit, becoming a star student and eventually a world-class neurosurgeon. He won international acclaim in the late 980s after successfully separating conjoined twins. 
In June 2008, President George W. Bush awarded Carson the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. ""For a time, young Ben Carson was headed down that same path,"" Bush said at the time. ""Yet through his reliance on faith and family, he turned his life into a sharply different direction.""  
But Carson's origin story took a hit after a XXX report raised questions about claims he made about violent episodes as a youth. Trump, rising in the polls, took to mocking Carson, particularly over a story from the surgeon's memoir about Carson attempting to stab a friend -- the knife broke in a half after hitting a large belt buckle.  
Carson's debate performances didn't help, either. He often seemed halting in his speech patterns in a forum that prizes quick and snappy soundbites. And his command of policy appeared shaky -- he asserted that the Chinese were in Syria, a claim the White House disputed. He repeatedly deflected questions on how to confront ISIS, among other foreign policy challenges. Even on health care, Carson's seeming specialty, he didn't have many specifics to offer beyond saying that Obamacare should be abolished.
Carson's campaign also suffered internal conflicts, with competing power centers often at odds. In the run-up to the Iowa caucuses, a contest that was crucial to his chances because of his connections with evangelicals, the tensions came to a head, with his top advisers leaving the campaign. Adding to the turmoil, Carson's former advisers were unusually public in their criticism of Carson as a candidate and of his campaign structure. 
R.I.P. religious right, and other Super Tuesday takeaways
When voting actually began, with the February 1 Iowa caucuses, Carson wasn't much of a factor except as a spoiler. He finished fourth at 9.3%. His New Hampshire primary showing was even worse. Carson finished eighth, with only 2.3% of the vote -- ahead only of candidates who had dropped out of the race but whose names remained on the ballot. Then in the February 20 South Carolina primary, Carson finished sixth, with less than 8% of the vote.

Clinton takes aim at Trump over KKK stumble,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-kkk/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 20:49:46,,"Hillary Clinton on Super Tuesday took aim at Donald Trump for not immediately repudiating former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. 
""I'm just speaking out against bigotry and bullying wherever I hear it. And I hear a lot of it from the Republican candidates. They seem to have forgotten completely about issues and they're now running their campaigns based on insults,"" Clinton said, taking questions from reporters. ""It's turned into a kind of one-upmanship on insulting and I don't think that's appropriate in a presidential campaign, and I'm going to speak up on it.""
The Democratic front-runner said that while Trump is doing well, she will ""wait and see who they nominate.""
But she also took aim at Trump for stumbling when asked Sunday by XXX's Jake Tapper to disavow support he has received from Duke, though he has since done so.
""I was very disappointed that he did not disavow what appears to be support from David Duke and the Klan,"" Clinton said. ""That is exactly the kind of statement that should be repudiated upon hearing it.""
Clinton wouldn't comment on what states she believes she will win on Tuesday and batted away a question about whether her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has a path to victory should he lose big.
""We are working hard everywhere,"" Clinton said, responding to questions from her traveling press corps for the first time in 88 days. ""All we can do is help people turn out for the primaries and the caucuses.""
The former secretary of state added that her campaign will wait to ""see what voters decide in all these states that are lined up today"" before they ""take stock"" of what it all means for Sanders' campaign. 
""But I'm going to keep going,"" Clinton said. ""I've got a lot of work to do next Tuesday and the Tuesday after that.""
Clinton's campaign is confident the former secretary of state will do well in states like Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia, all states she has visited in the last few days. They are anticipating Sanders will win Vermont, his home state, and see states like Minnesota, Oklahoma and Massachusetts as toss-ups.
Asked if she will ask Sanders to drop out should he have a bad night, Clinton said, ""Everybody has to make their own decisions.""
After a dominant win in South Carolina on Saturday, Clinton's campaign has been infused with increasing confidence.
Clinton's comments came at Mapps Coffee & Tea, a small coffee shop in Minneapolis. Supporters mingled with Clinton before she took questions from the media. 
Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, an early supporter, worked the shop with her.
After buying a coffee, Clinton was confronted by a young woman who identified herself as Somali-America and questioned Clinton's commitment to racial justice and past comments she has made. Clinton had a long conversation with the woman, explaining her views on race and noting the fact that her first speech as a candidate was on criminal justice reform.
The woman then questioned the authenticity of Somali-Americans who have endorsed Clinton's run for president.
""Why don't you go run for something then?"" Clinton said before the woman quickly left the shop.

Colorado Republicans aren't getting much of a say in 2016,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/colorado-republican-caucuses-confusion/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 3:53:56,,"For Republicans in Colorado, this Super Tuesday might be feeling a little, well, ordinary.
Thanks to a contentious decision by the state GOP last summer, voters there won't be casting ballots for a primary contestant, but rather a delegate -- bound to no candidate -- to attend future meetings. There will be no presidential preference poll, no big winner thanking Centennial State voters for putting a charge into his campaign.
But what possible reason could Colorado Republicans have for choosing to essentially forfeit their plum seat at the 2016 primary table?
The answer traces back to a decision by the national party to tweak their formula entering this year's contests. Going forward, the winner in any state that holds a preference poll would be required to bind its delegates to the winner.
In a statement this weekend, Colorado GOP Chairman Steve House responded to the ""many questions"" he had received about his executive committee's decision.
""There is no such thing as a binding preference poll because when you actually award delegates via a poll it's not a poll -- it's an election,"" House wrote. ""So what's wrong with an election? Nothing if you are actually going to run it with all the precautions and security measures of an actual election.""
House called the prospect of using a ""straw poll"" an ""unacceptable gamble,"" citing the threat of fraud and abuse of ""systemic loopholes.""
Instead, he explained, the state party would employ a ""controlled and secure four-step process.""
This more arduous path to winning Colorado's national delegates will also make it more difficult for supporters of a losing candidate -- like those who backed Ron Paul in 2012 -- to take advantage of nonbinding poll results.
Still, there has been significant blowback inside the state. The Denver Post editorial board on Sunday rejected House's explanations and said the decision ""looks worse with every passing day.""
Instead of having their say in this historically divisive contest, the board wrote, Colorado voters will ""stand on the sidelines on Super Tuesday while other states determine whether Donald Trump continues his march toward a possible nomination or whether his rivals can slow him down.""
But it's not all bad news for those disappointed Colorado voters. With the GOP race potentially stretching into April, when county assemblies and a state convention will be held, the candidates might yet be inclined to schedule some time on the Rocky Mountain campaign trails.

Delegate bonanza or survival fight,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/super-tuesday-highlights/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 17:00:58,,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could make huge strides toward their party's nominations Tuesday as a dozen states vote in primaries and caucuses on the most consequential day yet in the presidential race.
The Super Tuesday contests are a delegate bonanza for front-runners and a test of survival for others as voters head to the polls across the nation, including in the Deep South, in Colorado and Texas, in ice-bound Alaska and Minnesota and in Bernie Sanders' fortress of Vermont.
Trump is expected to notch a large number of victories that could help him stretch his lead in the GOP White House battle and underscore his growing support across all sectors of the Republican coalition. Those wins could come despite being embroiled in a GOP fight that has rival candidates and party elders, desperate to stop his march to the nomination, branding him unfit for the presidency.
His Republican foe Ted Cruz faces a must-win primary in his home state of Texas while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is a long shot to squeeze out his debut victory of the campaign after ditching his previously elevated and aspirational campaign to wage a bitter and personal war of words with Trump.
Super Tuesday: What to watch
Clinton, meanwhile, looks set to build on her huge win in South Carolina on Saturday to sweep through southern primaries where her overwhelming advantage over Sanders among African-American voters is almost certain to be decisive.
Sanders, who is keen to challenge the growing narrative that the former secretary of state is now on track to win the nomination, hopes to halt the Clinton tide in Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma and will likely pocket Vermont.
A total of 595 Republican delegates are up for grabs in 11 states of the 1,237 needed to clinch the GOP nomination in 11 states. Sanders and Clinton are facing off in 11 states for 865 of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the Democratic race.
Super Tuesday is coming at a pivotal moment in the Republican race. It has finally dawned on rival campaigns and alarmed party establishment figures that Trump — after three thumping wins in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — will win the nomination unless there is a dramatic reversal of fortunes.
The former reality television star who has turned American politics upside down with his outsider campaign, nationwide media blitz and crusade against political correctness, is going into Super Tuesday with his polling hitting new peaks.
GOP's Trump revolt: Too little too late?
A national XXX/ORC poll published on Monday shows that Trump has lifted the ceiling on his support that for months hovered around 30% and now has the support of 49% of Republican voters, more than 30 points ahead of Rubio and Cruz. 
Quality polling has been sporadic in some Super Tuesday states, but there are clear signs that Trump leads in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Virginia and Tennessee. Cruz appears to be clinging to a moderate lead in Texas.
Trump's surge has some senior party figures registering alarm that his presence at the top of the Republican ticket, given his controversial rhetoric and stances on issues like immigration, could cost the party not just the White House but control of the Senate as well.
""We can't have a nominee be an albatross around the down-ballot races,"" Republican Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told XXX Monday when asked if he had concerns about the prospect of Trump winning the GOP race. ""That's a concern of mine.""
Exacerbating the fears of the party establishment, Trump struggled Monday to extricate himself from a controversy that erupted after he initially failed to disavow the support of David Duke, a leader of the Ku Klux Klan, during a XXX interview. Trump blamed a malfunctioning earpiece for the oversight but his rivals pounced.
""I don't care how bad the earpiece is, Ku Klux Klan comes through pretty clearly,"" Rubio said during a rally in Tennessee on Monday.
Super Tuesday was once seen by the Cruz campaign as the moment when the Texas senator would build on his support among ideological and evangelical conservative voters and sweep across the South. But Trump upset his best-laid plans.
Now Cruz is left with a nervous wait to see if he will win his home state of Texas, which has the most delegates available Tuesday with 155. Failure to convert a win on home ground would effectively end his campaign.
Cruz rehearsed an argument on Monday that only he, and not Rubio has shown the capacity to win states and to take on Trump.
""I believe after Super Tuesday, we will see this race become more and more a two man race,"" Cruz told reporters on Monday.
National poll: Clinton, Sanders both top Trump
""I think the likely outcome of tomorrow - Donald is going to come out with a whole bunch of delegates. I believe we're going to come out with a whole bunch of delegates. And I think everyone else will be way, way behind.""
Since Tuesday's contests will award delegates proportionally based on a candidate's share of the vote as long as they reach a certain threshold in some states, it will not be possible for Trump to clinch the nomination outright on Tuesday night.
Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are clinging to the hope that they could win their own states on March 15, when contests start to become winner take-all affairs, and eventually overhaul Trump's delegate total.
Rubio is building a case that Trump would be a disaster for Republicans and that only he could unite the party and beat Clinton in a general election.
""I intend to be in this race as long as it takes to prevent someone like Donald Trump who is not a conservative and is a con man from taking over the conservative movement and the party of Reagan,"" Rubio told Fox News on Monday. ""I do not believe Donald Trump can get 1,237 delegates, which is what you need to become the nominee. And I will never give up the fight.""
Clinton's aides know that she cannot knock out Sanders on Tuesday, but they hope to end the night with a lead of around 100 earned delegates.
Sanders is making clear that despite the size of his defeat in South Carolina -- equal to nearly 50% of the vote -- he is nowhere near giving up his campaign, though the candidate himself appears to have rock-bottom expectations in the South.
A Monmouth University poll of the Democratic race published Monday suggested Sanders is in good shape in at least one of those target states, showing that he leads the former secretary of state by 48% to 43% in Oklahoma.
And in Massachusetts, in his last pre-Super Tuesday rally on Monday night, the Vermont senator had an upbeat message.
""Tomorrow there will be 700 delegates up for deciding. We anticipate winning many of them and a majority of them right here in Massachusetts,"" he said.
Clinton, however, appeared to be looking on toward the general election -- and Donald Trump.
""You know America never stopped being great,"" she said in Northern Virginia, referring to Trump's campaign slogan. ""We have to make America whole.""

Donald Trump and the battle for the soul of America,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/trump-and-americas-soul-obeidallah/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 18:18:59,,"There's a good chance that Donald Trump will be the GOP's presidential nominee, if dominance on Super Tuesday is any indication of what's to come, and that means this November's election will not just be a battle for the White House. 
It will be a fight for the soul of America. 
I'm far from alone in this view. We have even seen Republicans such as Sen. Ben Sasse from Nebraska and a number of other conservatives denouncing Trump and pledging that they will not vote for him if he's the GOP nominee. 
They get it: Trump is the antithesis of ""E pluribus unum,"" which appears on the seal of our great nation This Latin expression, which America's Founding Fathers coined, means, ""out of many, one."" 
In contrast to what the Founders intended with these words, Trump's campaign has intentionally tried to divide us by playing on the fears of Americans, many of which attach to race, religion and ethnicity. 
But beyond the nativist views he has espoused (let's call them what they are: bigoted), his tolerance for hate speech and his emboldening of white supremacists, there are also his recent words that appear to support less freedom of expression for Americans. This should also alarm all people who truly love what makes America exceptional. 
The most recent example came Sunday when XXX's Jake Tapper asked Trump if he would denounce the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and other white supremacist groups. Incredibly Trump responded, ""I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists."" 
How can Trump think anyone could actually believe he doesn't know who Duke or the Klan are? After all in 2000, Trump quit the Reform Party when Duke joined, declaring, ""This is not company I wish to keep."" Even more baffling was that three days before the XXX interview, Trump tossed off a quick disavowal of Duke to the media. 
Yet two days before the Super Tuesday primaries in the South, on national TV Trump  tells us he's unaware of his new supporter Duke and the man's role in the Klan. Did Trump not offer a passionate condemnation of Duke and the Klan because, by his own calculation, that could potentially lose him votes in certain primary states? (After the media firestorm erupted, Trump's amnesia cleared, and he tweeted his disavowal of Duke.)
Trump may have settled on distancing himself from Duke, but we now learn that the Trump campaign gave press credentials for an event Saturday to the white supremacist media outlet ""The Political Cesspool Radio Program."" The program bills itself as ""unapologetically pro-White."" To put this in perspective, consider that the Trump campaign refused to extend press credentials to BuzzFeed, The Des Moines (Iowa) Register and Fusion because it viewed their reporters' coverage as too critical. 
The man who wants to be our president shows an ever increasing lack of tolerance for the media and even individuals who dare protest or are critical of him. Just a week ago Trump made a comment that should raise the hair on the back of the neck of any American who believes in a free and vibrant press. Trump told his supporters, ""One of the things I'm going to do if I win ... I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money."" 
Regardless of whether Trump could actually change the libel laws as he suggests, he is making it clear that he would pursue polices as president that would try to rein in criticism of him. This is a sentiment you would expect to hear in a Third World country ruled by a dictator, not the United States of America.
We have even seen a pattern by Trump of apparently trying to silence private citizens who disagree with him. I'm not talking about protesters simply being thrown out of events for interrupting him, which happens with just about all presidential candidates. I'm talking about Trump telling the crowd that the security officers were being too nice to the protester being thrown out, noting, ""I'd like to punch him in the face."" 
Trump also publicly applauded supporters who physically ejected a woman from a rally two weeks ago in South Carolina. What was her ""crime""? She simply stood in silence giving Trump the middle finger. Trump won't even tolerate silent dissent. This is not how we do things in America.
Worse, Trump shockingly defended an assault by his supporters upon a Black Lives Matter protester at a rally in November, telling Fox News the next day, ""Maybe he should have been roughed up."" Again, this is from a man who aspires to be our president.
And on a person level, since I'm Muslim, one of the most chilling moments of the campaign came when Trump encouraged his supporters to cheer for his proposal to engage in warrantless, wholesale surveillance of American Muslims, saying, ""I want surveillance of these people."" 
The idea that Muslims are not fellow Americans but ""these people"" is truly frightening. History has taught us that when a leader dehumanizes a minority group, it can lead to horrific consequences for that group.
The stakes in the 2016 election are simply too high for voters to be bound by political affiliation or ideology.  If you believe America is a nation where white supremacists should be loudly denounced, where ethnic and religious groups should not be demonized for political gain or have fewer rights, and where freedom of expression is valued, then you must take a stand in 2016.
 Our nation's soul depends on it."
Donald Trump's latest nomination contest is with GOP,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/donald-trump-republican-establishment-fight/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 23:38:32,,"Super Tuesday winners expect better.
But there's never been a presidential candidate like Donald Trump, and while the billionaire's willingness to buck convention has been a strength in the tumultuous 2016 race, it came with a downside Wednesday.
Any other candidate would be embraced by his party as a conquering hero after Tuesday night's wins. Instead, he's getting the cold shoulder reserved for an especially obstinate unwanted guest from GOP leaders who see him as a toxic influence that could cost them the White House and Senate -- and leave a stain on the party of Lincoln, if not tear it apart.
Trump might have cemented his role as front-runner in the GOP race, but he now faces a tricky period as he tries to put the nomination truly beyond reach of his rivals, and not only the ones on the ballot. He faces accelerating efforts by conservatives and establishment figures alike to thwart his White House dreams at the 11th hour. 
""We all agree Trump as the nominee would be a disaster morally, politically, and electorally. Well, then, let's do something about it,"" prominent talk radio host Steve Deace, who has endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, wrote in a Facebook post late Tuesday.

Some lawmakers are also beginning to break with precedent and repudiate the party's front-runner. Nebraska's Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said over the weekend he won't vote for Trump even if he becomes the nominee.
And Virginia GOP Rep. Scott Rigell warned on ""The Lead"" with Jake Tapper Wednesday that he would not vote for Trump either, arguing that he lacked judgment on foreign policy and was not fit to be commander in chief.
""This extremis moment that we are in, in our country -- the solution is not Donald Trump,"" Rigell said. ""I truly believe he would harm our country.""
Yet many Republican voters feel differently. Trump enjoyed a seven-state romp on Super Tuesday to take his primary and caucus win total to 10. Traditionally at this point he'd be wallowing in the plaudits of his party and tasting the power endowed by his first few hours as its presumptive presidential nominee.
After winning a swath of states with diverse ideological, geographical and demographic profiles, like Trump has, such a candidate would expect his main foes to fold their campaigns to fall in behind him -- especially in an election likely to feature Democrat Hillary Clinton, a rallying point for GOP hatred for decades.
RELATED: GOP reaches a crossroads
Instead, Trump must brace for a torrent of revelations from his own side about his business practices, his personality, what he really believes behind closed doors and questions on whether he's qualified to preside over a nuclear arsenal from opponents who balk at his takeover of their party.
It could be an onslaught with far more punch than the nascent #NeverTrump meme on Twitter -- started by Republicans.
As an anti-Trump movement gathered force Wednesday, former Republican nominee Mitt Romney scheduled a high-profile speech on the race on Thursday in which he's expected to criticize Trump. GOP candidate Ben Carson pulled out of Thursday's Republican debate and told supporters in a press release Wednesday that he saw no path forward, in a move that could help Trump rivals Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
And doubts over Trump are not confined to his politics in a year in which conservatives had high hopes of nominating the most ideologically pure nominee since Ronald Reagan.  
There is also deep skepticism among some conservatives about his behavior and explosive rhetoric as well. Many Republicans feel Trump's emotive language toward groups including Mexicans, women and Muslims is disqualifying.
""This is a guy who has made, shall we say, racially insensitive remarks, things that conservatives who care about defending the cause of conservatism cannot in good conscience abide,"" said Matt Lewis, a XXX commentator and author of a new book that argues the Republican party has betrayed its conservative roots.
Former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay told XXX's Brooke Baldwin that he hoped Romney would lead an effort to explain that the race is not over.
""Trump ought to take a pause. He lost four states last night, which shows he is vulnerable. He only has right now 300 delegates. He needs 1,237,"" DeLay said.
DeLay is technically correct that Trump has yet to put the nomination out of reach of Rubio and Cruz. The theory of his opponents is that once more states hand out delegates on a winner-take-all basis after March 15, his lead of around 100 delegates over Cruz and 200 over Rubio could be overhauled should either of them start claiming more first-place finishes. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is also hoping to stack up delegates when the race hits the Midwest.
At the very least, Trump opponents hope to prevent the real estate mogul from harvesting sufficient delegates to clinch the nomination before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in July.

But Trump has advantages that could blunt any organized GOP bids to thwart him -- just as he has succeeded in bending the contours of the presidential race to his will throughout his campaign.
In his press conference on Tuesday night, he several times delivered a veiled warning to Republican Party leaders that they would be taking on more than just his campaign if they resorted to attacks on his character.
""But remember this. I have millions and millions and millions of people,"" he said in a possible reference to his earlier warnings that he could bolt the party and mount an independent bid for president if he was not treated fairly.
No other candidate has greater momentum or a greater claim to the nomination at this point. His closest rival, Cruz, has only won three states and Rubio just one. A bid to wrest the party banner away from his hands would risk alienating his fervent supporters, who might then repudiate any subsequent nominee that emerges.
RELATED: The backlash against Chris Christie
Furthermore, Trump's strength in recent Southern nominating contests suggests he will run strongly in primaries and caucuses in places like Louisiana and Kentucky Saturday and next week in Mississippi. The Rubio camp's theory that a victory in his home state of Florida on March 15 will buckle the billionaire's hopes of the nomination is undercut by a recent Sunshine State poll showing Trump with a clear lead.
In another odd twist, Trump's loss in Texas, the biggest state of Super Tuesday with 155 delegates, may have actually helped him, since Cruz's win gave him a rationale to stay in the race. That ensures opposition to the billionaire will remain fractured for a few more weeks at least.
And while it is possible to pick holes in Trump's path to the nomination, his route is far more credible than those of his rivals.
Many pundits have long suggested that Trump has a ceiling of around 30% in the polls and would slump once the field narrowed.
But he hit 49% in Massachusetts, 39% in Tennessee and 43% in Alabama on Tuesday. In a new XXX national poll this week, Trump reached 49% support among all Republican voters.
In a bid to underpin his wins on Super Tuesday, Trump argued at a victory lap press conference that he was a ""unifier"" and took immediate aim at Clinton, possibly to help GOP voters envisage a presidential race that could bring the party together, its numbers swelled by new Trump voters.
""We are expanding the party,"" he said. ""Once we get all of this finished, I am going to go after one person -- that is Hillary Clinton.""
And in a possible sign of a tack Tuesday towards female voters important in a general election -- who may feel alienated by his rhetoric -- Trump noted that millions of women had been helped by Planned Parenthood, an organization reviled by conservatives.
Still, not all of Trump's positioning appears to be working. If securing the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was meant to confer establishment approval on his campaign, it backfired. The former GOP presidential candidate has been widely lampooned over a move that seemed to fly in the face of his previous criticisms of Trump's fitness to serve as president. And Christie became the subject of Twitter mockery over his apparent discomfort on stage during Trump's news conference on Tuesday night.

And there were some warning signs in the results on Tuesday. Following predictions that he could sweep up to 10 Super Tuesday states, Trump had to content himself with seven. He faced a tougher fight in a crucial swing state -- Virginia -- than polls had predicted, in a sign that not all Republican voters are reconciled to having the former reality star as their presidential nominee.
Exit polls showed that voters who made up their minds there in the last few days chose Rubio, a possible indication that the Florida senator's furious attacks on his rival's character and business record may have had an impact over the last week.
""Five days ago, we began to explain to the American people that Donald Trump is a con artist,"" Rubio told supporters in Florida on Tuesday night.
""In just five days, we have seen the impact it is having all across the country,"" he continued. ""We are seeing in state after state -- he loves to talk about polls -- we are seeing in state after state his numbers coming down, our numbers going up.""
That kind of evidence may embolden Republican opponents of Trump -- and a super PAC effort currently lining up against him staffed by establishment Republican operatives -- to test what damage a full-bore negative advertising assault on Trump's character and business record could wreak on the billionaire's polling.
But there is little precedent in this campaign for any effort by establishment figures to succeed in denting his hopes. It's even possible that efforts by the likes of Romney might do more to endear Trump with his loyal outsider base of voters than to harm him among traditional Republicans.

Donald Trump's Super Tuesday press conference,http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2016/03/02/donald-trump-super-tuesday-entire-speech-sot.cnn,cnn,3/2/2016 4:43:18,,
Donald Trump stands by softer tone on Planned Parenthood,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/donald-trump-planned-parenthood-good-work/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 6:02:05,,"Donald Trump on Tuesday night once again sought to strike a softer tone on Planned Parenthood, paying tribute to its ""very good work for millions of women"" while also keeping up a threat to cut off federal funding to the organization if it continues to offer abortion services. 
With Super Tuesday victories in his back pocket, Trump at a press conference in South Florida pledged to expand the base of the Republican Party, calling himself a ""common sense conservative"" while assuring voters he considered women's health issues ""very important.""
""Planned Parenthood has done very good work for millions of women,"" he said. ""But we're not going to allow and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood. We understand that, and I've said it loud and clear.""
""We'll see what happens,"" he continued, ""but I've had thousands of letters from women that have been helped. This wasn't a set-up, this was people writing letters.""
Of his tack on Planned Parenthood, Trump conceded it was ""not a perfect conservative view,"" but offered a counterweight by promising to be ""more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall."" 
Trump's comments Tuesday night echoed those he made less than a week earlier at the XXX Republican debate in Houston.
""As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life, I'm totally against abortion having to do with Planned Parenthood,"" the GOP front-runner said on Thursday. ""But millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by Planned Parenthood. So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly.""
Trump's Republican primary rivals have repeatedly questioned his anti-abortion credentials, often referencing a 1999 appearance on ""Meet the Press"" in which he described himself as ""pro-choice in every respect."" 
More recently, during an interview with XXX's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" in August, Trump raised eyebrows by saying he was ""sure"" Planned Parenthood did ""some things properly and good and good for women, and I would look at that.""
Among the most vocal doubters has been Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who at his own Super Tuesday rally said Trump ""supports Planned Parenthood."" By contrast, Cruz said, ""I will direct the Justice Department to investigate"" the organization.
Planned Parenthood itself also sought to undermine Trump's message, dismissing any suggestion of a moderate turn and saying in a statement he had ""built his presidential campaign on racism, misogyny and xenophobia.""
""Trump would ban abortion, and eliminate women's ability to have birth control covered by health insurance,"" Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in an email. ""A Trump presidency would be a disaster for women.""

Exit polls: Super Tuesday's top takeaways,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/exit-polls-super-tuesday-takeaways/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 20:59:35,,"Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton emerged stronger from Super Tuesday than when they entered, picking up solid wins in Southern states and boosting their delegate leads over their respective opponents. But exit polling data from across the dozen states where voters to took to the polls offered interesting insights into the electorate.

Despite all the tough talk from the Republican candidates about deporting illegal immigrants, GOP voters in most Super Tuesday states said they support offering legal status to undocumented workers. 
In Texas, which has among the highest share of undocumented immigrants in the labor force, some 47% of Republican voters want to offer them legal status, while 43% would rather deport them, according to exit polls. 
In Georgia, which has a growing Latino community, the split is 53%-39%.
Only in Alabama did voters prefer to deport these immigrants, by a 50% to 45% split.
The billionaire businessman handily won seven state races on Tuesday, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz besting him in three states and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio securing one win.
Immigration has been a key talking point in the Republican campaign, with candidates sparring with each other over their positions. Trump has said repeatedly that he would build a wall with Mexico to keep undocumented workers from crossing the border. 

The thrice married Trump, who at times brought his personal copy of the Bible on the campaign trail, was the favorite of voters in Southern states for whom ""shared values"" mattered.
In Alabama, Trump won 43% of the total vote compared to runner-up Ted Cruz's 21%. It was a state where 78% of voters said they cared about shared values with the candidate they supported: Trump won 39% of them, compared to 26% for Cruz, the son of an evangelical preacher.
Trump also won those voters in Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, and coming within a point of Cruz in Arkansas.
And Trump was also tops for those who identified as born-again or evangelical voters, also driving his victories. In Alabama, Trump won 44% of voters who identified as such, compared to 22% for runner-up Cruz.

Cruz's hopes to win the Republican presidential nomination were pinned in large part on winning his home state of Texas, a delegate rich state up for grabs on Tuesday. And he did: 44% to Trump's 27%. 
And while he was no doubt buoyed by his familiarity with the state -- and voters' familiarity with him -- Cruz also was able to pull off an interesting feat: winning support of voters on both sides of the immigration debate.
That is, Cruz was the top choice of Texas voters who think undocumented immigrants in the U.S. should be offered legal status and those who think they should be deported to their home county. The Texas senator, who rivals have at times accused of flip-flopping on the controversial issue (which he denies), seems to have found a way to thread the needle in the Lone Star State.
Among voters who said undocumented workers should be offered legal status, Cruz won 38% compared to Sen. Marco Rubio's 29%. Among those who think they should be deported, 47% picked Cruz compared to 34% for Trump.

Speaking of Texas, Clinton's win there was buoyed by her victories among minority voters. She won 83% of African-American voters, compared to Sanders' 15% and she won 71% of the Latino voters, compared to 29% for Sanders, according to exit polling.
And it wasn't just there: In Alabama, Clinton won 89% of the non-white vote, in Arkansas she won 83%, in Georgia she won 81%, in Tennessee she won 85% and in Virginia she won 76%.
But in Oklahoma, where Sanders defeated her 52% to 42%, Clinton won minority voters by a narrower margin, 56% compared to Sanders' 40%.

On the Democratic side, Clinton won seven contests compared to rival Bernie Sanders' four. But where the Vermont senator did win, it was clear his appeal to independents helped tip the scales. 
No exit poll data was available for Sanders' victories in the Colorado and Minnesota caucuses, but in Oklahoma and Vermont, the senator posted solid wins among independents. In Oklahoma, 27% of voters said they were independents; of those, nearly 7-in-10 voted for Sanders.
And in Sanders' home state of Vermont the contrast was even more stark: Of the 4-in-10 voters who identified as independents, 92% voters for him.

Sanders' campaign centers on income inequality. But that message didn't win him followers in many Super Tuesday states. 
Clinton won the clear majority of voters in six states who said that the U.S. economy generally favors the wealthy. She secured more than 60% of these voters in each of these states.
Sanders, on the other hand, squeaked by in two states, winning 51% in Massachusetts and 54% in Oklahoma. Only in his home state of Vermont did 88% of voters who think the system is rigged vote for him.
Overall, Clinton won seven Super Tuesday states, while Sanders secured victory in four.

Rubio earned the support of those with college and postgraduate degrees in Oklahoma and Virginia, and those with postgraduate degrees in Arkansas and Georgia. 
Those with less than a college degree turned out for Trump in nearly every state. The front-runner said ""I love the poorly educated"" in his Nevada victory speech last month.
Only in Texas did Cruz win the top spot among voters across the educational spectrum.

"First on XXX: Ted Cruz could have dropped out if he lost Texas, chief strategist says",http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/ted-cruz-texas-super-tuesday/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 23:28:25,,"Ted Cruz would have seriously considered dropping out of the Republican presidential race had he lost his home state of Texas on Super Tuesday, his campaign's chief strategist told donors Wednesday. 
In a detailed 30-minute call with several dozen donors, Jason Johnson said that Cruz himself was comfortable stepping aside if he had lost Texas. Cruz won the state handily, although some polls showed a tighter race headed into Election Day. Cruz went into the year anticipating a strong showing in the Southern states on Super Tuesday, but only came away with wins in Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska, and trails Trump by more than 100 delegates.
""Last night, when we were going through the different scenarios on what might occur, the senator asked what if we lose Texas,"" Johnson said. ""And I said that's simple: You don't have to do it on the stage, but you clearly stand there and remind people that 'tonight is not a reflection of the ideas, the issues, the vision, etc. But clearly we now have to pull back and pray and think about who we throw our support behind in order to reignite the promise of America -- because clearly it ain't me.'"" 
Johnson said his boss was receptive to that. 
""Well there was zero pushback from Ted Cruz,"" Johnson told the fundraisers. ""You might say it's a duh. But it's not a duh."" 
""You get into this campaign. And it's so hard to let go,"" he said, but telling the donors they are clear-eyed about the path ahead. ""This is not a campaign that will resist letting go if the path is not there."" 
CNN listened to the call after obtaining information about it from a participant. The Cruz campaign did not comment regarding Johnson's discussions with the senator over dropping out.
The discussion of Cruz leaving the race comes as Republicans continue to fight over who is best poised to take on Trump. Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have both outlined paths to victory to their supporters, as has Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
""Tomorrow morning, we have a choice. If the field remains divided, Donald Trump will be the nominee,"" Cruz told supporters in Texas on Tuesday evening. ""For the candidates who have not yet won a state, who have not racked up significant delegates, I ask you to prayerfully consider coming together, uniting."" 

Cruz plans to offer an ""olive branch"" in Thursday night's Republican debate to voters currently not supporting him, Johnson told donors, part of what he pitched as an aggressive, intentional effort to make Cruz more attractive to voters who are unfriendly to the Texas firebrand's style. 
""If I'm a voter siting out there,"" Johnson said, ""and Ted Cruz isn't my first choice but Donald Trump is my last choice -- and I believe Ted Cruz is the best way to beat Donald Trump -- it needs to be easy for that person to come to the Ted Cruz campaign."" 
Johnson told donors the campaign believes Cruz has a significantly more viable path to the GOP nomination than did Marco Rubio, who Johnson portrayed as a major stumbling block to beating Trump in a one-on-one race. But he also expressed severe skepticism that the anti-Trump forces would consolidate quickly, saying that Rubio is very unlikely to be convinced that his path is improbable, potentially leading Trump to the GOP nomination. 
Cruz has fought criticism over his strategy from some of his own allies about his reluctance to take on Trump earlier in the campaign,  when he mostly trained his fire on Rubio.
""I needed to build my base of support. I needed to take care so that I was on a strong foundation first before I could take him on,"" he told XXX's Dana Bash on Tuesday evening, pushing back on the idea that Cruz missed his chance to define Trump. ""Not remotely. This is an ongoing conversation.""
The campaign is eager for Rubio to lose Florida on March 15. But it is also bullish on Cruz's chances in Kansas, Louisiana, Idaho, Michigan, and surprisingly, in Johnson's eyes, Maine. Two states where Johnson was skeptical of Cruz's chances: Mississippi, which he called a ""big question mark"" and labeled it more ""populist than conservative,"" and Hawaii. 
Johnson cast significant doubt on the path forward for Rubio, who is increasingly staking his campaign's viability on a win in Florida later this month, characterizing Rubio's path as ""Doug Flutie with the hangover with the Hail Mary pass on Saturday morning of going to the 15th."" And he called Rubio's recent penchant for insults with Trump a significant black mark on Rubio's presidential aspirations -- as much as the Cruz team enjoyed them. 
""As entertaining as it was during the last debate -- and frankly as therapeutic it was for people, myself included -- to watch Marco engage in his old locker room glory days of trading insults and following up the next week talking about the size of Donald Trump's hands -- it's not going to get the job done,"" Johnson said. ""What's going to get the job done is contrasting in a presidential way with Donald Trump.""

GOP faces brutal choice on Trump,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/super-tuesday-trump-gop-louis/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 20:39:17,,"Only days after feuding with Pope Francis, childishly mocking a rival and offering a patently ridiculous explanation for why he failed to denounce the support of a Ku Klux Klan leader immediately, Donald Trump unveiled a more serious and conciliatory side following his impressive multistate victories on Super Tuesday. Trump 2.0, the conservative Hot Air website called it. 
""We're going to be a much bigger party. We're going to be an expanded party,"" said the normally combative Trump, who even offered a bit of an olive branch to the press, claiming, ""I'm becoming diplomatic.""
He'll need a lot more talk like that to calm the fears of nervous GOP leaders. Several senior Republicans say they will not support Trump under any circumstances, and the party's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, is expected to deliver pointed remarks about the state of the race this week. 
One reason for the rising panic among much of the so-called Republican establishment over Trump's sweeping Super Tuesday victories is that the same erratic style and divisive policies that work so well for him -- calling for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, a halt on all immigration by Muslims and building a massive wall on the Mexico border -- probably won't work for many of his fellow Republicans running for re-election to Congress this year.  
Republicans are defending 24 Senate seats this fall, and losing five of them will mean losing control of the chamber back to the Democrats. 
In swing states, including New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, Republican senators and congressmen will need the active support of independents and Democrats -- precisely the kind of voters most turned off by Trump's harsh rhetoric, petty insults, factual errors and hard-line promises.  
""We can't have a nominee be an albatross around the down-ballot races,"" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas recently told XXX. ""That's a concern of mine.""
Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, agrees: ""It's a concern to have Trump at the top of the ticket, no doubt, for anybody on the ballot."" 
Flake and Cornyn have cause to be concerned. Consider the plight of Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who won by a razor-thin 2% margin in 2010. Toomey can't win without making inroads among Democrats and independents in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but that task will be monumentally harder with the volatile Trump at the top of the ticket. 
It gets worse for Toomey, a fiscal conservative who once was president of the anti-tax Club for Growth. Last fall the group ran an ad campaign attacking Trump before the Iowa caucuses and would have a hard time making peace with the candidate if he becomes the nominee. And just when he most needs the help of a unified local party to help him, Toomey -- who is backing his fellow senator, Marco Rubio, for president -- has already seen one congressman from Pennsylvania decide to back Trump, and others may do the same. 
In New Hampshire, Sen. Kelly Ayotte is fighting off a stiff challenge by the state's Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan -- and, like Toomey, is relying on crossover Democrats and independent voters to help her win re-election. That task gets complicated if Trump is the leading Republican at the top of the ticket: She recently called Trump's initial refusal to disavow an ex-Ku Klux Klan leader ""disgusting and offensive.""
Sen. Ron Johnson, facing a tough re-election fight in Wisconsin and trailing in the polls behind ex-Sen. Russ Feingold, is expressing worry about Trump's impact on his race.  And two of the highest-ranking Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature ""say they won't support Trump and would consider voting for a conservative third-party candidate in the general election if he's the nominee,"" according to the Wisconsin State Journal. 
In Ohio, Sen. Rob Portman is explicitly seeking distance: ""I'm not a rabble-rousing, red-meat Donald Trump guy,"" he told The Washington Post. And Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois bluntly broke with Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric: ""In a typical Chicago way, to my Mexican-American friends, I would say, 'Donald Trump callate' -- shut up.""
An internal memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee outlined the danger last fall in a section called ""Donald Trump is a Misguided Missile"": ""Let's face facts. Donald Trump says what's on his mind and that's a problem,"" the memo says. ""Our candidates will have to spend full time defending him or condemning him if that continues."" 
Nothing about Trump's Super Tuesday wins changes that hard reality. No matter how much the new ""diplomatic"" Trump tries to mend fences, Democrats have a large body of videos and documented statements showing him using or accepting profanity, inaccuracies, violence at rallies, bigoted statements and other rowdy behavior. 
That leaves party leaders with a difficult choice: Back Trump's bid and risk losing control of the Senate, or hang onto control of Congress for dear life -- and let Trump stand or fall without help from the establishment for which he has expressed such contempt."
GOP lawmakers brace for Trump nomination,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-congress-gop/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 2:03:10,,"Donald Trump appears on track to secure the Republican presidential nomination, but some top congressional Republicans have never met him, and their private anxiety about running on the same ticket as the unpredictable billionaire businessman is starting to go public. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan had one brief conversation with Trump at a political event when he was Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012, but hasn't spoken to him since. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made headlines recently saying he could work with Trump, but an aide tells XXX the two have never sat down together.   
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has acknowledged he received political donations from Trump, but the last time they spoke was by phone last year. Like Ryan, McConnell regularly refuses to comment on the GOP presidential contest, other than saying that he thought the Republican nominee in 2016 should be someone who can win in ""purple states.""
With Trump poised to rack up more wins in several states voting on Super Tuesday the reality of a reality star leading the Grand Old Party this fall is starting to sink in on Capitol Hill.
The No. 2 Senate GOP leader, Sen. John Cornyn issued the strongest warning to date on Monday about Trump telling XXX , ""We can't have a nominee be an albatross around the down-ballot races, that's a concern of mine.""
Cornyn said he has met Trump but never thought he would run for president. 
""I think he certainly is a controversial figure -- I think we need someone who can unify the party, as opposed to divide the party,"" he said.
Sen. Ron Johnson, who is up for re-election in the blue state of Wisconsin, told reporters Monday, ""I literally pray every night that our nominee is someone with integrity, intelligence, courage and ideas -- so I'm going to keep praying.""
Asked if that could be Trump, Johnson wouldn't be pinned down. 
""We'll see how this process plays out,"" he said.
Rep. Chris Collins of New York is one of the few Republicans on the Hill who does have a relationship with Trump, telling XXX the two met in 2014 to discuss the businessman's interest in a possible gubernatorial race.  Collins initially backed Jeb Bush for president, but became the first member of Congress to endorse Trump last week. 
The New York Republican predicted GOP anxiety about Trump will fade, ""because Hillary Clinton is the big uniter. The Supreme Court -- bigger issues are at play. First, Second Tenth Amendment and Supreme Court are at play. She is the great uniter.""
But another New York Republican, Rep. Peter King, said on XXX Monday that Trump becoming the standard bearer for Republicans, would at best ""be a short-term victory"" but on balance ""it's a terrible loss.""
King said initially he thought Trump had the potential to bring new voters into the Republican Party. But after a string of controversial comments, King endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio last week, and said if Trump won the nomination, ""he's going to put a scar on the party that we're not going to recover from for a long time.""
But the Senate's most senior Republican, Orrin Hatch of Utah, struck a more conciliatory tone. He said if Trump does beat his preferred candidate, Rubio, he could campaign for the real estate mogul.
""If he's our nominee, I'll do everything I can to elect him,"" Hatch told XXX .
Multiple Republicans XXX interviewed did agree that having Trump face Clinton in November was better than having Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz as the party's nominee, because Trump's appeal wasn't limited to just conservative primary voters. But few have a firm grasp on what it would be like to work with a President Trump if he took office in 2017.
""We disagree on taxes. We disagree on privacy. We disagree on private property. He doesn't seem to understand Obamacare,"" one senior House GOP leadership aide told XXX , adding, ""Donald Trump in the Republican primary is supposed to be different than Donald Trump in the general, so I don't know.""
While Cornyn is sounding alarm bells about the damage Trump could do, other Republicans say whether or not Trump is a positive or a negative factor is a function of where you live.
South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney pointed to polls showing Trump running competitive nationally, saying he can help GOP candidates in places like the Northeast where the party has struggled in the past.
""How does having a Republican presidential candidate not help you if you are running in upstate New York, or even in Connecticut or Massachusetts or Pennsylvania?"" Mulvaney, who hasn't endorsed anyone since his preferred candidate, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, dropped out of the race. He told reporters he still hasn't seen any evidence that Trump works against Republican candidates. 
Rep. Scott Garrett, who represents a competitive northern New Jersey district, told XXX his constituents know Trump better than most others across the country. He hasn't endorsed anyone in the race either, and asked what it would be like to work with a President Trump, Garrett begged off, telling XXX , ""different from this administration, how's that?""
Even Collins acknowledged ""there's a lot of division"" and there are ""some worry warts"" trying to figure out how the businessman's high profile and sometimes controversial comments mean for them in November.
Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole, a former chair of the House GOP's campaign committee, has never met Trump. He told XXX that Trump and other GOP presidential candidates' stinging criticism of the Republican controlled Congress amounted to a ""cheap shot"" that hurts the party as it works to prove it can get things done.
""They're all playing into the anger. We had a pretty successful year last year and Republican presidential candidates telling Republican voters that the Republican Congress is the problem I think is exceptionally short sighted,"" Cole told XXX .
Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who is running for re-election this year told XXX , ""all of us are concerned, of course -- about the divisions in the party.""
While Cole wasn't ready to say Trump had the nomination locked up, he disagreed with the assessment of others in his party who believe he'll pose a problem for congressional candidates. 
""We're seeing really intense Republican energy and turnout and I think that will happen in November,"" he said.
Ryan stresses in national interviews that his most important job in 2016 is fashioning a detailed policy agenda for the eventual GOP nominee. But while top House GOP leaders and committee chairman are crafting legislation on a range of issues like replacing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, overhauling federal anti-poverty programs, it's unclear any of their proposals will be embraced by Trump.
Ryan continues to say he'll support whoever the nominee is, but he declined several attempts at his weekly press conference to explain why he thought Trump would endorse a platform developed by the same Republicans in Congress he has been running against for months.
Trump's success so far is based on avoiding specifics, and Collins argued he should avoid getting in the weeds on policy issues. 
""I think his leadership as a chief executive, his staying on the almost Reaganesque topline message: 'make America great again,' he's going to secure the borders, he's going to bring jobs back from China, stand firm with Russia, Iran, North Korea and ISIS. Those topline messages absolutely resonate throughout the country,""  Collins told XXX .
Cole told XXX that despite the rough primary rhetoric, he believes by time the political convention rolls around this summer that it's possible for the party to unite.
""You'll be amazed how quickly the wounds heal up, how fast everybody becomes 'good friends,'"" he said."
GOP reaches a crossroads,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/donald-trump-super-tuesday-republican-party/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 6:29:53,,"Donald Trump dominated Super Tuesday, notching seven victories -- more than three times as many as his closest competitor -- in states from Georgia to Massachusetts on a day that marked a turning point in his quest for the White House.
On the morning after, one thing is clear: the Republican party is at a crossroads
Many party leaders and establishment Republicans see two paths ahead. One is to accept what appears to be the increasingly likely outcome in the 2016 race — that Trump will soon clinch the GOP nomination — and offer the New York businessman their blessing. The second is a path of a historic rebellion: rejecting the GOP front-runner and the values and principles he stands for, and pledging to oppose Trump — even if he emerges as the party's nominee.
Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who ran for president in 2012, described this moment as an ""inflection point"" in the 2016 race and for the Republican Party.
""The party is fractured, which isn't unusual for political parties and they almost always come back together. But this could test the outer limits of that tradition,"" Pawlenty, who endorsed Marco Rubio, told XXX . ""If the Republican Party were an airplane and you're looking out the window, you'd see some pieces of the surface flying off. And you'd be wondering whether the engine or a wing is next.""
6 takeaways from Super Tuesday
With Trump adding delegates to his quickly growing stash Tuesday, political veterans suspect the GOP presidential race could reach a moment of unambiguous clarity in the next two weeks. That point could come on March 15 when Florida and Ohio vote. If Rubio, the Florida senator, and John Kasich, the Ohio governor, lose their home states, their campaigns would be doomed.
Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott put it this way: By March 15, Republicans will know whether it is time to ""throw up our hands in despair and panic.""
""We've now backed ourselves into a corner here -- and it's not very pretty,"" said Lott, who is supporting Kasich. Super Tuesday, Lott added, ""is not the final blow, but we will know in the next two weeks whether this is a done deal or not.""

In recent days, there has been a flurry of discussions among top Republican strategists and insiders about how to distance the party from Trump. His heated rhetoric about minority groups and immigrants is deeply troubling to party leaders who have spent years trying to make inroads with Latino and other minority constituencies. Also of grave concern are the down-ballot candidates who would face tough elections in November with Trump at the top of the ticket. 
Disaffected Republicans are discussing everything from skipping the Republican National Convention in July to running a conservative candidate as an independent or third-party candidate -- with the ultimate goal of denying Trump the presidency. One of the names frequently mentioned in this hypothetical is Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, even though he has shown no desire to run another campaign but has shown a zest for attacking Trump.
Trump's dominance on Super Tuesday caps the GOP front-runner's remarkable rise as a first-time presidential candidate. His initial surge in the polls months ago was widely dismissed as a short-lived phenomenon. His divisive and inflammatory rhetoric on everything from immigration to women drew fierce scorn from fellow Republicans and Democrats alike. 
But Trump's candidacy has proven shockingly durable, and his supporters exceptionally loyal. 
His dominant night comes just days after another development shocked the party to its core: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's bombshell endorsement of the billionaire last week. Christie ended his own presidential bid last month, and the unexpected decision from the former chairman of the Republican Governor's Association to back Trump — the ultimate anti-establishment candidate —  added a critical sense of credibility to the businessman's candidacy. 
Christie's endorsement was quickly followed by the backing of Maine Gov. Paul LePage and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. 
Former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who has no plans to endorse a candidate in the GOP primary, said he was ""shocked"" by Christie's decision, and that the slew of new endorsements have irreversibly changed perceptions of Trump's candidacy.

""Trump is putting together a very unique coalition that's rattled a lot of people who have made a living out of trying to win within a Republican structure which is now increasingly obsolete,"" Gingrich said.  ""A lot of people smugly said when we get down to reality, he is not going to be the nominee because in the end people aren't going to vote for him. Well, guess what — he's almost certainly going to be the nominee.""
As Trump has started to pick up endorsements from serious conservative leaders including a handful of members of Congress, a fierce anti-Trump movement has started to pick up steam. 
Republican operatives, party leaders and conservative thinkers are increasingly warning that Trump is not a true conservative, and that his penchant for offensive language proves that he's an entertainer who should have no role shaping the future of the Republican Party. These rumblings turned into a movement on social media marked with the hashtag ""#NeverTrump"" -- a vow to never back Trump, even if he becomes the nominee. 
But these last-minute strategy sessions underscore the fundamental lack of a coordinated effort in the party to derail Trump's campaign. Many are simply resigned to accepting that this far along in the election, and considering the delegate math, no amount of money or anti-Trump messaging can slow the front-runner's momentum. 
Over the weekend, Trump only fueled the anger directed at his campaign when he failed to denounce white supremacist groups. 
Van Jones rips Donald Trump and the KKK
""I don't know anything about David Duke, OK?"" Trump told XXX 's Jake Tapper when asked whether he would disavow the Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, who is supporting Trump's campaign. Pressed several times, Trump insisted he didn't know anything about white supremacists. 

The interview unleashed fierce backlash. 
On Sunday evening, GOP Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse became the first member of Congress to join the #NeverTrump movement. If Trump wins the GOP nomination, Sasse said he would look for a third-party alternative. 
""I'm not going to vote for Hillary Clinton, and given what we know about Donald Trump, I can't vote for that guy either,"" the first-term senator said. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took Trump to task on Monday, saying Republicans must unequivocally reject racism. 
But the anti-Trump campaign is also angering some party elders. They say rejecting the GOP nominee is tantamount to handing the election to the eventual Democratic nominee, widely expected to be Hillary Clinton, who had a strong night on Super Tuesday. 
Former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson, who supported Jeb Bush's failed White House bid, told XXX that these rebelling Republicans may as well be casting their votes for Clinton. He also expressed deep frustration at the party for failing to rally around a single alternative to Trump, like Bush or Kasich, early enough in the election. 
""Just go ahead and support Hillary and forget it!"" said Simpson. ""They may not like Trump -- they didn't like Bush. What the hell was wrong with Bush? What the hell is wrong with Kasich?""
Gingrich, who pledged to back the party's eventual nominee, predicted that many of his fellow Republicans who now say they could never support Trump will eventually change their minds.  
""The absence of voting for the Republican nominee is functionally a vote for Hillary,"" Gingrich said. ""It's a crossroads for the Republican Party and it's a crossroads for America.""

GOP's Trump revolt: Too little too late?,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-gop-revolt/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 3:21:23,,"The aura of inevitability settling around Donald Trump's bid for the Republican presidential nomination is finally provoking what many of his GOP rivals have dreamed of for months: a sustained attack by party elders on the billionaire mogul.
Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who recently reemerged to predict ""a bombshell"" in Trump's tax returns, accused Trump Monday of ""coddling ... repugnant bigotry"" and called his failure to immediately condemn the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke ""repugnant & disgusting."" (Trump blamed a faulty earpiece; claiming he misunderstood the question from XXX 's Jake Tapper).
Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse vowed never to support Trump because of his ""relentless focus"" on ""dividing Americans."" John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, predicted that Trump would be ""an albatross around the down-ballot races."" Ken Mehlman, who ran George W. Bush's winning campaign in 2004, penned a Facebook post castigating Trump by stating that leaders shouldn't need to research whether to reject Klan support. ""They also don't mock people with disabilities, insult war heroes, divide people by religion and nationality, and insult women. #NeverTrump,"" Mehlman wrote.  
Everything changes March 1
The GOP revolt comes as Trump is poised to cruise toward victory in the Super Tuesday contests -- a crucial day in the nomination process when 595 delegates are up for grabs. But the question is whether the Republican outcry against Trump will have any real impact on voters as they head to the polls in more than a dozen states and territories, particularly as he racks up endorsements from key figures like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.

Allies close to Rubio and Cruz insist there is still time to defeat Trump -- a scenario that would involve winning their home states and pulling off strong results in other delegate-rich states in March. But in interviews, many GOP operatives acknowledged that scenario was highly unlikely, barring some huge upset on Tuesday night.
""When you look at operatives, donors, and the opinion elite, they are all scared to death that Trump is going to be the nominee,"" said Russ Schriefer, a senior adviser to Romney's 2012 campaign, as well as Christie's recent presidential bid. ""But then you look at voters and they are quite comfortable with Trump as the nominee... What you are now seeing is this full court anti-Trump press, but it's late,"" Schriefer said. ""Trump is no more dangerous than he was in August.""
""Tomorrow night, if we believe the polls, he's going to win everything but Texas,"" Schriefer said. ""If that were any other candidate, on Wednesday morning the party would be rallying around him or her.""
Steve Schmidt, a GOP strategist who ran John McCain's campaign in 2008, said the current Republican reaction to Trump's electoral strength ""depends where each individual Republican is in their stages of grief.""
2016 candidates matchmaker
""Some people remain in the anger and denial phase while others are moving to acceptance,"" Schmidt said. He pointed out that while there is a lot of ""loose talk"" about the congressional wing of the Republican Party protesting Trump's nomination, congressional approval on ""a good day"" hovers around 15%.   
""It's not as if there's a wave of good feeling around members of Congress or governors who all of a sudden are standing on principle in opposition to Trump's candidacy,"" Schmidt said. ""You see a lot of trend lines converging at this moment that have been buffeting the Republican Party for a long time.""
Schmidt added Trump's rise reflects the divergence nationally within the GOP in recent years about the true meaning of conservatism.
""Stepping into that vacuum are the candidates who are now tearing at the fabric of the old conservative coalition,"" he said.
At the same time that there was a sense of resignation within some GOP quarters about Trump's glide path to the nomination, a number of GOP strategists pointed out that the party allowed him to succeed in large part by failing to coalesce around an alternative candidate last fall.
Despite all the rumors of an anti-Trump movement last year in the form of super PAC campaign or other sustained attacks, nothing ever materialized. 
""You have to help somebody win, not just hope somebody else loses,"" said Mike DuHaime, a GOP strategist who most recently advised Christie, but also worked as a strategist for McCain, former President George W. Bush and Rudy Giuliani, among others.
""Most people who sat on the sidelines last year, now they are wringing their hands because they can't believe they got to this point. They could have all gotten behind one candidate,"" he said.

The final day of campaigning before Super Tuesday brought a preview of the fractious year ahead for Republicans.
There was an ugly confrontation at Trump's rally at Radford, Virginia, after protesters interrupted him when a Secret Service employee appeared to put a photographer in a choke hold and throw him down on a table. (It was unclear what led to the altercation, which the Secret Service was investigating).
A collection of white supremacist groups placed a fresh round of robocalls in support of Trump in at least one Super Tuesday state -- Vermont -- a tactic they adopted before the New Hampshire primary.
In a final push to stop Trump, Cruz once again questioned the authenticity of Trump's conservative credentials, citing an unsubstantiated report in BuzzFeed that Trump had taken a softer tone on immigration in an off-the-record interview with The New York Times editorial board.
But even the Texas Senator acknowledged to reporters that his chief rival would likely do well Tuesday.
""I believe after Super Tuesday, we will see this race become more and more a two-man race,"" Cruz said. ""Donald is going to come out with a whole bunch of delegates. I believe we're going to come out with a whole bunch of delegates. And I think everyone else will be way, way behind. If that's the case, then it is time for the party to unify. Head to head, I beat Donald Trump and I beat him resoundingly,"" Cruz said.
Rubio, for his part, ridiculed Trump for not distancing himself from Duke and other white supremacists: ""He's unelectable now; he refused to criticize the KKK,"" the Florida Senator said in Tennessee.
""You say, 'David Duke' to me, I say, 'racist' immediately,"" Rubio said later at an Atlanta rally. ""Why wouldn't he condemn the Ku Klux Klan? There is no room in the Republican Party for members of Ku Klux Klan or racists like David Duke.""

Appearing with Rubio on stage, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she would not ""stop until we fight a man who chooses not to disavow the KKK, that is not a part of our party, that is not who we want as president.""
Trump insisted during a Monday interview on NBC's ""Today"" that he had not heard the question about Duke and alleged that XXX gave him a faulty earpiece for his Sunday interview on ""State of the Union.""
""I don't mind disavowing David Duke,"" he said. ""I disavowed David Duke the day before at a press conference.""
Trump continued slinging insults toward Rubio and Cruz, calling Rubio a ""con man"" and a ""little guy,"" while charging that Cruz has ""done nothing for Texas."" 
DuHaime noted that Trump, should he win, faces a difficult task in uniting the party, but he also predicted that the party would enter a new phase once faced with the reality of the choices in the election.
""Most likely,"" DuHaime said, ""the great unifier will be Hillary Clinton."""
Haley response to Trump attack: 'Bless your heart',http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/nikki-haley-donald-trump-bless-your-heart/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 0:29:17,,"South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Tuesday brushed aside a series of attacks by Donald Trump and his top lieutenants with a quintessentially southern response.
""Bless your heart,"" the Palmetto State governor tweeted at Trump, brushing him back with some sharp-elbowed charm.
Haley, who endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio before South Carolina's February 20 primary -- which Trump won handily -- has ramped up her criticism of the billionaire front-runner ahead of the Super Tuesday contests.
On Tuesday afternoon, Trump retweeted critical posts from two aides, both seeking to spread a video that first shows Haley in 2012 dismissing as a ""distraction"" calls for then-GOP hopeful Mitt Romney to release his tax returns, before cutting to a more recent rally when she demanded Trump do just that.
""The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!"" Trump tweeted to cap it off, though not before deleting a first attempt that misspelled her name.
In January, Haley used a portion of her official Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address to needle Trump.
""During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,"" Haley said, never mentioning him by name. ""We must resist that temptation. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.""

Here's how far the remaining candidates are from their parties' nominations,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/super-tuesday-results-primary-delegate-race/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 19:54:04,,"Republicans and Democrats boosted the front-runners on Super Tuesday, sending Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton out to considerable leads in their respective nominating contests -- while carving out a stark view of the road ahead for the rest of the field.
On the GOP side, Trump led the pack with seven victories, while Ted Cruz picked up three, including his home state of Texas. Rubio scored his first win of the season, in the Minnesota caucuses.
With some Tuesday night allocations still outstanding, Trump now leads the Republican field with 332 delegates. Cruz, at 230, sits in distant second and Rubio's 113 are good for third. John Kasich has just 27 delegates and Ben Carson, who will no longer be actively campaigning, has seven. A majority of the 2,472 total delegates -- 1,237 -- is needed to win the nomination. Although the nominee is not officially selected until the delegates meet and vote at the Republican National Convention. Here's how the race could go:

There will be opportunities for the underdogs to shake up the race in the coming weeks.
March 15 is the first date to watch. Until now, states have split their delegates between all of the finishers who reach a certain threshold. But primaries in delegate-rich Ohio and Florida are winner-take-all, meaning even a narrow victory for Rubio in his home state would net him a potentially game-changing 99 delegates. Same for Kasich, the Ohio governor, who stands to add 66 delegates if he can win his Buckeye State. Those are big ifs, since Trump appears strong in recent polling in both states.
In April, New York's 95 delegates will be distributed proportionally, as will California's 172 when it votes on June 7. Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota will award a total of 107 delegates in winner-take-all primaries on the same day, the last one on the primary schedule.
But with Cruz and Rubio pledging to stay in the race for the long haul (Kasich has suggested he will drop out if he loses Ohio), Trump's path to the nomination is looking clearer with every passing contest. 

Meanwhile, the Democratic race is beginning to shape up like a rout. With the help of a heavy slate of superdelegate support, Clinton is nearly halfway to a clinching majority. She currently holds 1,055 delegates, 587 of them pledged. Sanders has 418, with 397 bound to back him.
Here's what their race -- to a 2,383 delegate majority-- looks like on Wednesday:
Sanders' path is especially narrow because the Democratic Party does not offer any winner-take-all or hybrid votes. Every contest awards its delegates proportionally, so the Vermont senator will need to score significant victories on March 15 in the delegate-heavy Florida, Illinois and Ohio contests if he hopes to upend Clinton. Sanders will also look to a glut of caucuses -- in which he has performed well -- at the end of March, especially one in Washington state, where more than 100 delegates are at stake. 
First up though, another round of voting this weekend, with Democratic contests on Saturday in Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska. Maine follows on Sunday.
Republicans will head to the polls in Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Maine on Saturday. Puerto Rico votes on Sunday.

Hillary Clinton: Over $30 million raised in February,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/hillary-clinton-fundraising-february/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 21:42:40,,"Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign raised $30 million in the month of February, the campaign announced Wednesday, less than what Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign brought in for the month.
Clinton's haul leaves the campaign with $31 million cash on hand, a sizable bank roll for a campaign that will have to spend heavily during March's primaries and caucuses.
""We continue to beat every fundraising goal and, more importantly, make smart and efficient investments,"" said Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager. ""Grassroots support is truly powering this campaign as the majority of our fundraising came from online donations.""
He added, ""That support has helped Hillary Clinton gain momentum by winning three out of four contests in February, and eight on Super Tuesday. We move forward with a commanding pledged delegate lead and the resources we need to run a competitive race.""
Sanders campaign announced Tuesday that they raised $42 million in the month of February, an impressive haul for a candidate whose bright spot in the campaign trail has been fundraising. The haul is the most a 2016 candidate has raised in a single month.
RELATED: Bernie Sanders: Prolific Democratic Party fundraiser
Six million of that haul came on February 29, the final day of the month. Sanders' campaign made a concerted push to break $40 million haul.
""Working Americans chipping in a few dollars every week are changing the way campaigns in our country are financed,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""Not only are we going to smash Secretary Clinton's personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination.""
Sanders campaign spent heavily in January. Though he outraised Clinton in January, Sanders ended the month with $14.7 million in the bank. The Sanders campaign has yet to announce their cash on hand total for the month of February.
The former secretary of state's campaign, through the Hillary Victory Fund, also raised $4.4 million for the Democratic National Committee and state parties.

Hillary Clinton wins tennis match while GOP keeps mud wrestling (Opinion),http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/opinions/hillary-clinton-victory-super-tuesday-brazile/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 3:23:47,,"With all the drama and tragicomedy in the Republican primary, it's a little hard to get people to pay attention to what is going on in the Democratic side. But even though they are going about it in a much less sensational way, the Democrats are also choosing a candidate who is just as likely to be the next president of the United States; some would say more likely, given the current state of affairs.
 
The dysfunctional GOP race may be unfolding like a dream for journalists, pundits and political junkies, but meanwhile the Democratic primaries are unfolding exactly like a primary season is supposed to unfold.
 
A well-positioned front-runner is being challenged by an insurgent candidate who is running a campaign based on ideology, not hubris. Even if Sen. Bernie Sanders does not accrue enough delegates in the Super Tuesday sweepstakes, his candidacy has helped define the agenda, moved both the party and the front-runner to embrace serious proposals to help level the economic playing field, and energized a significant portion of the Democratic base.
 
Despite Sanders' success overall, this Super Tuesday was — as expected — a huge night for Hillary Clinton. Clinton won at least six states and will likely pick up delegates in states that Sanders carried like Oklahoma.
 
Clinton hasn't locked up the nomination, but she is locked into a groove that should get her there, barring any unforeseen circumstances. The demographics of Super Tuesday favored Clinton. 
The night was rich in states with large diverse populations including African-American populations in states like Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and Arkansas, and once more they came through for her in truly impressive numbers. She did well in more states than Sanders, and the states she did well in were the larger states. From here on out it will be a matter of steadily accumulating delegates, more than winning states.
 
And although Super Tuesday was significantly less than super for Bernie Sanders, things could improve for him going forward. The upcoming states have more of the white liberal voters who have flocked to him. And Sanders' fundraising has been by far the best of any candidate, meaning that he will have plenty of money as long as he can keep winning enough delegates to deny Clinton a clinch of the nomination. But it remains to be seen if Sanders' big Super Tuesday losses will make voters question his electability.
 
Both Hillary and Bernie would do well to ignore the raucous action taking place in the Republican race and focus on winning the hearts and minds of Democrats (while of course having their strategists making detailed plans for any contingency regarding the outcome in the GOP). 
 
The sound and fury of the Donald Trump phenomenon have excited the Republican base, leading to record turnout in virtually every state. Meanwhile, Democratic turnout is well below the numbers from 2008.
 
Part of that is the relative lack of spectacle: The Democratic race has been quite polite compared to the Republican contest, but then most hockey fights are quite polite compared to this Republican contest. Still, the Democratic nominee will have to close the enthusiasm gap, and they can best do that by not pivoting too soon, and concentrating on Democratic voters for now.

Hill Republicans walk tight line on Trump,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/donald-trump-hill-republicans/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 4:37:49,,"Congressional Republican leaders publicly rebuked Donald Trump on Tuesday for not quickly and firmly condemning the Ku Klux Klan in a recent XXX interview. But on the eve of Super Tuesday wins for Trump, those same leaders and most rank-and-file Republicans on Capitol Hill were careful about totally severing ties with the billionaire businessman, who is attracting support across a wide range of voters.
House Speaker Paul Ryan blasted Trump's handling of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke's support, telling reporters Tuesday, ""If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on people's prejudices.""
But when pressed if that meant he would oppose Trump if he became the nominee, Ryan repeated a line delivered by many Republican lawmakers around the Capitol recently: ""My plan is to support the nominee.""
Trump's dominance in the Republican primaries is wreaking havoc for many Republican lawmakers -- especially those up for re-election -- who may want to distance themselves from the trash-talking reality show star, but who are afraid it will turn off the voters who are showing up at the polls in record high numbers to vote for Trump.
RELATED: Super Tuesday 2016 results
Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who told XXX Monday that he worried Trump could be an ""albatross"" around down-ballot candidates, said Tuesday that candidates should do what they need to do to distance themselves from any controversy that could hurt their chances this fall.
""I think no matter who is elected president of the United States in November, it's important we maintain the Republican majority in the United States Senate. The Supreme Court vacancy, if nothing else, ought to cause people to reach that conclusion, so whatever people need to do in their individual races on order to maintain that majority, I wholeheartedly support,"" Cornyn said.
Democrats are confident Republican congressional candidates will be forced to deal with the ""baggage"" Trump or one of the other GOP presidential contenders would bring with them, said Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who heads the Senate Democrats' campaign organization.
""Whoever they nominate, if they're going to be out of the mainstream, which obviously he is, it puts them in a bind,"" Tester said.
Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, who is up for re-election, told reporters, ""I'll support the ticket and I'm not endorsing anyone."" But he declined to weigh in on questions about Trump, saying, ""I'm not going to talk about it any further than that,"" quipping on his way into a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans, ""I'm going in here because if I don't say something stupid to these questions, I might win.""
The third-ranking Republican senator, John Thune of South Dakota, who also is running for a new term, predicted there could be more splits from the GOP front-runner. 
""There are going to be times that you're not going to agree with the person that's leading your party"" and ""that's always the case and I don't think this year will be any different,"" Thune said.
""I intend to support the nominee. I've said that from the very beginning,"" said Thune, who said he would like Trump to ""clarify"" his KKK comments.
Trump, however, suggested Tuesday night that he would ""get along great with Congress"" -- but that he would pursue his agenda regardless of whether he had their support.
""Paul Ryan, I don't know him well, but I'm sure I'm going to get along great with him,"" Trump said. ""But if I don't, he's going to have to pay a big price, OK?"" Trump said in a victory speech.

A small group of Republican senators -- notably none of whom are up for re-election this year -- were especially critical of Trump on Tuesday.
""It's not hard to denounce the KKK. That does not take any thought whatsoever,"" said Maine Sen. Susan Collins.
""It would be very difficult to support Donald Trump,"" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona.
""It's a concern to have Trump on the top of the ticket. It's a concern for anyone on the ballot,"" Flake said. ""Some of us feel we have a responsibility to speak out when he makes outlandish, crazy statements like the Muslim ban or a number of others.""
""I don't believe Trump supports the KKK or is a racist, I just think he's playing politics in a very clever fashion and he's going to get burned here,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who also sought the Republican nomination for president before dropping out. ""Maybe someone told him you don't need to go there, you may lose a few votes, and he tried to recalculate.""
Graham said he thinks voters will be fair and won't hold Republican Senate candidates -- like his friend John McCain, who is running for re-election in Arizona -- accountable for Trump's controversial statements and positions. 
Freshman Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska has been the most critical of Trump of any GOP senator. He said candidates for the House and Senate have to ""run to win your election.""
""The only thing you can do is control the things you can control. And so our candidates are raising money, they're organizing, they're carrying their own message in their own states and they're going to have to put together a winning campaign there irrespective of what happens on the national ticket,"" he said.
Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who backs Sen. Marco Rubio for president, reiterated his position that he would back whoever the Republican nominee is.
Hatch downplayed any fallout for GOP candidates potentially running on the same ticket as Trump because congressional candidates can speak out and differentiate their position.
""I think it's up to us to make it clear that we don't tolerate those types of racist organizations and I don't know many people who would believe that we do. I think deep down, I don't think Donald Trump tolerates it either. I think he is just inexperienced in expressing himself at things like that.""

Sen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, told reporters he would back whoever the GOP nominates for president, but when pressed about Trump, joked, ""I'm working on Tom Selleck to get in the race.""
Asked if he had concerns about Trump's recent comments, Roberts, a Rubio supporter, responded, ""which ones?""
Hatch said it's inevitable that Republicans will have to answer questions about any controversial comments from the front-runner in their party, but referring to Trump, he said, ""he does make more than the average person, put it that way.""
Rep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, was pushing for Rubio and Cruz to come up with a unity ticket to counter Trump. But on Tuesday he said his party faces a ""mathematical problem rather than a political problem, and a divided conservative base may be overwhelmed by those who are looking at the bright political shiny object that has anything but a conservative record.""
Franks said he would face an ""impossible conundrum"" if Trump wins the nomination, but told reporters he would vote for him if he is the candidate facing Hillary Clinton in November.

Making history: Clinton and Trump blaze trails,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/super-tuesday-history-was-made-gergen/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 13:55:10,,"Even as we in the commentariat dig into the entrails of Super Tuesday voting  -- for example, asking how many left-handed, 24-year-old Lutherans caucused in Minnesota and how they voted -- we should not overlook the larger significance of this year's pivotal moment.
We witnessed history in the making this Super Tuesday: For the first time in the American story, a woman nearly wrapped up the presidential nomination of a major political party, and on the other side, a total renegade came close to clinching the presidential nomination of the opposing party. Historians will long remember these days.  
Bernie Sanders still has a mathematical possibility of wresting the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton, of course, but her victories in seven states Tuesday has made his path incredibly steep. Sanders' best reason for going forward in other states is not to win the crown but to gain ever greater influence for the Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party.  
The close parallels between Clinton's victory speech and his on Tuesday night illustrated just how much he has already brought her in his direction; think now of how much bargaining power he may eventually exercise over the Democratic platform and convention.
But among most Democrats, the night truly belonged to Clinton. After a stumbling start to her campaign in Iowa and especially New Hampshire, she has won a series of stunningly large victories -- by a dozen points or more -- that are truly impressive. Win or lose in November, Clinton is now leaving footprints in the sand for generations of future women.  
On the other side, Donald Trump on Super Tuesday won a series of convincing victories that have brought him closer to winning the nomination of his party than any business leader since Wendell Willkie. That was in 1940 when Willkie stormed the Republican convention; he went on to lose to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the general but was well-remembered for the bipartisan help he gave to FDR as war came.
No business leader has captured the imagination of voters since. Mitt Romney was a CEO, too, but he won the GOP nomination in 2012 because he had been a successful governor, not because of his corporate experience. Indeed, his corporate leadership was a matter of controversy rather than strength.
Even Willkie was no Trump -- he was chief of a utilities company, which is akin to running as an accountant. Trump is the exact opposite, gleefully breaking all conventionalities with his bombast, narcissism and seeming indifference to the intricacies of running a powerful, complex government. 
Yet here is Trump with 10 victories in the first 15 states to vote. It remains hard to imagine him as the nominee of the Republican Party, but it is even harder to see who will beat him now. Historians may one day ask who has shaped the political landscape of America more: the first woman nominee of a party or the first celebrity CEO to seize the reins of a party.  
Clinton and Trump haven't won their crowns yet, but after Super Tuesday, they should certainly feel the weight of responsibility bearing down upon them. And one hopes that in their quiet moments, they are examining their souls and asking not only how they can make history -- but more importantly, how they can bend its arc toward a better world.

"NASCAR CEO, drivers endorse Donald Trump",http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-nascar-endorsements/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 1:03:07,,"NASCAR's chief executive and several NASCAR drivers endorsed Donald Trump on Monday, just one day before a cluster of Southern states vote in the GOP's Super Tuesday contests.
Brian France, the racing association's CEO, appeared Monday alongside Trump during a rally at Valdosta State University, touting the Republican front-runner's success in his business and personal life.
""You know about his winning in business and success. I'm gonna tell you, he wins with his family,"" said France, who noted that he's known Trump for more than two decades.
""That's how I judge a winner,"" France added, pointing to how well Trump's children have turned out.
The endorsement marked a stark contrast with how NASCAR reacted to Trump's controversial comments this summer about undocumented Mexican immigrants -- calling them criminals and ""rapists"" -- when the racing association decided to change the location for its postseason banquet away from the Trump National Doral and to another venue.  
Bill Elliott, a retired champion NASCAR driver, also joined Trump on stage, saying that he's ""all for"" what Trump has said he will do for the United States as president.
""For what he can do I think for our country, I'm all for it. We need a change guys, that's all there is to it,"" Elliott said.
Elliott's son and two other current NASCAR drivers also endorsed Trump Monday.
The endorsements could give Trump a boost Tuesday, when more than a dozen states, including several southern states like Georgia, where NASCAR is especially popular, make their choice for Republican nominee known.
NASCAR's 2015 season averaged 5.1 million viewers, according to the ESPN-owned Jayski.com website.
Thanking his latest endorsers, Trump noted that ""they have guts.""
Moments earlier, Trump opened his rally praising the stock car racing association.
""I love NASCAR. Do we love NASCAR?"" Trump asked the crowd.
The endorsement comes on the heels of a series of high-profile endorsements for the billionaire Republican presidential candidate who is increasingly viewed as most likely to become his party's nominee.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions have also endorsed Trump in the final days of campaigning leading up to the crucial Super Tuesday contests.

Political Prediction Market: What are Clinton and Trump's odds?,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/political-prediction-market-super-tuesday/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 20:45:32,,"With voters heading to the polls and to caucus in 12 states across the country, Pivit has been monitoring the Political Prediction Market, which is powered by the predictions of 100,000 users in conjunction with publicly available polling and real-money wagering market data, to assess the 2016 field.
 
Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump hold substantial leads in nearly all of the Super Tuesday primary markets.  Both candidates are expected to rack up major victories, according to the prediction market, and add to their delegate counts. But there are also some deeper insights  in the prediction market data:  

Hillary Clinton is currently at 95% to win the Democratic nomination -- her highest odds to date. Does this make her inevitable? There appears no clear path for Bernie Sanders to claim the nomination, at least according to the data on the market. Even if Sanders wins the Massachusetts primary on Tuesday - he currently has 27% odds -- he likely would not break 10% odds to win the nomination. The silver lining states for Sanders: Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont.  Sanders is at 99% to win the Vermont primary, and has seen marked gains in Oklahoma primary market.  Sanders finds himself at 47% odds to win in Oklahoma as of this afternoon -- that's up 33% over the past two days.
 
But even if he wins in Oklahoma and Vermont, it won't be enough for him to make gains in the hunt for the nomination.  If the Super Tuesday market odds hold, we expect Clinton's odds to win the nomination to hit 98% by the end of the night.
 

Donald Trump has pulled way ahead of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz following his increasingly big wins in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.  Trump is now at 80% odds to win the GOP nomination, with Rubio and Cruz trailing at 16% and 2%, respectively.  
 
Additionally, Trump leads all Super Tuesday primary markets (except for Texas) with an average of 80-90% odds to win.  
 
Rubio's last hope:  One possible way forward for Rubio would be for him to win delegates in the Texas primary -- he needs to get 20% of the vote total - and breathe life into a potential upset in the Florida primary on March 15.  
 
But even that path is a tough one for the Florida senator.  
In Texas, Cruz holds a major lead to win his home state -- at 81% odds.  Trump is at 19%. If both Rubio and Cruz manage to walk away with delegates tonight from the Lone Star State, then Florida becomes key.
The Florida primary market currently shows Trump withy 91% odds to win, and Rubio trailing with 8% odds. It will take a Herculean effort to put Florida in play for Rubio, and that effort starts tonight in Texas.
 
Cruz's last hope: While he is the favorite to win in Texas, according to the prediction market data, Cruz does not have strong odds to win the nomination. But if Rubio doesn't win any delegates in the TX primary, Cruz could come out with the lead in delegate count; some in the political class say that arguably gives him a proxy to challenge Trump.
 

The most volatile markets right now are:
Trump to Win TX Primary
Sanders to Win MA Primary
Cruz to Win AR Primary.
Volatile markets are a canary in the coal mine for potential upsets;  we'll be watching these markets in particular as polls close to see if Trump, Sanders or Cruz can pull off the win.
 

Assuming there are no surprises in any of the bevy of states holding contests tonight, we'll end the night with voters focused on a likely matchup of Clinton and Trump in the general election.  Pivit has been tracking the odds for the current slate of candidates to win the Presidency, and Clinton holds the lead.
 
Clinton is at 63% odds to win the Presidency, with Trump a distant second at 27%.  
 
Looking at it from the Democratic vs. Republican perspective, the Democrats are trading at 63% odds to win the Presidency, with Republicans at 37% odds.

"R.I.P. religious right, and other Super Tuesday takeaways",http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/religion-super-tuesday/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 17:35:24,,"Was it a coming-out party for atheists or a funeral dirge for the religious right?  
In an election year full of twists, Super Tuesday didn't disappoint. Voters in 12 states went to the polls, handing victories to the GOP's Donald Trump and Democrats' Hillary Clinton. 
Exit polls can't tell us everything about Tuesday. They didn't plumb the depth of religious commitment among Trump's evangelical flock, or measure the size of the ""God gap"" between supporters of Bernie Sanders and Clinton.
But in broad strokes, the exit polls paint a picture of a radically shifting religious landscape.
With that in mind, here are four big takeaways from Super Tuesday.

For years, journalists have been writing the religious right's obituary, only to see the movement rise from the grave during general elections and rally behind the GOP's presidential candidate.
But the religious right has never seen a hammer quite like Trump, and on Super Tuesday he finally nailed the coffin shut. 
In the days before Super Tuesday, conservative Christian leaders cautioned, cajoled and pleaded with evangelicals to reject Trump, saying the New York businessman epitomized the opposite of their values. 
Tuesday was supposed to be the religious right's last stand, a day when the Bible Belt would enter the voting booth and christen the most God-fearing candidate. Christian conservatives were the last best hope to halt Trump's momentum. 
They didn't.  
According to exit polls, Trump won a plurality of evangelical and born-again Christians in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. 
In several states, even evangelicals who said that it's important for a candidate to share their religious values voted for Trump. That's a direct repudiation of the message Christian leaders have been shouting from the rooftops: The thrice-married mogul more at home in casinos than churches is not one of us!  
""Religious right R.I.P,"" Mark Silk, a professor of religion and public life at Trinity College, wrote on Wednesday morning.  
The movement died of ""natural causes,"" Silk said. Its founding leaders, like the Rev. Jerry Falwell, have died or retired; its organizational weight has withered; its crusades, such as the push against same-sex marriage, appear to be lost causes. 
But the religious right's fatal wounds were self-inflicted, said David Campbell, an expert on religion and politics at the University of Notre Dame. 
""The religious right is reaping what they have sown: By drawing religious people into politics, people began to put their political preferences ahead of their religious values."" 

In the days before Super Tuesday, Hillary Clinton spent a lot of time in churches. Last Sunday alone, she attended two services in Memphis, where she preached about ""love and kindness."" 
It was a smart strategy in the South, where many voters, particularly African-Americans, are deeply devout. And it appears to have worked. 
In Alabama, 92% of people who said they attend religious services more than once a week voted for Clinton. In Georgia, more than 80% of frequent worshippers broke for her. Those numbers also held in Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Clinton won all of those states. 

When political scientists talk about a ""God gap"" in American politics, they often mean the religious gulf between Christian conservatives and liberal Democrats. 
In 2016, though, a sizable ""God gap"" has appeared within the Democratic Party itself. 
As noted above, Clinton has cleaned up among the devoutly religious, not only on Super Tuesday but also in South Carolina in February. 
Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, appears to be drawing deep support from people who rarely step foot inside a house of prayer. 
Sanders attracted a majority of voters who don't regularly attend worship services in Arkansas and Texas, and came close (46%) in Virginia, helping him win delegates even where he lost states. 
The four states that Sanders did win -- Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont -- all have one thing in common: a large number of religiously unaffiliated voters, or ""nones."" 
We don't have exit poll data on voters' religion in those states, but other polls suggest religious skeptics are breaking for Sanders. 

Super Tuesday was supposed to be Ted Cruz's ""Southern firewall,"" when evangelicals in the Bible Belt would come out in droves to support one of their own. That plan seemed successful in Texas, Cruz's home state, and neighboring Oklahoma. 
But Cruz was badly beaten by Trump among evangelicals in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia. (Exit polls show a virtual tie in Arkansas.) In those states, Trump bested Cruz among voters who said it's important that a candidate shares their Christian values, evidence that the Texas senator has failed to forge an emotional connection with evangelicals.
Perhaps the main problem is that, from the first days of his campaign, the most dramatic religious conversion story Cruz has told Christians isn't about himself; it's about his father, Rafael. 
In other words, Cruz may have a ""testimony problem.""

Romney wants a word about the race,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/mitt-romney-to-speak-on-state-of-the-2016-presidential-race-thursday/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 18:31:06,,"Mitt Romney will speak Thursday on ""the state of the 2016 presidential race,"" he said in a press release.
The 2012 Republican nominee will speak at 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday at the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics Forum, the same day that the remaining GOP presidential candidates are schedule to debate in Detroit. 
Romney's remarks come at a time of deep soul-searching for the Republican establishment as they consider ways to take on front-runner Donald Trump, who dominated yesterday's Super Tuesday contests. 
In Washington, Utah's Sen. Orrin Hatch told XXX ""If the convention is locked up, there's a possibility"" Romney would run for president. 
Romney has been especially vocal in criticizing Trump in recent days, raising the possibility that the billionaire's tax returns could contain a ""bombshell"" and slamming him for not disavowing white supremacists in an interview Sunday with XXX 's Jake Tapper.
Trump later said he'd had a faulty earpiece, and noted he'd condemned former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke -- who Tapper had asked about -- both before and after that interview.
Still, Romney hit him on Twitter the following day, saying: ""A disqualifying & disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America."" 
New York Rep. Peter King told XXX he wasn't aware of any ""inside information"" related to what Romney will say at Thursday's speech but did express concern over Trump's momentum in the presidential race.
""His whole campaign is all based around Donald Trump and his personality,"" King, who has endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said, adding that he plans to be at the Republican convention this summer. "
Ron Paul blasts state of 2016 race,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/election-center-2016/ron-paul-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-2016-race/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 17:57:18,,"Former Republican presidential candidate and libertarian champion Ron Paul lamented the state of the 2016 race on Tuesday. 
""My biggest beef is that from a libertarian view point, there is no meaningful difference between (Hillary Clinton) and (Donald Trump). I mean they both support the military industrial complex, the federal reserve, deficits and entitlements, and and an invasion of our privacy,"" Paul told XXX's Carol Costello on ""Newsroom."" ""It's super nationalistic populism versus socialism.""
The former Texas congressman's comments come as voters flock to the polls in Super Tuesday states. According to a recent XXX/ORC national poll, Trump leads to the Republican race with 49% support, while Clinton tops Democratic rival Bernie Sanders 55% to 38%.
Paul also likened Trump to Sanders, saying they are both ""authoritarian."" 
""He's a big voter for militarism, but had one vote he could brag about,"" Paul said describing Sanders and his vote against the Iraq War. ""He's an authoritarian of a different color, but Trump is a super authoritarian."" 
Paul also blasted Trump for refusing to disavow an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke. 
""That's unbelievable to me,"" Paul said. ""They're evil, they're monsters ... yet this is going to be the issue of the day."" 
Trump is under fire from Republicans and Democrats for not formally disavowing the Ku Klux Klan during an interview with XXX's Jake Tapper on Sunday's ""State of the Union."" He has since done so several times.
Paul told Costello he has no plans to endorse anyone in the race. His son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, suspended his campaign in February. 
"
Some see strategy in Trump's comments on race,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-kkk-super-tuesday/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 1:00:08,,"As Republican candidates and top GOP officials spent a second day condemning -- and sitting in disbelief -- of Donald Trump's decision Sunday to decline repeated invitations to disavow the Ku Klux Klan, there are more than a few that think it's a bald strategic play by the billionaire businessman.
Trump's comments coming so close to Super Tuesday, a primary day littered with contests across the deep South, rang alarm bells for some Republicans who saw them as an intentional dog whistle. 
""As the guy who is positioning himself as the smartest guy in politics, he sure plays dumb a lot,"" says Doug Heye, a veteran Republican operative who announced in January he wouldn't support Trump if he was the Republican nominee. 
Heye's position has since caught fire in recent days, as the ""#NeverTrump"" movement has spread across Twitter, with top conservatives, including Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, have pledged not to support the nominee. 
Trump's history during the primary on inflammatory race issues is one of the top reasons many give for their refusal to support his candidacy. Yet Trump, while never openly courting the fringe groups, has nonetheless garnered their support through his immigration policy proposals and bellicose rhetoric.  
In the day since his interview with XXX's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" Trump has disavowed David Duke, the former KKK Grand Wizard, supporting his campaign. He blamed his refusal to do so Sunday on a bad earpiece, even as he repeated Duke's name multiple times back to Tapper. 

But it's more than the most recent dust-up that has some convinced Trump's actions -- or lack thereof -- are intentional. 
""Don't tell me he doesn't know who the KKK is,"" Marco Rubio said at a rally Monday. ""We cannot be the party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.""
Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, accused Trump of participating in the ""coddling of repugnant bigotry."" 
""It's clearly intentional,"" said an operative for a rival campaign, who asked for anonymity to discuss the subject without their candidate's permission. ""And it's just so blatant."" 
The same operative pointed to Trump's 2000 interview where with NBC's Matt Lauer where Trump called Duke ""a bigot, a racist, a problem."" 
""What on earth changed in 16 years? The electoral map, I guess,"" the operative said.
On Monday, Trump said in an interview with NBC's ""Today Show"" he didn't ""mind disavowing anyone. I disavowed Duke the day before at a major news conference.""

For Trump, the support of white supremacists is not a new element of his campaign, but he has never touted associations with the groups or in any way publicly courted their support. Yet his tweets, public comments and answers -- or, in many non-answers -- to questions about the groups have at times served to legitimize efforts of such groups that support him. 
In the days before the New Hampshire primary, robocalls touting Trump's campaign were funded by a super PAC affiliated organized by a group, the American Freedom Party, which says it ""shares the customs and heritage of the European American people."" 
Trump's campaign said at the time the candidate ""has disavowed all Super PACs offering their support and continues to do so."" 

Perhaps most notably, any flap related to race -- and there have been plenty -- seems to either bounce off Trump or only galvanize his support. He carries large leads in many of the so-called SEC primary states into Super Tuesday and a new nationwide XXX/ORC survey finds Trump's lead is dominant, and his support tops that of his four remaining opponents combined.
For Republicans like Heye though, the most recent dust-up only serves to raise further concern about the direction a Trump-led GOP, which has grown increasingly more likely in recent weeks, would head.  
""It picks at what's been a very, very bad scab for Republicans for a long time,"" Heye said. ""I think the party if they nominate him will be committing an abortion on itself.""

Super PAC pitches GOP donors on plan to stop Trump,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/republican-donald-trump-super-pac-call/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 2:44:01,,"Washington (CNN)Katie Packer, the Republican operative leading the anti-Donald Trump super PAC, pitched her strategy to stop the Republican front-runner on a call with more than 50 GOP donors and power brokers Tuesday, including those with ties to the campaigns of Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Chris Christie. 
Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, who was Chris Christie's national finance co-chair, and Brian Baker, a Republican operative connected to the Ricketts family, both spoke on the call, sources who were on the call told XXX. 
READ: HP chief Meg Whitman calls Trump 'unfit to be president'
It came on Super Tuesday, as Trump prepared to build on his lead -- and Republican loyalists increasingly fretted the prospect that Trump will run away with the nomination.   
Packer, a veteran of Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign who launched Our Principles PAC, told XXX that ""it concerns me"" that Super Tuesday's results might not make her task any easier by knocking any Republicans out of the field.
But, she added, ""if the worst-case scenario is we have to take it all the way to the convention, that's fine by me.""
Still, it's not clear that establishment Republicans have settled on a single strategy to defeat Trump -- a reality Packer acknowledged. 
""The question is, do people feel like that's best executed by giving to a campaign that they're invested in or another candidate's super PAC or our effort?"" Packer said. ""We're not particularly greedy about it coming to our effort, although we have had a lot of enthusiasm for our effort.""
Packer argued that Trump has not faced a sustained negative advertising campaign. She pointed out that so far, of the $215 million spent on the air in the GOP race, only $9 million has been funneled into attack ads against Trump -- less than the $10 million Romney's campaign spent in a single week in a single state, Florida, to undercut Newt Gingrich in 2012.
""The reality is that there has been no sustained campaign against this guy until last Thursday,"" she said.
The new push comes after the group aired ads against Trump in Iowa, but couldn't raise money to continue after Trump's second-place finish there.
Packer's super PAC also ramped up its efforts this week by hiring ex-Jeb Bush campaign aide Tim Miller as its communications director. 
The group is already on the air nationally with an ad that launched Tuesday blasting ""Trump University."" It's airing on XXX and Fox News, as well as more broadly in Florida, Illinois and Michigan -- three key states that vote later this month.
The attacks on Trump could sound like the 2012 hits on Romney's work at Bain Capital. 
Previewing her line of attack against Trump, Packer said: ""This guy isn't a conservative. He probably isn't even a Republican. He is a con man who is incredibly vulnerable in the general election once Democrats get their hands on him.""

Super Tuesday: How much each vote cost the candidates,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/super-tuesday-cost-of-votes/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 14:08:15,,"Super Tuesday is wrapped, and the votes are tallied. Here's a look at what each vote cost each candidate.
Cost estimates come from CMAG/Kantar Media and represent spending on TV advertising in Super Tuesday states from January 1, 2015 to March 2, 2016.

You can't buy much for 15 cents these days -- unless you're Ben Carson. 
As the race for the Republican nomination went national on Super Tuesday, the former neurosurgeon turned out to be the best bargain hunter in the race. He spent a mere $75,000 on TV advertising in the states holding caucuses and primaries on Tuesday, but still managed to garner 489,588 votes, for an average cost of 15 cents per vote.
Of course, Carson is barely figuring in the actual nomination battle.
The night's big winner was Donald Trump, and he continues to rake in victories on the cheap -- boosted by jaw-dropping amounts of free media. He spent about $2.1 million across the Super Tuesday states and racked up 2,923,184 votes, for a budget-conscious 72 cents per vote.
The two men fighting to be the alternative to Trump poured a lot more cash into the race, with less to show for it. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and his PAC allies spent $9.9 million to win 1,867,264 votes, for a generous $5.30 per vote. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and supporters shelled out $9.8 million and got 2,483,553 votes. That works out to $3.95 per vote.
And finally, Ohio Gov. John Kasich continues to be hoping for a landscape shift that will help make him the nominee. If he does manage it, he'll have done it on the cheap. He and his allies spent $320,000 on Super Tuesday advertising and took 538,996 votes, for an average cost of 59 cents per vote.

On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the winner, not only in the number of states and votes she won, but in cost per vote. She and her allies spent about $7.83 million across the Super Tuesday states, and she captured 3,534,665 votes. That's $2.16 per vote.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders spent slightly less -- $6.1 million -- and took 2,264,165 votes, for a cost of $2.69 per vote.

Super Tuesday: What to watch,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/super-tuesday-what-to-watch/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 11:27:19,,"Super Tuesday is here, and as the presidential race goes national, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are hoping to put themselves way ahead. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio need strong turnouts to show they can fight Trump over the long-term. And Bernie Sanders hopes to stem Clinton's momentum with a few wins of his own.
Voters of both parties in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia go the polls or caucus Tuesday. Democrats also caucus in Colorado and Republicans will do the same in Alaska.
Here's what to watch on the biggest day yet in the 2016 race: 

Trump is cruising nationally -- with 49% support compared to Rubio's 16% and Cruz's 15% in a new XXX/ORC poll, giving him his largest lead yet. 
He's likely to blow out the competition in Massachusetts, Tennessee and Alabama, polls there show. 
But it's also possible Trump could win all 11 states -- or come close to it. And if he does, it would leave other Republicans with very little hope of catching up. 
READ: GOP's Trump revolt: Too little, too late?
Cruz and Rubio have spent recent days leveling a dizzying array of charges against Trump. Cruz has raised his decades-old ties to mafia bosses who controlled New York's construction industry and prodded Trump to reveal what he told The New York Times in an off-the-record conversation about immigration. Rubio has hammered Trump as a ""con artist,"" pointing to his hiring of undocumented immigrants on construction projects and his namesake university. And Trump ran into trouble when he failed to disavow the KKK and white supremacist David Duke to XXX's Jake Tapper. 
If Trump runs the table on Super Tuesday, or comes close, it'll be yet more proof that attacks and insults -- true or not; subtle or direct -- only make him stronger. 
It'll also leave him with a massive delegate lead and a weakened crop of competitors. 

He hasn't been shy about it: Ted Cruz says Super Tuesday is ""the most important day in the entire election."" 
After days of relentlessly building expectations, the pressure is now on the Texas senator to perform.
The first big question: Does he win Texas -- and by a big margin? If Cruz loses his home state, it will be both embarrassing and mean he's in for a very though night nationwide, leaving him with no path forward in the campaign. 
The second big question: Does he win anywhere else? 
Cruz's strategy of racking up Southern and evangelical votes has been wrecked by Trump. Now, Cruz is trying to win delegates wherever he can. Four states could represent Cruz's best hopes: Oklahoma and Arkansas, his two neighboring states; Alaska, with its libertarian streak; and Georgia, a delegate-rich state that all three leading contenders see as in play. 
He's also looking over his shoulder at Rubio. If Cruz wins Texas and at least one more state, and Rubio doesn't notch any Super Tuesday victories at all, it would put the Texas senator in much better position to argue that he is the true Trump alternative in the field. 

Rubio captured second place over Cruz in South Carolina. Then he consolidated the GOP establishment's support after elbowing Jeb Bush out of the race. Then he unleashed the most vicious attack on Trump of any candidate yet, in person, on the debate stage last Thursday and continued his barrage of insults over the weekend — including some Trump-level personal zingers.
Now, he needs wins. 
For all the hype his campaign has received in recent days, Rubio has gone 0-for-4 in the early states -- and unlike Cruz, whose home state votes, there are no locks on Tuesday's map. 
Rubio's best bet is probably Virginia, where the GOP establishment makes up much of the northern portion of the state. 
READ: Who is Marco Rubio?
He also hopes to compete in Georgia, where he could win in the Atlanta suburbs. Rubio campaigned there Monday alongside South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a particularly effective surrogate. 
But a nightmare scenario for the Florida senator and his backers is an 0-for-11 night, coupled with Cruz notching more than one victory. That would continue the race's status quo -- with Trump as the commanding front-runner and the rest of the party's electorate split between the two freshman senators.
Rubio won't be leaving the race anytime soon, no matter what happens Tuesday. He's got money, establishment backing and his home state of Florida votes on March 15. 
But his path is increasingly narrow. Ohio Gov. John Kasich remaining in the race complicates not just the Buckeye State -- another winner-take-all March 15 primary -- but other Great Lakes states like Michigan and Illinois, where Rubio also needs strong showings. 
READ: John Kasich: 'Nobody's pressuring me to get out of the race'

The lay of the Democratic land is pretty clear. 
Clinton, coming off a massive 48-point South Carolina blowout win, is likely to parlay her strength among minority voters into wins in Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas. 
Sanders, meanwhile, is targeting states that are whiter and, mostly, farther north: Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont. But only Vermont is a guaranteed win for him. If Clinton can carry her success in South Carolina across the rest of the South and pick off a couple of Sanders' targets, he'd be hard-pressed to catch her. 
And even if he locks them in, Clinton's stronger states outnumber his, nearly two to one, in the delegate count. 
Barring disaster, Clinton's delegate lead is certain to grow Tuesday. And given her long list of superdelegate endorsements, she could make it tough for Sanders to ever catch up. 
The real date Clinton and her supporters have circled on the calendar is March 15. It's when Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri all vote -- and when Clinton's backers hope they can land the knockout blow. 
She's already looking forward to the general election, taking on Trump in speeches while de-emphasizing attacks against Sanders. 
READ: Clinton to lay off Sanders a little ahead of Super Tuesday

Sanders is set to raise $40 million in February, according to the campaign, so he will be competitive for the foreseeable future. The problem is he needs to find new voters. 
His New Hampshire win and close call in Iowa came on the backs of white voters. But faced with a more diverse electorate in the past two races, he has faltered. Minority voters in Las Vegas helped Clinton win the caucuses there and the primary in South Carolina. 
Sanders has worked for months to reach out to minority voters -- particularly, in recent days, by portraying Republican attacks on President Barack Obama as racially motivated. But to keep the delegate count close, he'll have to succeed Tuesday where he failed just Saturday. 
It's an increasingly important challenge for Sanders. After Tuesday, the next major states to vote are Michigan, followed by five on March 15, all with significant minority populations.  
There are four key states to watch for Sanders on Tuesday. Wins in Colorado and Oklahoma could bode well for Sanders' ability to rack up delegates in more rural western states throughout the latter half of March and early April. A win in Minnesota is a good sign as Great Lakes states begin to vote. And a win in Massachusetts would underscore the strength of his support among liberals -- the types of people he hopes will eventually help him win California, and therefore, the nomination, on June 7.
But that's a very rosy scenario that doesn't look likely right now.

The backlash against Christie,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/chris-christie-donald-trump-backlash/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 16:21:47,,"They're calling Chris Christie ""an embarrassment."" 
An ""utter disgrace."" 
And they're calling for the New Jersey governor -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's most high-profile supporter -- to step down. 
The morning after Trump swept through Super Tuesday primaries, taking seven states and boasting that he will unify a Republican Party upended by his candidacy, Christie was ridiculed for his decision to support the real estate developer-turned-political force. 
Even before his positioning behind Trump during his victory speech spawned the hashtag #FreeChrisChristie, his endorsement drew a slew of irate hometown newspaper editorials that ran Tuesday.
""We're fed up with his opportunism, we're fed up with his hypocrisy,"" wrote six Gannett-owned newspapers, including the Asbury Park Press, the Cherry Hill Courier-Post and the Morristown Daily Record, in a joint editorial asking for Christie to quit or be recalled. 
""We're disgusted with his endorsement of Donald Trump after he spent months on the campaign trail trashing him, calling him unqualified by temperament and experience to be president,"" they wrote.
RELATED: Chris Christie steals Donald Trump's show
A Washington Post opinion writer said that Christie, once beloved as a straight-talker who got things done, had ruined his reputation. The New Hampshire Union-Leader declared that they'd been wrong to endorse him for governor. ""Rather than standing up to the bully, Christie bent on his knee,"" the New Hampshire-based paper wrote.  
And a poll conducted last week showed Christie's support among voters has slid from a lackluster 33% to a limp 27%. 
Christie pulled out of the presidential race on February 10 after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary. But after stepping out of the political ring, Christie endorsed Trump on February 26, declaring him the candidate most likely to beat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. 
Major political organizers and donors have chastised Christie, with his own national finance co-chair, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, summing it up as ""an astonishing display of political opportunism."" 
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a fellow Republican, told ABC on Sunday that ""none of us understand why he did this."" 
Former Republican New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman told the Newark Star-Ledger that she was ""ashamed"" Christie would endorse someone who has ""employed the kind of hate-mongering and racism that Trump has.""
Christie hasn't done himself any favors, trying to shut down reporters on Monday who wanted to ask questions about Trump's hesitation in disavowing an endorsement from white supremacist leader David Duke. 
""No, I won't permit you to"" ask questions about that, Christie said. 
Perhaps the most brutal excoriation has come online. 
News media and viewers alike took note of Christie's slack-jawed quizzical look as he stood behind Trump during the candidate's Super Tuesday speech in Florida. 
An MSNBC tweet said, ""caption this: What was on Chris Christie's mind during Trump's #SuperTuesday speech?""
""The Daily Show"" provided one answer, showing a series of screengrabs of Christie's odd expression with subtitles. ""What have I done?"" one reads. ""Dear God. What have I DONE?"" 
Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash tweeted his answer: ""it's staged to look like a hostage situation."" Soon enough, the hashtag #FreeChrisChristie was zinging through cyberspace.

The best of the Super Tuesday speeches,http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2016/03/02/best-of-super-tuesday-speeches-wrap-origwx-nws.cnn,cnn,3/2/2016 6:20:45,,
"Trump is huge, and he isn't going away",http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/super-tuesday-conservatives-stanley/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 5:33:46,,"Donald Trump won Super Tuesday. All other analysis feels like a distraction at this stage. 
He is ahead. He is the dominant candidate
Yet, despite this, the GOP continues to throw everything it's got at the front-runner. And continues to tear itself apart. It's become a kind of madness.
The Virginia primary result was a good illustration of the mood of the Republican Party. Here was a chance for Marco Rubio really to break through. He was doing well among late deciders. But as the evening wore on and the votes came in, it became obvious he wasn't going to do it. 
Rubio won the college educated, the overspill from Washington  and the wealthy. But Trump dominated among rural dwellers and in the suburbs. Some analysis says that John Kasich stole enough votes to deny Rubio the state, but why assume that all of Kasich's voters would've backed him?
By the time Virginia was called, one could feel the momentum drain away from Rubio -- even as he would go on to win one state: Minnesota. Will the energy ever come back? It's hard to see how or why. 
He's enjoyed every advantage: a week of great headlines, the support of the establishment, a consensus that he's the best placed to beat Hillary Clinton. Despite this, he failed to make his mark on Super Tuesday and is trailing Trump in his home state of Florida. 
And yet the only alternatives left in the race are John Kasich, with little appeal outside the North, and Ted Cruz, whom moderates broadly despise. The most rational thing to do right now might be for Kasich and Rubio to drop out and back Cruz -- the anti-Trump person who has won the most. And yet the most rational thing doesn't even seem to be on the table.
We know that the GOP is looking for answers. Insiders have tried to persuade others to drop out -- an approach that has been stymied by ego. How else to explain the absurd statement by Kasich's chief strategist that: ""Rubio's presence in the race is keeping Republicans from consolidating around Governor Kasich""? 
Other party bosses have started to raise money for an anti-Trump PAC; some are preparing for a brokered convention. Given that so many delegates are distributed proportionately, this is not a bad Plan B. 
Although it's hard to imagine that Rubio would be the main beneficiary, given that he did so badly in the primaries. Why crown a loser?
Most depressing, however, are the plans by congressional Republicans simply to break with Trump in the event of a general election. They've done the math. They've seen the polls that put Trump way behind Hillary Clinton and they know he could cost them dearly. Better, they think, to cauterize the nomination -- let Trump have the presidential ticket, cut him off and stop the poison contaminating them.
But the bigger, existential problem they face is that Trump's rise has told them things about their voters that they weren't ready to hear and don't know how to respond to. It is surely significant that so many have voted for a candidate who is willing to soften his words on Planned Parenthood, who thinks that the Iraq War was a huge mistake or who won't reform entitlements. 
On policy, Trumpism is often more moderate than orthodox conservatism. In tone, however, it is considerably cruder. This is old-fashioned populism: an economic platform that is intended to help Middle America, even if its economic illiteracy ends up hurting the entire country.
In 2016, conservatives might have to surrender to Trump and/or find some way of distancing themselves from him. But in the long run, they have to acknowledge the issues he has raised and build some kind of constructive partnership with his voters. 
Republicans and a few crossover Democrats are defecting to Donald Trump. He is huge, and he isn't going away.

Trump: People say I 'have the most beautiful hands',http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/donald-trump-marco-rubio-beautiful-hands/index.html,cnn,3/1/2016 19:25:22,,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Tuesday brushed aside demeaning comments from Marco Rubio about the size of his hands, saying others disagree with the Florida senator.
""He said I have small hands -- I'm actually 6'3"", not 6'2"" -- but I've always heard people say, 'Donald, you have the most beautiful hands,' "" Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Super Tuesday.
Trump was responding to an unusual attack from Rubio over the weekend. 
""He's always calling me Little Marco. And I'll admit he's taller than me. He's like 6'2"", which is why I don't understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5'2"","" Rubio said at a rally in Virginia Sunday night. ""And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can't trust them.""
It was just one of a series of personal attacks that Rubio has made in the last few days about Trump.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has endorsed Trump, also took a jab at Rubio at an Ohio rally on Tuesday. 
""Sen. Rubio is on the air of desperate,"" said Christie, who dropped out of the presidential race after the New Hampshire primary.

"Voter turnout shows Trump, not Sanders, leading a revolution",http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/election-2016-turnout-records/index.html,cnn,3/2/2016 17:49:35,,"Bernie Sanders talks extensively about revolution, but it appears that it's actually Donald Trump who is driving record numbers of voters to the polls with his fiery populist message. 
Republicans voted in unprecedented numbers on Super Tuesday, setting record numbers in contests throughout different regions of the country.
Every state holding a Republican contest Tuesday -- with the exception of Vermont -- reached a new high for participation. But none of the state's holding Democratic contests broke any records.
Texas, home to a battle royale between Trump and native son Ted Cruz, saw a whopping 2.7 million voters show up for the Republican contest -- 1.2 million more than the previous record in 2012. 
In Virginia, 1,013,000 voters -- almost 350,000 more voters showed up than the previous record-setting year, 2008. And in Georgia, 1,273,000 voted Tuesday -- more than 300,000 above the record set in 2008.
That continue a trend this cycle of record-breaking Republican contests, beginning with Iowa and continuing in South Carolina, where Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore praised the 730,000 people who showed up a little more than a week ago, well more than the 603,000 South Carolinians who voted in the 2012 Republican primary.
All of which helps explain why Trump was crowing about a ""movement"" in his victory speech Tuesday night. As Chris Christie stood by his side, Trump referenced part of the New Jersey governor's reasoning for joining his campaign.
""When Chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign, he called me, he said 'Donald, what you've got is a movement,' "" Trump said Tuesday. ""He said, 'This is a movement; this is something like I've never seen.' And in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing. They've never seen what's happening right now. They've never seen anything like it. And I'm just honored by it.""
Sanders, who has been drawing large crowds throughout his presidential candidacy, has long spoken of leading his own political revolution.
On Tuesday night, speaking in his home state of Vermont after picking up a victory there and in three other contests, Sanders noted his revolution is about ""bringing millions of millions"" of new voters to the polls.
""What that revolution is about is bringing millions of millions of people into the political process. Working people who have been so disillusioned, they no longer vote. Young people who have never been involved,"" Sanders said Tuesday evening in his victory speech in Vermont. 
However, the numbers show he's coming up short of aspirations. States hosting Democratic contests Tuesday night did not set any records. Many did not see as large of turnouts as they saw in 2008, and some saw larger turnouts in the 1980s and 1990s, according to preliminary totals.
Republican officials, on the other hand, were astonished by the Trump effect. 
""It is just phenomenal. We are roughly 50% higher than our next highest turnout in our history for an election like this,"" Alaska Republican Party Chairman Peter Goldberg told XXX's Paul Vercammen, regarding the 21,930 who caucused there Tuesday.
""After disappointing Super Tuesday, Kasich turns focus to Midwestern states",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/9BKJqXiKRow/after-disappointing-super-tuesday-kasich-turns-focus-to-midwestern-states.html,fox,3/1/2016 23:04:00,,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich maintained that the Republican presidential race was moving to his ""home court"" after a series of largely disappointing results in the Super Tuesday contests. 
Kasich had followed up a second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary with back-to-back fifth-place finishes in the South Carolina primary and the Nevada caucuses. On Tuesday, strong performances in Vermont and Massachusetts were canceled out by distant finshes in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Oklahoma. 
In a speech to supporters in Mississippi, Kasich used a college basketball analogy to discuss his plan for the upcoming races. 
""We're almost to March Madness,"" Kasich said, ""and you know what they all struggle for, home court advantage.
""We're heading north right on to my home court with Michigan, and then, I’ll tell you now, we will beat Donald Trump in the state of Ohio.""
Michigan holds its primary March 8, with Ohio voting March 15. A total of 125 delegates are at stake in the two Rust Belt states. However, at least one recent poll has shown Kasich trailing Trump among Republican voters in the Buckeye State, while most Michigan polls show Trump in the lead by double digits.
Even if Kasich does pull off the double victory, it's unclear how he would capture enough delegates to catch Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, both of whom were the only Republican candidates to win on Tuesday."
Bernie Sanders campaign raises $42M in February,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/ONp9mL7oguQ/bernie-sanders-campaign-raises-42m-in-february.html,fox,3/1/2016 7:58:00,,"Ahead of a possible make-or-break Super Tuesday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign announced that it had raised more than $42 million in February.
Sanders' campaign claimed the total was the most raised in a single month by any of the 2016 candidates, adding that the self-described democratic socialist had received more than $6 million in donations on the final day of the month. 
“Not only are we going to smash Secretary [Hillary] Clinton’s personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in a statement.
Sanders' campaign has made much of its reliance on small donations, and the candidate himself has contrasted his comparatively shoestring fundraising operation with the far wealthier Clinton campaign. 
Since thumping Clinton by 20 points in the New Hampshire primary, Sanders has seen his fortunes fade. He suffered a narrow loss in the Nevada caucuses and a blowout defeat in Saturday's South Carolina primary.
Even Sanders' wife, Jane, admitted Monday that her husband's campaign faces a ""rough map"", with most of Tuesday's nominating contests taking place in states expected to favor Clinton. However, Sanders has vowed to carry on his run through this summer's Democratic convention."

The retired neurosurgeon did not officially suspend his campaign, saying he’ll discuss the “future of this movement” during a speech Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
But he made clear he’s stepping to the side as the four other Republican candidates continue to wage a battle for the GOP nomination.  
 “I have decided not to attend the Fox News GOP Presidential Debate tomorrow night in Detroit,” he said in a statement Thursday. “Even though I will not be in my hometown of Detroit on Thursday, I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America. I do not see a political path forward in light of last evening’s Super Tuesday primary results. 
“However, this grassroots movement on behalf of ‘We the People’ will continue. Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President, I remain committed to Saving America for Future Generations.”
Carson was the consummate outsider candidate – a non-politician who forged an illustrious career in medicine, far removed from the Washington world of lobbyists and lawyers. Known for his affable, soft-spoken, and sometimes-awkward speaking style, he was an unpredictable presence on the debate stage and at rallies.
He enjoyed a surge in the polls last year, at one point becoming competitive with Donald Trump. But he has not won a single contest, and was solidly in last place in the delegate count following Super Tuesday. "

XXX projects that Donald Trump will win three more states in the Super Tuesday contests, while Hillary Clinton will win two more.
Trump is projected to win the Tennessee, Alabama and Massachusetts primaries on the Republican side. The race in Oklahoma, meanwhile, is too close to call but Sen. Ted Cruz enjoys a slight lead there.
On the Democratic side, Clinton is projected to win Alabama and Tennessee by a wide margin.
The race in Oklahoma and Massachusetts is too close to call, though Bernie Sanders has a slight lead over Clinton in both states. 
The four states are the latest where polls have closed while Super Tuesday voting continues elsewhere. 
ORIGINAL STORY ... 
XXX projects Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will easily win the delegate-rich Georgia primaries – while Bernie Sanders, as expected, is projected to win his home state of Vermont. 
Clinton is also projected to win Virginia in the Democratic Super Tuesday race. The GOP side is too close to call, with Trump and Marco Rubio battling for first place, comfortably ahead of Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson.
Polls have closed in those three states, while Super Tuesday voting is under way elsewhere. 
But the biggest electoral prize of this hour is Georgia. On the GOP side, Rubio and Cruz are battling for second place, while Trump is projected to win by a comfortable margin. 
It’s also too early to call the Republican race in Vermont, where Kasich, who campaigned heavily there, is surprisingly competitive with Trump. 
Collectively, the Super Tuesday contests mark the biggest day of primary season voting to date. 
Early Republican race exit polls are reflecting deep voter discontent across the country, with many saying they’re looking to an outsider to be the next president – though some are still uncomfortable with the idea of an outsider like Trump claiming the Republican nomination.
Meanwhile, late-deciders in several states appeared to be breaking for Rubio, including in Virginia and Oklahoma. But Cruz was getting the lion’s share of support from voters looking for someone “very conservative.”
With polls starting to close, primary front-runners Clinton and Trump are aiming to rack up a daunting delegate lead and pull far away from their rivals in the nomination race.
The stakes are high.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates are up for grabs – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination.
And on the Democratic side, Clinton and Vermont Sen. Sanders are battling for 865 delegates in 11 states – roughly a third of the number needed to clinch the nomination.
Clinton entered Super Tuesday with a head of steam following her landslide win over Sanders in South Carolina this past Saturday. She hopes her “firewall” of black voters holds up in several delegate-rich Southern states Tuesday, as she moves to sideline the still-popular Sanders from the race. 
Sanders, though, savored his home-state win all the same, rallying cheering supporterse in Vermont Tuesday evening. 
""It is good to be home,"" he said, before shifting to his stump speech slams against a ""corrupt campaign finance system."" 
Barring a seismic shift in voter sentiment, Trump also is expected to dominate the Republican primary field Tuesday, adding to his already-sizable delegate lead – but Rubio and Cruz are battling fiercely for second, hoping to be the definitive alternative to take on Trump in what could be a bruising, to-the-convention fight for the future of the party.
Ohio Gov. Kasich, who's expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
“Super Tuesday was never anything that we ever thought was going to be some great thing for us,” Kasich openly acknowledged to XXX earlier Tuesday.
Cruz is the odds-on favorite in his home state of Texas – which, with 155 delegates, is the biggest prize of the night. In a sign of his expectations, Cruz planned his election night party in Stafford, Texas.
But because delegates can be allocated proportionally in the Super Tuesday contests, Rubio and Cruz both want to rack up a substantial number of second-place finishes.
A Rubio campaign aide told XXX they are ""focused on only one thing today: delegates.""
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, but the senator vowed to go to all 50 states in a bid to thwart his presidential run.
In the run-up to Tuesday, Cruz and Rubio both have stepped up their attacks on the front-runner, resorting to the kinds of personal insults and attacks that have defined Trump’s campaign style.
Rubio defended the new tack in an interview with XXX.
“Every now and then, someone like that needs a taste of their own medicine because that's called a bully and he’s using the pulpit of the presidency or the presidential run to insult people,” Rubio said.
Cruz told XXX that while Trump will have a “big chunk of delegates” come Wednesday morning, “We're going to have a big chunk of delegates, and there's going to be a huge drop off for everybody else.”
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, has defended his continued presence in the race.
“People have asked for somebody who is not a politician, who was a member of we the people, who has an outstanding life of achievement and who thinks the way they do,” he told XXX."

Bernie Sanders.
XXX projected Sanders winning his home state of Vermont and Oklahoma.
XXX exit polls show Clinton winning primaries in the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states of Georgia, Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, Massachusetts and Tennessee. She made her acceptance speech in Florida, ahead of the key March 15 primary there.
Sanders' path to the Democratic nomination, which gained momentum in previous weeks, fell flat Tuesday. Mathematically, he can still make his party’s nomination but it will be an uphill climb.
Sanders told supporters in Vermont he’s up for the challenge and vowed to keep fighting until the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July.
“This campaign is not just about electing a president. It is about transforming America,” Sanders said Tuesday night at a rally in Essex Junction, Vt. “It is about making our great country a nation it has the potential to be.”
Sanders added that the election is about “dealing with some unpleasant truths” and “having the guts to confront those truths.”
In a verbal jab at Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Clinton told a cheering crowd of supporters that the goal was not to “make American great again” but to “make America whole again.”
Going into Super Tuesday, Clinton ran 30 points ahead of Sanders in Georgia, and 20 points ahead in Virginia.
Democrats in 11 states weighed in on whom they want on the November ballot. Clinton aimed for a clean sweep of six states, while Sanders set his sights on five states, including two with caucuses.
Tuesday was the busiest day on the primary calendar so far. For Democrats, 859 delegates will be up for grabs – more than a third of the 2,383 needed to clinch the nomination.
Sanders started the day by casting a ballot for himself in Vermont and said he felt “great” about his prospects.
“After a lot of deliberation, I know that Bernie Sanders here in Vermont got at least one vote,” Sanders joked to reporters with his wife Jane by his side. “I was working on my wife. So I probably got two. So we are feeling pretty good.”
Clinton spent her morning talking to local residents at a Minneapolis coffee shop and local market. She was expected to spend the evening in Miami.
Clinton’s victory over Sanders in the southern states hinged on turning out the states’ large black population. About 4 in 10 voters in Georgia's Democratic primary were black, and about 8 in 10 of them favored Clinton. That mirrors her strong showing among black voters in South Carolina over the weekend."

At the top of that list, in both primary contests, is Texas. The Lone Star State has the biggest cache -- 222 Democratic delegates and 155 for Republicans.  
And perhaps no candidate is fighting harder for that prize than Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The senator went all out on Monday, holding rallies in voter-rich Dallas, Houston and San Antonio in hopes of at least defeating national front-runner Donald Trump in Cruz's home state. 
“We are going to have a very good Super Tuesday,” Cruz assured the Dallas crowd. Cruz has maintained a polling lead in the state, but knows a surprise loss there could doom his campaign.  
For Republicans, the second-biggest prize is Georgia, with 76 delegates at stake. Both Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio put in face time with voters Monday in the final hours before polls open, while Cruz stayed rooted in Texas.  
On the Democratic side, too, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have focused their efforts. 
While Clinton declared Saturday night after her decisive win in the South Carolina primary that the campaign was going “national,” the former secretary of state was concentrating Monday on two delegate-heavy states -- the Democratic-stronghold of Massachusetts (91 delegates) and Virginia (95 delegates).
Solid wins there and beyond on Super Tuesday could give her a nearly insurmountable delegate count toward the nomination. 
Clinton to date leads Sanders in the delegate count 543-to-85, including so-called superdelegates. They will compete for 865 delegates on Tuesday and a total of roughly 1,800 delegates over the next two weeks, with 2,382 needed to win the nomination. 
The delegates on the line in a dozen states Tuesday represent a third of those needed to clinch the party nod. 
And on the GOP side, 595 delegates are on the line Tuesday across 11 states -- nearly half the number needed to secure the nomination. 
Sanders is focusing on Minnesota and Colorado, progressive states where he hopes his message of social and economic equality will translate into votes.
“Americans don’t need crumbs, they need the whole loaf,” Sanders said at a rally in Minneapolis.
He is expected on Tuesday to win his home state of Vermont, which has 16 Democratic delegates. Minnesota is worth far more, with 77 delegates. 
Still, many of these contests divide delegates proportionally, and so Sanders is poised to walk away with some, even where he loses. His strategy appears to be to at least survive Tuesday, with hopes of a resurgence later this month in Maine and Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio.
On the Republican side, Trump has won three straight -- the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, and the Nevada Republican Caucus -- garnering 82 delegates.
Cruz kicked off the 2016 balloting by winning the Iowa Republican Caucus. He has 17 delegates, ahead of Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio with 16.
Though trailing in Texas, Trump holds big leads in other delegate-rich Super Tuesday states.
The billionaire businessman leads by double-digits in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia, according to RealClearPolitics poll averages. Rough 53 percent of the GOP’s 595 delegates on Tuesday are in those states.
Those polls were released before Trump over the weekend initially declined to disavow the backing of former KKK leader David Duke, which Rubio says makes him “unelectable.” 
Trump has since disavowed the support and blamed a supposedly faulty earpiece for his original handling of the question. 
The tough race is taking a toll on the candidates. Rubio, barnstorming the South to take hold of the GOP establishment mantle, temporarily lost his voice at a rally outside of Atlanta and needed South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has endorsed him, to take the microphone.
The two other GOP candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have six and four delegates, respectively."

Ted Cruz jointly turned up the pressure on Marco Rubio to drop out -- though the Florida senator insists he remains a contender and is ""optimistic"" about turning the race around once his home state votes.
Trump won seven states in Tuesday’s contests, bringing his delegate count to 316. Cruz, who won three states, now has 226 delegates. Rubio, with one state win and some second- and third-place finishes, brings his tally to 106. 
For Rubio, he's eyeing the March 15 primary in his home state of Florida as the game-changer. 
But at least until then, Trump and Cruz are working to sideline him. 
At his rally in Texas, Cruz urged voters to unite behind his campaign, warning that Trump is on a glide path to the nomination until that happens.
""So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation,"" he said. ""And, after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
He strongly suggested to reporters that Rubio should reconsider his presence in the race. 
Trump, who has openly mocked Rubio for everything from excessive sweating to drinking water on camera, vowed to beat the senator in his home state. 
With 10 furled American flags and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie standing behind him, Trump poked fun at Rubio, referring to him as “the little senator” and “a lightweight.” 
""It was a very tough night for Marco Rubio,"" Trump said. 
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, while stopping just short of repeating the call at his press conference. But he said, ""You've got to be able to win something.""
Shortly afterward, Rubio did notch his first victory in Minnesota. But he stresses that what matters is the delegates, and he's still adding to his tally.  
Rubio, who has repeatedly called Trump a “con artist” and slammed Cruz for not performing better on Super Tuesday, told XXX he’s not going anywhere.  
“Sixty-five percent of the people who voted yesterday across Super Tuesday did not vote for Donald Trump,” Rubio said. “He underperformed in virtually every state of the map.”
Rubio also had sharp words for Cruz.
“Let’s not forget that last night was supposed to be Ted Cruz’s big night. It was the night where he was going to sweep. The states were tailor made for the kind of campaign he was running. We beat him in Georgia. We beat him in half the states on the map.”
Rubio said the delegate counts will level out in upcoming winner-take-all primaries.  Rubio said he expects to win all of Florida’s 99 delegates up for grabs in the March 15 primary.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates were up for grabs Tuesday – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the GOP race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, has defended his continued presence in the race.
“People have asked for somebody who is not a politician, who was a member of we the people, who has an outstanding life of achievement and who thinks the way they do,” he told XXX."

Tech giants Google and Twitter have teamed with the Associated Press to launch AP Election Buzz, a tool for tracking online activity during the election.
Powered by Google Trends and Twitter, the tool’s charts show Google search interest in political terms, and election-related conversation on Twitter. The Google political index measures search interest in a list of 2016 election topics, such as presidential candidates, policy issues and current events. Twitter election conversation analyzes tweets containing data such as candidate names, campaign hashtags and other election-related terms. Both charts use Iowa caucus day on Feb.1 as a baseline.

""Spikes typically coincide with political events, such as debates, primaries and caucuses, though they may occur at different times on Google and Twitter, in part because the measurements differ,"" explained AP. “The Twitter numbers measure what people are saying online, while Google search data reflect what people want to find or learn about.”
Citing Google Trends data, the tool reports that Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump accounted for 59.3 percent of search interest in the past 24 hours, ahead of his Democratic counterparts Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton with 13.3 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively. Trump was also the main driver of conversation on Twitter, accounting for 58.4 percent of conversation, compared to Sanders’ 14.2 percent and Clinton’s 12.8 percent.
The most mentioned issues on Twitter in the past 24 hours are energy and the environment, national security and foreign affairs, which took 19.5 percent, 16.9 percent and 13.7 percent of conversation, respectively."
GOP nomination fight rumbles forward,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/pGCX-p1GQlU/gop-nomination-fight-rumbles-forward.html,fox,3/2/2016 14:57:00,,"GOP NOMINATION FIGHT RUMBLES FORWARD The Republican Party is getting ready to do something it has never done before.  The GOP is either going to nominate a candidate that has run his entire campaign against the party itself or it will unite around the goal of denying that candidate a win.  Donald Trump’s Super Tuesday performance was good – certainly good enough that if he was a conventional candidate, he would already be the presumptive nominee. But it wasn’t the knockout that he and his supporters had hoped for.  Trump racked up big wins in his strongholds but lost four of 11 contests. More significant than the win/loss record for the night is the delegate count. And in that measure, little changed.  After Tuesday’s contests, Trump is forecast to gain only about 20 delegates in his lead over Sen. Ted Cruz. Even with more than a quarter of the 2,340 delegates already allocated, a 20-delegate bump isn’t much. But, again, if Trump was an ordinary frontrunner, it would still be enough to break down resistance among the holdouts.  But Trump is not ordinary. Rather than acceptance, the despair among conservative and establishment Republicans is deepening; conservatives for fear of the dissolution of their movement, establishmentarians for fear of polls that show a general election wipeout that crushes the party all the way down the ballot.  Trump’s general election strategy is a comfort to his supporters and to some anxious Republicans. His argument that his mix of showmanship and left-right hodgepodge of positions can win enough blue-collar Democrats to pull off a victory goes against consistent head-to-head polling that shows him at a substantial deficit to presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  For most Republicans, however, this morning brought uncertainty and anxiety. The two choices facing the GOP seem unthinkable for a party that has long prided itself on orderly nominations. No nominee has gone to the Republican convention without enough delegates to win outright in 40 years, and there hasn’t been a floor fight at a convention in 68 years.  But the choices couldn't be clearer today. Option one: a quick capitulation to Trump’s takeover bid. Option two: push forward into an intentionally messy delegate fight and likely a contested convention.  The uncomprehending look on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s face as he stood behind Trump during the front runner’s election-night speech said it all for a party that has been forced to confront realities heretofore unimaginable.  When he backed Trump, Christie no doubt imagined himself the vanguard of an establishment that would make the best of an unusual nominee and get busy trying to save the general election.  That may yet happen, and Christie may look like a guy who bought Apple stock at $22 a share in 1980 instead of how he looked Tuesday: like a guy who accidentally walked in on a cockfight. But he will at least have to wait a while longer for his revenge.  Conventional wisdom says that Republicans will fall in line and accept the reality of having a populist renegade as their party’s standard bearer. With all people, the path of least resistance is usually the safest bet. In politics, it is doubly so.  But the establishment and conservatives will act out of mutual self-interest for the next two weeks and do as their respective champions, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, did in their remarks Tuesday night and focus their fire on Trump.  Every year, trailing candidates and hyperventilating pundits talk breathlessly about open conventions and floor fights. And for 40 years they have been wrong. But this time, it’s fully in the realm of possibility.  The best news for Trump out of Tuesday is that it seems far less likely that he will face a single opponent with unified support before the contests switch to winner-take-all on March 15.  Cruz had a very good night; more than good enough to erase his troubles of the previous two weeks. The problem for Cruz is that Tuesday was the best day on the primary calendar for him. Southern Republicans intentionally frontloaded their contests in a bid to give a favorite son a boost in the early going. It worked. But now Cruz faces many tough contests in more moderate states outside the South.  Marco Rubio had a long night. He notched his first victory but fell short in Virginia and now trails Cruz substantially in the delegate count. For Rubio, however, the road looks smoother from here. While he faces a make-or-break test two weeks from now in Florida, Rubio can at least say that his hardest day on the calendar is behind him.  That’s all good news for Donald Trump in the sense that neither Cruz nor Rubio came out of the night as the consensus favorite for the rest of the party.  But the bad news for Trump is that the emphasis for the party has shifted away from picking a nominee and toward blocking a nominee. The next two weeks will see an all-out assault on Trump with the aim of letting voters check their assumptions one more time and perhaps denying Trump the delegates he needs to win outright.  It’s going to get weird out there, America. "
Gretchen's Take: Shorter calendar strategy is helping Trump,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/y0DtjtCS9Ms/gretchens-take-shorter-calendar-strategy-is-helping-trump.html,fox,3/2/2016 14:43:00,,"There's no doubt Donald Trump came out the big winner on the GOP side last night for Super Tuesday -- and all of that is certainly not sitting well with the Republican establishment. However, it reminds me of the phrase, “be careful what you wish for”. hoping to avoid a repeat of the messy fight for the republican nomination in 2012, the party drew up a calendar intended to allow a front-runner to wrap things up quickly. 
The GOP primary season started a month later this year, Iowa was February 1st instead of January 3rd in 2012.
The process will also end a month earlier with the 2016 GOP convention set for July 18th, instead of the last week in August.
In 2014 the Republican National Committee, also known as, the RNC, decided to compress the primary calendar too moving up the winner-take-all states to March 15th.
Certainly the shorter calendar strategy was set up to favor the establishment candidate. Never did anyone envision the candidate most helped in amassing a lot of delegates quickly would be named Donald Trump.  "
Hillary’s on a roll but she’s still unloved and untrusted. And that’s a big problem,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/pbY3tQeDEeM/hillary-s-on-roll-but-s-still-unloved-and-untrusted-and-that-s-big-problem.html,fox,3/2/2016 19:05:00,,"Hillary Clinton had a Super Tuesday, winning seven of eleven states. In her victory speech, she promised to “Make America Whole,” slamming Donald Trump for dividing the country.
The New York Times was practically giddy with relief that Clinton had triumphed, thus kneecapping the quixotic but popular Bernie Sanders.
The Times was equally joyous to report a “deep chasm” dividing the GOP, claiming the Republican Party was “falling apart.”
Nowhere did the Times mention the most stunning aspect of the primary season to date. Far from falling apart, GOP participation is growing like topsy, while the number of people turning out to vote Democratic has cratered.
In Texas, about 2.8 million Republicans turned out, about twice the number in 2012. That’s in sharp contrast to the Democrats, where 1.4 million votes were cast, about half the number in 2008.
In Massachusetts, nearly 20,000 voters quit the Democratic Party in order to sign up for the GOP.  In the four first states to vote, the number of participants on the GOP side was ahead by 26 percent, while Democratic turnout was down across the board.
The GOP may be falling apart, but it’s doing so in a growing tent. Ironically, Donald Trump, who has been scorned for dividing the country, appears to be bringing together a disparate group of Americans tired of liberal policies and fed up with government incompetence. They’ve waited for Democrats to fix what’s broken – for nearly 8 years – and now they’re ready to try something new.
And, they don’t like Hillary Clinton. Clinton may be able to beat a 74-year-old Socialist, but running against Donald Trump will be tough. Word is that her camp thinks facing off against Trump will be a walk in the park. Her husband, who has keen political instincts, knows better.
One warning shot comes from a recent CNN/ORC International poll. Though the survey suggests that Hillary is her party’s preferred candidate – by a margin of 55 percent to 38 percent over Bernie Sanders – it also reveals an “enthusiasm gap” wide enough to drive a houseboat through. This is her challenge.
When asked the question “Compared to previous elections, are you more enthusiastic about voting than usual, or less enthusiastic?” Forty-six percent of registered Democrats said “more enthusiastic” while 42 percent said they were less pumped up. In November 2007, by comparison, 68 percent of Democrats, ecstatic about the possibility of dumping George W. Bush and about Barack Obama’s candidacy, answered that they were more enthusiastic, while only 24 percent said they were less so. The readings are the worst since 2000.
Drilling down, women are overall less excited about this election, as are minorities. The folks most enthusiastic about voting are males and older Americans. Hillary needs young people, minorities and women to rally to her cause -- the old Obama coalition -- if she is to beat the Republican nominee. 
Asking the same question of Republicans, 58 percent say they are more enthusiastic about voting than usual, while only 30 percent responded that they were less excited. Welcome to the Donald Trump effect. Or maybe to the “Seven Years of Obama is Enough” phenomenon.
In this poll, conducted at the end of February, 49 percent of Republicans and right-leaning independents indicate they are behind Trump, the highest level in the past six months. Only 16 percent line up behind Rubio, and 15 percent are for Cruz. This shatters the thought that there were at most 30 to 35 percent of Republicans willing to back the billionaire.  It also shatters the previous record of 41 percent set in late January. Trump’s support has gained steadily since mid-September.
However, it’s not all good news for Trump backers. In another question, respondents are asked if they would support a particular candidate, should he be nominated. While 69 percent say they would “definitely” or “probably” support Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio, only 52 percent say they would line up behind Trump. Worse - only 11 percent say they would definitely not support Cruz and 12 percent won’t back Rubio; a full 35 percent say they will definitely not vote for Trump. Trump will have to mend some fences.
By contrast, if Hillary Clinton is the nominee, 65 percent of Democrats and left-leaning independents surveyed say they will definitely or probably support her; only 20 percent say they absolutely will not.
Though Trump walks away with the overall GOP vote, it looks like backers take a more jaundiced view of the tycoon’s capabilities, while still placing him above his rivals. A slim majority (51 percent) of Republicans thinks Trump would be the most effective at solving the country’s problems; Cruz comes in second in the problem-solving department with 17 percent of the poll. As for handling the duties of commander-in-chief, Trump again leads, but with the confidence of less than half of right-leaning voters.
In assessing who’s most honest and trustworthy, Trump only gets 35 percent of the votes, compared to 22 percent for Carson, 14 percent for Cruz and 13 percent for Rubio. After all the charges and counter-charges that the candidates have flung at each other in recent weeks, a lack of credibility is understandable.
Hillary Clinton flunks the character issue by a huge margin: only 36 percent think she is the most honest and trustworthy candidate, compared to 59 percent that credits Sanders with those characteristics.
This is only one poll, but it’s a revealing snapshot. As the campaigns plow onward, positions may change. However, Hillary’s problems with how voters view her honesty and trustworthiness appear durable.
The same may be true of The Donald.
If the country is presented with two flawed candidates, the “enthusiasm gap” could prove decisive."
Hillary vs. Bernie: It’s time to do the math in a post-Super Tuesday world,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/otkFAiG-3Ic/hillary-vs-bernie-it-s-time-to-do-math-in-post-super-tuesday-world.html,fox,3/2/2016 3:00:00,,"Saturday night’s results in South Carolina were the start of something special for Hillary Clinton.
After a close to 50-point victory there where she garnered the support of over 80 percent of African-American voters, Clinton showed that her tough time in Iowa – where she won by less than half a percentage point – and New Hampshire where Sanders won by over 20 points, are a vague and distant memory.
How distant that memory is was clear Tuesday evening where Clinton won Super Tuesday handedly.  
Sanders had been running ahead in his home state of Vermont throughout the last two months and his big win there is no surprise. He also won Oklahoma and Colorado. He had also been hoping to make a play for Massachusetts.
So what does this mean for the future of the Democratic race?
Not a whole lot in terms of what you’re going to see in the day to day.
Bernie Sanders has made it clear that he will keep going until the convention this summer. He certainly has the money to make good on this promise – Sanders raised an astounding $43 million in February alone – and I have no doubt that he’ll continue raising funds at this level. Like Trump, Sanders has been successfully tapping into voter dissatisfaction and his populist message of addressing income inequality and reining in Wall Street has been deeply resonating with voters.
This isn’t apt to change and the media will continue to report that the momentum is on Sanders’s side as he draws huge crowds and raises millions.
It’s extremely unlikely that Clinton will start winning the youth vote back from him and she will instead focus on keeping the female vote and maintaining her support with the African- American community.
By the looks of it, and the turnout patterns we’ve seen thus far, this is going to be enough for Clinton to continue to on her path to the nomination. And much of this really comes down to the math.
To this end, when Sanders declared Tuesday evening that the contest has only begun because we still have 35 states left to vote, he’s not telling the whole story.
Clinton is amassing a big delegate lead and we know that she’s already far ahead with the Democrat superdelegates where she has the support of over 60 percent of them.
Sanders’s team knows what a tremendous advantage this is for Clinton as they’ve been reportedly trying to persuade superdelegates to reserve judgment until the popular vote totals are in. (This hasn’t been a particularly effective approach thus far).
It follows that, although it isn’t the glitziest way to win an election, Clinton is making it mathematically impossible for Sanders to win the nomination.
The #FeelTheBern movement was a powerful one, but it doesn’t look like it can go all the way."
MEDIA BUZZ Trump has used a general election strategy all along,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/02/middle-ground-how-trump-plotted-general-election-strategy-from-start.html,fox,3/2/2016 10:32:44,,"Donald Trump, whose big Super Tuesday night brings him one step closer to the November ballot, has been running a general election campaign from the beginning.
Trump and his inner circle never advertised this, of course, and are amused by how the media have largely missed the strategy.
While Hillary Clinton, who also had a big day yesterday, had her aides leak details to the New York Times and Washington Post of how she’s planning a general-election assault on Trump, the Republican front-runner has had his eye on the fall since day one.
People familiar with his approach say some strategic elements evolved as the campaign unfolded. There was no 100-page memo plotting it out in advance. But this mindset explains why Trump has done certain things that are wildly unorthodox in a Republican primary race, much to the anger and consternation of leading conservative politicos and pundits.
One linchpin of this strategy came in Trump’s announcement speech, when he stirred controversy by saying that illegal Mexican immigrants included criminals and rapists. That, and his vow to build a wall across the border, gave him credibility with the conservative base. Whenever Trump would take a more moderate stance that might alienate that base, he could just pivot back to his tough immigration stance.
Trump declared early on that there should be no cuts to Social Security and Medicare. That, as his campaign knows full well, is not the standard Republican line. Conservatives believe deeply in shrinking the size of government and that entitlement programs must be reined in because they eat up a major chunk of the budget.
But Democrats have been accusing Republicans of wanting to gut the programs for a generation. Trump’s position—that people paid into the program and deserve to reap the benefits—plays well in a general election, especially since he hopes to peel off some working-class Democrats and independents.
In his press conference last night, Trump again sung the praises of Planned Parenthood, saying he would only defund the group’s abortion services—despite what the “so-called conservatives” think. This may be anathema to conservative Republicans who despise the group and are ardently pro-life. But his stance could appeal to suburban women who might otherwise view a Republican nominee as hostile.
Trump, at his rallies, routinely tries out different narratives and drops the ones that don’t work. But he has settled on a mix of conservative and moderate positions that partially explains why Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio keep attacking him as an inauthentic conservative.
Trump has never run as a doctrinaire right-winger. He has, after all, spoken repeatedly about raising taxes on hedge-fund executives, which is usually a Democratic talking point.
Trump certainly sounded like a general-election candidate last night, taking a more subdued tone and talking about sitting in the Oval Office and making deals with Democrats and Republicans. The press conference setting yielded a more subdued tone—he even said nice things about the press!—and got him 40 minutes of precious cable airtime.
The general-election strategy was also evident in Trump’s travel schedule. While some pundits questions why he wasn’t spending more time in Iowa or New Hampshire, he would jet off for rallies in Alabama and Mississippi or Massachusetts and Vermont. This was in part because he would need those states later in the primaries, but also to lay the groundwork for November.
Most Republican candidates move right during the primaries and then slide to the center a bit during the fall campaign, while Democrats do the opposite. If the Super Tuesday results indeed mean that Trump is close to becoming the party’s standard-bearer, he may not have to pivot as much as most nominees. "

MITT WEIGHS IN  Romney announces speech on state of 2016 race,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/02/romney-to-make-major-speech-on-2016-race.html,fox,3/2/2016 18:58:03,,"Mitt Romney will deliver a major speech on the state of the 2016 race for the White House Thursday, amid rising panic among some Republican leaders that Donald Trump may be cruising to the nomination. 
The 2012 Republican presidential nominee will speak at 11:30 a.m ET from the University of Utah. Exactly what Romney will say was not immediately clear, though there were no signs that Romney would either endorse a candidate or jump into the race himself.
Romney considered another White House run at the beginning of 2015 before deciding against the move, reportedly after being out-raised by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- who has since suspended his campaign.
Despite his decision not to run, there has been widespread media speculation that he could be tempted back into the race in the case of a contested Republican convention as a last gasp way to stop Trump.
The speech comes after Trump racked up a string of Super Tuesday wins, building a wide -- though not insurmountable -- delegate lead over closest rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
The former Massachusetts governor has become increasingly vocal in his opposition to the business mogul.
Last week, Romney told XXX’ Neil Cavuto that he believes there may be a “bombshell” in Trump’s tax returns, and called for Trump to release his returns as soon as possible.
He later criticized Trump for not immediately disavowing the support of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke.
Although Trump did later disavow Duke, Romney called his response “disqualifying and disgusting.”
A disqualifying & disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America.— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 29, 2016

That’s what Republican voters in 11 states will decide today as they head to the polls and caucuses to determine whether they are content with their frontrunner, Donald Trump, or ready to shake things up.  The only state of the 11deciding today in which Trump does not lead pre-election polls is Texas, where favorite son, Sen. Ted Cruz, seems to have the edge. But elsewhere, it looks like Trump by a mile. In some spots where blue-collar white voters dominate, like Alabama and Massachusetts, Trump’s lead in some polls crosses into the stratosphere.  Overall, however, the shape of the race in the Super Tuesday states looks more like what we saw in Iowa and South Carolina: Trump is ahead but Sens. Marco Rubio and Cruz are within hailing distance and splitting up half of the vote or so.  Let’s consider some scenarios:  Say goodnight - If Donald Trump has been helped rather than hurt by the sustained attacks on his business record and character by Cruz and Rubio, and if the Republican electorate has really accommodated itself to the idea of the celebrity billionaire as its standard bearer, it could all be over by midnight. Should Trump win all 11 contests or dominate 10 and come close in Texas, you can go ahead and call him the presumptive nominee.  A longer road - Past could be prologue for today’s contest, and that’s still good news for Trump overall. If the polls are predictive, which they have mostly been so far, then Trump’s advantage is in the limited success of his rivals. If Trump wins 40 percent of the nearly 600 delegates on the table, but Cruz and Rubio remain knotted behind him, then Trump would continue to march on to victory. It would take longer, but a split decision in the rest of the party would mean continued division and possibly even the continued candidacies of Gov. John Kasich and Ben Carson. This is the one in which we hear a lot of palaver about a brokered convention.  Reset button - It’s only as late in the game as Republican voters think it is. Trump triumphalism, greeted by cheers in some quarters and baleful tears in others, is a state of mind. While nearly a quarter of delegates are on the table today, 71 percent of all delegates will still be untouched on Wednesday morning. There are more delegates available in the two weeks after today, many in winner-take-all contests, than in every contest so far. If Republicans are getting cold feet about Trump and he is losing some of his luster, today could be the hinge on the gate that swings the election into a new phase. Rubio needs a moon shot to pull this off, but that could begin tonight.  [Watch Fox: The AEHQ team is at it again with Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier teaming up for another primary day special starting tonight at 6 p.m. ET through the night as the results come in.]  POWER PLAY: SUPER TUESDAY SUPER STATES There are a lot of states voting today and with so many possible scenarios who knows what could happen? Chris Stirewalt breaks down the key counties and states to watch today that could give you the inside scoop as the results are tallied tonight. WATCH HERE.  THE LAY OF THE LAND Here’s your state-by-state guide to the Super Tuesday votes with the key counties to watch. Have fun and stay tuned!  TEXAS There are two contests in Texas for the Republicans: One for pride and the other for delegates. Cruz hopes to win both, and will be counting on his neighbors in the Houston metro area to deliver it for him. But Trump should find plenty of good drilling in the vast countryside where lower-income voters dominate. Rubio will be looking to scoop up some delegates from suburban Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin. Even a respectable third-place finish in Texas could still net as many delegates as were awarded in Nevada last week.  --155 delegates     --108 delegates from the state’s 36 congressional districts, three per district (outright majority wins all three district delegates, plurality win gets two, with one for the runner-up)     --47 at-large delegates based on statewide results (outright majority win receives all at-large delegates, if two candidates receive 20 percent or more the delegates will be allocated proportionally, if no one receives 20 percent delegates are awarded proportionally) --Open primary --7,999,657 ballots cast in 2012     --Mitt Romney, 69 percent; Ron Paul, 12 percent; Rick Santorum, 8 percent; Newt Gingrich, 5 percent --Polls close at 8 p.m. ET
Harris County: Houston is Cruz Country Cruz’s electoral base is right in the densest concentration of Republican votes in the state of Texas. The simplest way for him to win is to just run up the score on his home turf.

[2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 69 percent; Ron Paul, 13 percent; Rick Santorum, 7 percent; Newt Gingrich, 5 percent]  Dallas County: A milder picante Like other large to midsize cities in Texas, the more affluent suburbs of Dallas County could prove fruitful for Rubio, even if he does not win the overall metropolitan area. Rubio could steal some votes here and maybe even carry a congressional district. That could help him get out Texas with his boots on.  --Population: 2,518,638 --Median household income: $49,481 --Unemployment: 5 percent --Race: Caucasian, 68 percent; black, 23 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 29 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 10 percent --2012 general election: 57 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 72 percent; Ron Paul, 10 percent; Rick Santorum, 8 percent; Newt Gingrich, 5 percent]  Randall County: Trump’s America The best news for Donald Trump in Texas is the sheer size of the Lone Star State. While Texas is dominated by four huge metropolitan areas, there are dozens of what would be considered small to medium size cities in ordinary states. Those places include cities like Amarillo with a population of about 200,000, most of which is in Randall County.  --Population: 128,220 --Median household income: $58,529 --Unemployment: 3 percent --Race: Caucasian, 93 percent; Hispanic, 20 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 30 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 14 percent --2012 general election: Romney 83 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 72 percent; Rick Santorum, 10 percent; Ron Paul, 8 percent; Newt Gingrich, 4 percent]  GEORGIA The Peach State is the biggest unknown today, not in the sense that its outcome is a mystery – Trump should win first place handily – but in how the rest of its vote will break out and how large Trump’s lead will be. Trump has consistently held between 30 and 40 percent of the vote in polls recently, but Rubio and Cruz have shown strength and durability behind him.  --76 delegates, bound     --42 are awarded from the state’s 14 congressional districts, three per district (outright majority wins all three district delegates, plurality win gets two, with one for the runner-up)     --34 at-large delegates based on statewide results (20 percent threshold) --Open primary --3,908,369 ballots cast in 2012     --Newt Gingrich, 47 percent; Mitt Romney, 26 percent; Rick Santorum, 20 percent; Ron Paul, 7 percent --Polls close at 7 p.m. ET (Note: polling places with a population of more than 300,000 will be open until 8 p.m. ET)  Fulton County: Trump’s test While the outer suburbs of Atlanta are happy Trump territory, close-in suburbs with affluent and better educated voters will be his proving ground. If Trump can win with Republicans and crossover Democrats in tony sections like Buckhead and other places inside the I-285 Beltway, he will be on his way to a romp. Conversely if Rubio shows that more moderate Republicans are rallying to his banner as they did for Mitt Romney four years ago, Georgia could be the start of the turnaround for the race.  --Population: 996,319 --Median household income: $58,857 --Unemployment: 9 percent --Race: Caucasian, 48 percent; black 44 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 48 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 10 percent --2012 general election: Obama 64 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 47 percent; Newt Gingrich, 32 percent; Rick Santorum, 12 percent; Ron Paul, 8 percent]  Bartow County: Appalachian spring The lesson learned about Trump’s support from the South Carolina Primary is that it is most intense in places where incomes are low and white voters live alongside large minority populations. But we also learned that support for Cruz and Rubio was stronger in Appalachia. And North Georgia has plenty of Appalachia. While Trump can be expected to dominate smaller communities in the south and east, places like Cartersville in Bartow County a third of the way to the Tennessee State Line from Atlanta, could be good for Cruz and Rubio.  --Population: 101,736 --Median household income: $47,197 --Unemployment: 8 percent --Race: Caucasian, 86 percent; black, 11 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 16 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 13 percent --2012 general election: Romney 75 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Newt Gingrich, 56 percent; Rick Santorum, 19 percent; Mitt Romney, 18 percent; Ron Paul, 6 percent]  VIRGINIA If Rubio is really a viable contender, Virginia is where he will show it. It is a blue-hued swing state with lots of upscale suburbanites, well-educated voters and moderate Republicans. But conversely, if he can’t do well here the idea of a Rubio stretch run will run out of gas.  --49 delegates     --All delegates awarded proportionally based on statewide results with no threshold --Open primary --3,854,489 ballots cast in 2012     ---Mitt Romney, 60 percent; Ron Paul, 40 percent --Polls close at 7 p.m. ET  Fairfax County: Club Fed One of the wealthiest counties in America, Fairfax County is home to people who feel the very best about the federal government. The so-called “Beltway Bandits” who have prospered with fine federal jobs or fat federal contracts live here. Though overwhelmingly Democratic since the 1990s, by sheer size, Fairfax is still home to lots of Republicans. Like the cluster of counties that surround it this should be good territory for Rubio, but he needs to be on the lookout for John Kasich. If Kasich’s spoiler campaign is going to hurt Rubio anywhere it will be among the centrist, government enthusiasts of NoVa.  --Population: 1,137,538 --Median household income: $110,292 --Unemployment: 4 percent --Race: Caucasian, 67 percent; Hispanic, 16 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 59 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 12 percent --2012 general election: Obama 60 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 65 percent; Ron Paul, 35 percent]  Albemarle County: Wahoobio? One of the reasons that Marco Rubio can be cautiously optimistic about his chances in Virginia is the sustained growth of Charlottesville and the University of Virginia. Previous elections saw only three centers of population in the state: The dense suburbs of Northern Virginia, Richmond and its environs, and the industrial Tidewater region. But Charlottesville offers a surprising number of votes and, if other affluent university towns so far this cycle are a guide, fecund ground for Rubio.
--Population: 104,489 --Median household income: $67,725 --Unemployment: 3 percent --Race: Caucasian, 83 percent; black 10 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 52 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 17 percent --2012 general election: Obama 55 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 62 percent; Ron Paul, 38 percent]  OKLAHOMA Why isn’t Trump doing better in Oklahoma polls? The state matches his demographic profile: white, ranked 42nd in adults with college degrees and 41st in median household income. But instead of the Trump smash being forecast in some other similar-seeming states, polls show Trump only 10 points or so ahead. There are a few possible explanations including the expansive, though recently arrested, success of the natural gas industry. But more likely it is this: Oklahoma may be the most politically conservative state in America. The Sooner State sent fiscal disciplinarian “Dr. No,” Tom Coburn (now boosting Rubio) to Congress for as long as he wanted.  --43 delegates     --15 congressional district delegates, three for each of the 5 districts (outright majority win receives all congressional delegates, top three finishers get one delegate each if they receive above 15 percent of the voter)     --28 at-large delegates based on statewide results (outright majority win receives all at-large delegates, if candidates receive 15 percent or above the delegates will be allocated proportionally) --Closed primary --1,334,872 ballots cast in 2012     --Rick Santorum, 34 percent; Mitt Romney, 28 percent; Newt Gingrich, 27 percent; Ron Paul, 10 percent --Polls close at 8 p.m. ET  Oklahoma County: Almost all the marbles Oklahoma City was a boomtown and is still a hub for the region. It’s fast growing southern suburbs, including Moore, ought to see a fairly close split between Rubio and Cruz.  --Population: 766,215 --Median household income: $45,215 --Unemployment: 3 percent --Race: Caucasian, 71 percent; black, 16 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 30 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 13 percent --2012 general election: Romney 58 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 34 percent; Rick Santorum, 31 percent; Newt Gingrich, 23 percent; Ron Paul, 11 percent]
ALABAMA TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMP!  --50 delegates --21 district delegates three delegates for each of the seven counties (outright majority or the only candidate with over 20 percent receives all congressional delegates, if more than one candidate receives 20 percent the candidate with the most votes gets two delegates and the runner up gets one delegate) --29 at-large delegates based on statewide results (outright majority or above a 20 percent win receives all at-large delegates, if no one reaches that mark delegates will be allocated proportionally to those finishing above 20 percent) --Open primary --2,074,338 ballots cast in 2012 --Rick Santorum, 35 percent; Newt Gingrich, 29 percent; Mitt Romney, 29 percent; Ron Paul, 5 percent --Polls close at 8 p.m. ET (Note: Some polling places in Alabama are in the Eastern Time zone and close at 7 p.m. ET while others in the Central Time zone close at 8 p.m. ET)  Mobile County: Coastal elite While there is a large blue-collar population on Alabama’s Gulf Coast it is also home to some of the state’s most affluent, upscale voters. The most votes can be found around Birmingham and Jackson, this demographically split portion of the state offers some interesting wrinkles. But it’s probably Trump, the whole Trump and nothing but the Trump.  --Population: 415,123 --Median household income: $43,028 --Unemployment: 7 percent --Race: Caucasian, 60 percent; black, 35 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 21 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 15 percent --2012 general election: Romney 54 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 36 percent; Rick Santorum, 34 percent; Newt Gingrich, 24 percent; Ron Paul, 5 percent]  ARKANSAS In the greatest film ever set in Arkansas, John Wayne’s “True Grit,” Marshal Rooster Cogburn tells the outlaw Ned Pepper that he means to kill him in “one minute,” or see him hanged in Fort Smith. Pepper, played by Robert Duval, looks at Cogburn’s paunch and declares, “I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man.” You can tell the same to anyone who pretends to know what will happen in the Arkansas Republican Primary.  --40 delegates --12 district delegates, three for each of the state’s four congressional districts (outright majority win receives all the district delegates, if no candidate receives a majority of the vote the candidate with the plurality receives two delegates and the runner up receives one) --28 at-large delegates based on statewide results (each candidate with 15 percent or more receives one delegate and the candidate with the majority receives the rest, if no candidate has a statewide majority the remaining delegates are awarded proportionally to those above 15 percent of the vote) --Closed primary --1,069,468 ballots cast in 2012 --Mitt Romney, 68 percent; Ron Paul, 13 percent; Rick Santorum, 13 percent; Newt Gingrich, 5 percent --Polls close at 8:30 p.m. CST  Pulaski County: Two stories There are two ways to look at Arkansas’ capital, Little Rock, and its county, Pulaski. On one hand, it looks like Trump country, where lots of blue-collar white voters live in close proximity to a significant number of minorities. But it’s also a capital city where there are plenty of upscale voters. There’s a decent chance that the three frontrunners will come out essentially even.  --Population: 392,701 --Median household income: $46,013 --Unemployment: 5 percent --Race: Caucasian, 59 percent; black 36 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 31 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 14 percent --2012 general election: Obama 55 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 71 percent; Ron Paul, 13 percent; Rick Santorum, 12 percent; Newt Gingrich, 4 percent]
Benton County: Company town Politicians in both parties have spent more than a decade pursuing the elusive “Walmart voter.” Well, here’s your chance. The corporate headquarters of America’s largest private employer is here in Bentonville and it is among the most prosperous places in a region not known for its prosperity. This county in the northwest corner of the state could be a hidden gem for Rubio.
--Population: 242,321 --Median household income: $54,515 --Unemployment: 4 percent --Race: Caucasian, 90 percent; black 2 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 29 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 13 percent --2012 general election: Romney 70 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 65 percent; Rick Santorum, 16 percent; Ron Paul, 15 percent; Newt Gingrich, 5 percent]  TENNESSEE You can divide Tennessee into three distinct regions: The Appalachian east, the Cumberland Valley around Nashville in the center, and the Memphis sprawl in the west. The eastern side of the state around Knoxville should be revealing about the relative strengths about Rubio and Cruz. Like the rest of the region, the population and economic center of metro Knoxville should be better for the two senators than elsewhere. The battle and most of the votes, however, will be to the west.  --58 delegates     --27 district delegates three from each of the nine congressional districts (candidate with either 67 percent majority in the district wins all three delegates, if no one reaches that mark candidates with the highest percent of the vote receive two delegates and the runner up gets one delegate so long as they have above 20 percent of the vote)     --31 at-large delegates based on statewide results (candidate with 67 percent of the vote receives all at-large delegates, otherwise delegates are distributed proportionally to those with 20 percent of the vote) --Open primary --2,460,904 ballots cast in 2012     --Rick Santorum, 37 percent; Mitt Romney, 28 percent; Newt Gingrich, 24 percent; Ron Paul, 9 percent --Most polls close at either 7 or 8 p.m. ET (Polls closings vary by county and are split between Eastern and Central time zones)  Williamson County: Moderate twang You probably think of Nashville as Music City. But if you live in Tennessee, you think of it as the state capital, and a large, growing, affluent city that is home to Vanderbilt University and multiple corporate headquarters. As the county stretches out to the south, however, it takes in more blue-collar voters on the other side of Franklin. Like the Northern Virginia suburbs, if Marco Rubio is a contender for 2016 he will do well in Williamson County.  --Population: 205,226 --Median household income: $89,779 --Unemployment: 4 percent --Race: Caucasian, 90 percent; black 5 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 53 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 12 percent --2012 general election:  Romney 73 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 36 percent; Rick Santorum, 32 percent; Newt Gingrich, 23 percent; Ron Paul, 8 percent]  Shelby County: Trump smokes ‘em There’s a lot to like about Memphis and its main suburban county, particularly the blues and barbeque. But if you are Donald Trump there’s even more. The county has some wealthy enclaves, but is dominated in Republican politics by his kind of voter.  --Population: 938,803 --Median household income: $46,250 --Unemployment: 6 percent  --Race: Caucasian, 42 percent; black, 53 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 29 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 12 percent --2012 general election: Obama 63 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Rick Santorum, 37 percent; Mitt Romney, 34 percent; Newt Gingrich, 19 percent; Ron Paul, 8 percent]  MASSACHUSETTS If you thought New Hampshire liked Donald Trump, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. With the same primary setup as New Hampshire that allows independents to vote, a lot of fed-up, blue-collar voters and no particular bent towards conservativism, Massachusetts is maximum Trump. He may get enough votes in Middlesex County alone to carry the state’s primary. Middlesex is the broad swap of urban sprawl on the north side of Boston, part of which was once represented by Trump endorser former Sen. Scott Brown.  --42 delegates     --27 district delegates three for each of the state’s nine congressional districts     --15 at-large delegates     --All delegates allocated proportionally based on statewide results with a five percent threshold --Mixed primary (Republicans and independents can vote in the GOP primary, but not Democrats) --3,167,767 ballots cast in 2012     --Mitt Romney, 93 percent; Unallocated, 7 percent --Polls close at 8 p.m. ET

And that makes things weird. Rick Santorum carried the state in 2012 as he was gamely chasing Romney, even though Minnesota didn’t demographically match Santorum’s other successful areas. The only poll taken this year showed Rubio slightly ahead of Cruz and Trump at the end of January. But who the heck knows? Organization is the key in these small-turnout affairs. Trump showed he could deliver in Nevada, so keep your eyes on the North Star State. Most of the vote will come from Hennepin County in the suburbs of Minneapolis.  --38 delegates     --Candidate with 85 percent or more receives all 38 delegates     --24 district delegates, three from each of the state’s eight districts, will be awarded proportionally to those with a mandatory 10 percent threshold within the district     --14 at-large delegates based on statewide results to those with a mandatory 10 percent threshold --Open caucus --2,936,561 ballots cast in 2012     --Rick Santorum, 45 percent; Ron Paul, 27 percent; Mitt Romney, 17 percent; Newt Gingrich, 11 percent --Polls close at 9 p.m. ET

After a few days on the trail with her candidate Trump, we haven’t heard much from the former Alaska governor. But presumably she should be able to deliver her home state for him. Trump and Palin, however, must beware of the wide streak of establishment Republicanism that runs through Alaska. Even so, the last frontier ought to come in late, but heavy for Trump. Keep your eyes on Mantanuska-Susitna Borough -- the heart of the “Mat-Su Valley” -- that’s where almost all the votes will be.  --28 delegates     --Delegates allocated proportionally with a mandatory 13 percent threshold statewide --Closed caucus --300,495 ballots cast in 2012     --Mitt Romney, 32 percent; Rick Santorum, 30 percent; Ron Paul, 24 percent; Newt Gingrich, 13 percent --Polls close 12 a.m. (March 2nd)  Mantanuska-Susitna Borough: --Population: 97,882 --Median household income: $71,037 --Unemployment: 8 percent --Race: Caucasian, 84 percent; black, 1 percent --Adults with bachelor’s degree: 21 percent --Residents age 65 or older: 10 percent --2012 general election: Romney 55 percent  [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 32 percent; Rick Santorum, 30 percent; Ron Paul, 24 percent; Newt Gingrich, 13 percent]  VERMONT We have talked many times this election cycle about the surprising number of voters torn between Trump and Vermont’s socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. While that split was helpful for Trump in neighboring New Hampshire and will be in Massachusetts today, it’s not likely to do much good for Trump in Sanders’ home state. The Green Mountains should fairly ring with the chants of “Feel the Bern!” That won’t leave many disaffected independents for Trump. But there still might be enough. The state’s Republicans tend to have a strong libertarian streak and are social moderates. While Rubio could be expected to do fine here, never count Trump out in the Northeast. The place to watch, not surprisingly, is Burlington’s county: Chittenden.

RACE FOR GOP NOMINATION: Trump builds delegate lead &#8212; but it's no lock,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/02/trump-builds-delegate-lead-but-its-no-lock.html,fox,3/2/2016 20:25:29,,"Donald Trump’s seven Super Tuesday wins helped pad his substantial delegate lead – but not enough to dispirit his top rivals, who still see a path to toppling the Republican front-runner and taking the fight to the convention if necessary.  
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, at the very least, seem determined to compete for every vote through the March 15 contests, which could make for the most consequential night of the GOP campaign.
That’s when the home states of Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich vote. And both states award every delegate on the table to the winner.
“If I win Florida, what does that math look like?” Rubio told XXX on Wednesday, brushing aside pressure to drop out.
Here’s where the delegate math stands now:
It takes 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination. Trump has 319; Cruz has 226; and Rubio has 110.
According to Associated Press estimates, Trump needs to lock down 52 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the party nod.
March 15 may provide the best clue as to whether that’s likely.
On one hand, if Rubio were to win Florida and Kasich were to win Ohio, they would continue to hold down Trump’s numbers even if he wins elsewhere.
On the other, a Trump victory in those states and beyond would truly give him an aura of inevitability – not to mention put immense pressure on Rubio and Kasich to drop out.
Rubio already is facing that pressure from Trump and Cruz, who wants non-Trump voters to unite behind his campaign, which he claims is the only one that can confront and defeat the billionaire businessman.
DELEGATES: WHERE DO CANDIDATES STAND NOW? | InsideGov
“So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation,"" he said Tuesday night. ""And, after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
Cruz and the rest of the candidates will have their next chance to make their case to the American public on Thursday, when they face off for a Fox News debate in Detroit, their first post-Super Tuesday showdown. 
One candidate has already bowed out of the event, Ben Carson -- who, after a disappointing Super Tuesday, announced he sees no ""political path forward,"" while stopping just short of suspending his campaign. The debate Thursday could see Rubio and Cruz ratchet up their fight for the not-Trump mantle, with Rubio clearly lagging right now in the race for second.  
Cruz won in his delegate-rich home state of Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska on Tuesday. Together with his leadoff win in the Iowa caucuses, Cruz has claimed wins in four states.
Rubio, who has seen GOP establishment figures line up behind his campaign especially since Jeb Bush dropped out, has struggled to account for his performance to date.
The senator did claim his first win Tuesday night in Minnesota. And – while touting the fact he’s picked up delegates even in states he didn’t win – he implicitly questioned Cruz’s ability to win in some of the upcoming contests, claiming several states coming up “look more like Virginia” where Rubio beat Cruz in the race for second Tuesday.
He’s referring to states like Illinois and even Michigan, with a more moderate primary electorate.
But Deep South states like Mississippi and Louisiana also are fast-approaching on the calendar.
“There are some states that are going to be favorable to [Cruz],” Cruz supporter and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told XXX. While a voting bloc thought to be Cruz’s strong suit – evangelicals – are still breaking for Trump in some Southern states, Abbott suggested those voters will start shifting soon to Cruz.
One scenario is for Rubio and Cruz to stay in the race if only to prevent Trump from achieving the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
Asked about that possibility, Rubio told XXX “we’re going to do whatever it takes” to prevent the nomination from falling into Trump’s hands – but said the plan is to clinch the nomination, not simply prevent Trump from doing so.
Rubio is putting it all on the line in Florida, meanwhile, vowing Wednesday that he’ll win.
Trump is threatening to crush those hopes, and cites polls that show him well ahead of Rubio.
“We're going to go to Florida. We're going to spend so much time in Florida. We've got about a 20-point lead,” Trump said Tuesday night, at a post-primary press conference in the Sunshine State.
Trump already is positioning himself as a general election candidate, increasingly taking swings at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who also had a good night on Tuesday with seven wins to Bernie Sanders’ four.
But he allowed, with the GOP race still open, that another candidate might also be able to take her on – taking another swipe at Rubio in the process.

According to The Boston Globe, Bill Clinton strolled into the Holy Name Parish School in West Roxbury alongside Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. But state law restricts electioneering (soliciting for or against any person, party or ballot question) within 150 feet of a polling place.
A video shows Clinton shaking hands inside the school gym where the voting was taking place, and reports say he was glad-handing everyone -- even kissing an old woman on the head - and stopped at a bake sale near the entrance and bought a cup of coffee. At one point, according to MassLive.com, he was asked by a woman inside to pose for a picture.

“As long as we’re not violating any election laws,” he said. The report said he spent 45 minutes at the West Roxbury location. It was one of several stops he made in Massachusetts, where his wife was locked in a Super Tuesday primary battle with opponent Bernie Sanders. Massachusetts is one state where the Vermont senator has given the former first lady a fight, according to the polls.
MassLive.com said Bill Clinton did not take press questions, nor did he appear to mention the election. At one point a woman told the former president that she had voted for Republican Ted Cruz, but that her 98-year-old mother voted for Hillary Clinton. He then took a piece of paper out of his pocket and wrote the mother a note.
While the Boston Globe confirmed with the Secretary of State’s office that the campaign had been “reminded” of the 150-foot rule, it was not clear when or where the reminder took place.
When asked by by XXX whether the ex-president was violating election rules, a spokesman for Secretary of State Brian McNiff said simply, “I don't know. He was just in there shaking hands and there's no law against that.""
He did mention that there were problems with traffic being obstructed and ""quite a crowd in New Bedford"" when Clinton stopped there earlier, but it did not shut down the polls."
Romney to make major speech on 2016 race,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/1ZrutPak4iY/romney-to-make-major-speech-on-2016-race.html,fox,3/2/2016 18:18:00,,"Mitt Romney will deliver a major speech on the state of the 2016 race for the White House Thursday, amid rising panic among some Republican leaders that Donald Trump may be cruising to the nomination. 
The 2012 Republican presidential nominee will speak at 11:30 a.m ET from the University of Utah. Exactly what Romney will say was not immediately clear, though there were no signs that Romney would either endorse a candidate or jump into the race himself.
Romney considered another White House run at the beginning of 2015 before deciding against the move, reportedly after being out-raised by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- who has since suspended his campaign.
Despite his decision not to run, there has been widespread media speculation that he could be tempted back into the race in the case of a contested Republican convention as a last gasp way to stop Trump.
The speech comes after Trump racked up a string of Super Tuesday wins, building a wide -- though not insurmountable -- delegate lead over closest rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
The former Massachusetts governor has become increasingly vocal in his opposition to the business mogul.
Last week, Romney told XXX’ Neil Cavuto that he believes there may be a “bombshell” in Trump’s tax returns, and called for Trump to release his returns as soon as possible.
He later criticized Trump for not immediately disavowing the support of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke.
Although Trump did later disavow Duke, Romney called his response “disqualifying and disgusting.”
A disqualifying & disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America.— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 29, 2016

Trump responded to Romney with barbs of his own, calling him ""one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.”"

Barring a seismic shift in voter sentiment, Donald Trump is expected to dominate the Republican primary field on Super Tuesday, adding to his already-sizable delegate lead – but Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are battling fiercely to be the definitive alternative to take on Trump in what could be a bruising, to-the-convention fight for the future of the party.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who's expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday -- though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support -- remains in the race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks.
“Super Tuesday was never anything that we ever thought was going to be some great thing for us,” Kasich openly acknowledged to XXX on Tuesday, also telling Fox Business Network there's ""zero chance"" he'd be anyone's running mate. 
Rubio, too, is looking ahead to the March 15 contest in his home state, even planning to hold his primary night rally there Tuesday.
But first, he’ll need to stay competitive with Cruz in the 11 Super Tuesday states awarding 595 total delegates.
There’s at least one state he stands a decent chance of winning, according to recent polling, and that is Minnesota. Rubio was holding a rally there Tuesday before heading to Miami.
Cruz, meanwhile, is the odds-on favorite in his home state of Texas – which, with 155 delegates, is the biggest prize of the night. In a sign of his expectations, Cruz planned his election night party in Stafford, Texas.
But because delegates can be allocated proportionally in the Super Tuesday contests (provided the winner’s margin of victory is not colossal), Rubio and Cruz both want to rack up a substantial number of second-place finishes.
A Rubio campaign aide told XXX they are ""focused on only one thing today: delegates.""
The polling is varied and in some states sparse, but RealClearPolitics averages show Cruz and Rubio likely are competing closely for second place in Georgia, Tennessee, Oklahoma and elsewhere. Rubio appears to have the edge over Cruz in Virginia and Massachusetts, while Cruz was actually leading one recent poll in Arkansas.
In the run-up to Tuesday, Cruz and Rubio both have stepped up their attacks on the front-runner, resorting to the kinds of personal insults and attacks that have defined Trump’s campaign style.
Rubio defended the new tack in an interview with XXX.
“Every now and then, someone like that needs a taste of their own medicine because that's called a bully and he’s using the pulpit of the presidency or the presidential run to insult people,” Rubio said.
Cruz told XXX that while Trump will have a “big chunk of delegates” come Wednesday morning, “We're going to have a big chunk of delegates, and there's going to be a huge drop off for everybody else.”
Trump, for his part, suggested Tuesday he wants to see Rubio “get out” of the race.
“He hasn’t won anything,” Trump told XXX. As for Rubio’s goal of a big win later this month in Florida, Trump said, “I don’t think right now he could be elected a dogcatcher in Florida.”
Trump wasn’t conceding the race against Cruz for Texas, either.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, defended his continued presence in the race on Tuesday.
“People have asked for somebody who is not a politician, who was a member of we the people, who has an outstanding life of achievement and who thinks the way they do,” he told XXX."

Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are less certain when the GOP presidential primary balloting closes Tuesday night.
The freshman senators are essentially tied for second in roughly half of the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses, including Alabama, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia.
The only delegate-rich state in which they were not second and third was Massachusetts, where Trump leads by 45 points, followed by Rubio at roughly 18 percent, then Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Cruz.
Cruz had a double-digit lead in his home state of Texas, which has 155 GOP delegates up for grabs, the largest number, followed by Georgia with 76.
Cruz has put a lot of resources into Texas, and a loss would be a major blow to his campaign.
Rubio, in a bit of gamesmanship, said, ""Tonight was supposed to be Ted Cruz's big night.""       
Rubio has yet to win an early-voting state and was not ahead in any polling before Tuesday. The other candidate in the GOP race is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is essentially last in polling.
The GOP field was competing Tuesday for a total of 595 delegates.
Cruz, who won the Iowa GOP caucus, has 17 delegates, one more than Rubio.
They have been locked in what has become a battle to win the support of the GOP establishment, which appears increasingly uneasy about Trump’s rogue campaign winning the party nomination.
Trump has 82 delegates after winning three straight contests -- the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries and the Nevada GOP caucus.
Rubio on Tuesday also ceremonially launched his campaign for the must-win primary in his home state of Florida, where Trump is comfortably ahead.
Rubio told reporters in Minnesota that he is looking ahead to the March 15 contest because he will have ""a lot of delegates.""
He's also predicting that the GOP contest will become so fierce that Trump will realize that he has “no chance"" of ever winning enough delegates to capture the party nomination.
Trump on Tuesday was in Kentucky, trying to woo voters at a rally in Louisville by saying President Obama has ""decimated"" the region’s coal industry.
The billionaire businessman said if he becomes president, coal will ""make a very big comeback.""

"Several GOP Senate, House incumbents vulnerable to Super Tuesday upset",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/BZu2e7dBdcc/several-gop-senate-house-incumbents-vulnerable-to-super-tuesday-upset.html,fox,3/1/2016 20:48:00,,"Remember in June 2014 when House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor was upset by a Virginia college professor named Dave Brat?
Well, the Super Tuesday balloting has the potential to produce a few more “Dave Brats,” or at least force some well-established Republican lawmakers like Cantor was into runoffs if they fail to get more than 50 percent of the vote.
Many of the races are in Texas, which because of its size has 38 House members -- 27 Republicans and 11 Democrats.
Their outcomes could be influenced by the GOP presidential primary turnout for Sen. Ted Cruz, trying to win his home state and close on front-runner Donald Trump, to say nothing of the general animus toward Washington.  
And groups aligned with Cruz have gone after several House GOP incumbents since he came to Capitol Hill in 2013.
Three chairmen of GOP-led House committees, who are all from Texas, are in competitive races: Reps. Lamar Smith at Science; Pete Sessions at House Rules and Kevin Brady at House Ways and Means, who took the gavel just months ago when Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan became House speaker.
GOP Rep. John Culberson, another Texan, also faces a primary challenge.
He isn’t a full committee chairman. He’s known on Capitol Hill as a “cardinal” because he’s chairman of the influential House Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds Commerce, Justice & Science programs (CJS).
Appropriations subcommittee chairmen are referred to as cardinals because they wield particular eminence over that section of federal spending.
Even Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert, one of the most-conservative House members, faces a primary challenge Tuesday.
GOP incumbents from Alabama are also in close races.
At the top of the list is Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby. He came to Washington as a Democrat, then switched to a Republican after the GOP took control of the upper chamber in 1994.
His record is being criticized amid the Supreme Court debate about whether President Obama should make a nomination to replace the late Antonin Scalia, and whether the GOP-led Senate should block such an effort.
Shelby has been criticized for holding up the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court (who ultimately wasn’t confirmed) in 1987 when Shelby was a Democrat.
Unlike fellow Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions, Shelby has not endorsed Trump.
Two House GOP members could face challenges tonight -- Reps. Martha Roby and Bradley Byrne.
At least one of the races not going to a runoff would be a surprise.
In 2014, Texas GOP Rep. Ralph Hall, then the oldest member of Congress, was forced into a runoff by John Ratcliffe, who eventually defeated Hall.
Runoff elections are frequently more challenging to incumbents because the challengers’ supporters are more energized and go to the polls."

Clinton and Trump are looking like the big winners according to most recent polls.
The way the GOP structured the primaries this season are working towards a quick nomination for Donald Trump. The new system was designed to make up for perceived flaws during the Romney nomination in 2012, but it’s front-weighting the nomination battle and that is helping Donald Trump. Nearly half the delegates for the nomination are at stake today.
Some in the GOP are saying they will not support Trump if he gets the nomination.
Reid Epstein in the Wall Street Journal today writes:
“A divisive battle is brewing in the Republican Party over the potential nomination of Donald Trump, as some party leaders warn they won't back him and could support third-party or write-in candidates.
Most party leaders still say they will back the party's nominee, and until recent days even Mr. Trump's loudest critics maintained they would back him in the general election if he wins the nomination.
That is beginning to change -- even as Mr. Trump is poised to win a string of Super Tuesday contests, and likely take the lion's share of the 595 delegates up for grabs today.”
Meantime, Hillary Clinton is already looking past Bernie Sanders to a likely battle with Donald Trump in the general election.
The Washington Post reporters Anne Gearan and Abby Phillip write today:
“Hillary Clinton and her allies are shifting their attention to a likely general-election contest against Donald Trump that they expect to be strongly negative - and for which they are planning an intensive effort to draw out minority voters who feel demonized by the billionaire real estate mogul. Clinton is still waging a hard-fought nomination battle against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont - including 11 contests on Tuesday - and some Democrats supporting her are wary of looking too far over the horizon. But increasingly sure that Trump will win the Republican nomination, Clinton appears this week to be running a two-pronged campaign against both Sanders and an eventual Republican opponent who sounds a lot like Trump.”
The WSJ reports that as many as 40% of the votes in some Super Tuesday states were already cast.. before polls even open.
The final batch of Hillary Clinton emails were released by the State Department.
President Obama meets with Senator Mitch McConnell today along with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley to discuss the vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Super Tuesday exit polls show divide among primary voters,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/WJqB0wEPq8Y/super-tuesday-exit-polls-show-divide-among-primary-voters.html,fox,3/1/2016 22:55:00,,"Early Super Tuesday exit polls are reflecting deep voter discontent across the country, with many saying they’re looking to an outsider to be the next president – though some are still uncomfortable with the idea of an outsider like Donald Trump claiming the Republican nomination.
The divide among GOP voters could be seen in several of the dozen states where polls are set to start closing soon.
In Georgia, Virginia and Massachusetts, early exit polls showed 50 percent or more of Republicans surveyed said they want an outsider.
That would appear a positive sign for a candidate like Trump. But in Georgia, 46 percent said they’d be dissatisfied if he were the nominee; in Virginia, that number was 52 percent.
Meanwhile, late-deciders in several states appeared to be breaking for Marco Rubio, including in Virginia, Georgia and Oklahoma. But Ted Cruz was getting the lion’s share of support from voters looking for someone “very conservative.”
With polls set to close soon, primary front-runners Hillary Clinton and Trump are aiming to rack up a daunting delegate lead and pull far away from their rivals in the nomination race.
The stakes are high.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates are up for grabs – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination.
And on the Democratic side, Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are battling for 865 delegates in 11 states – roughly a third of the number needed to clinch the nomination.
Clinton entered Super Tuesday with a head of steam following her landslide win over Sanders in South Carolina this past Saturday. She hopes her “firewall” of black voters holds up in several delegate-rich Southern states Tuesday, as she moves to sideline the still-popular Sanders from the race.
Barring a seismic shift in voter sentiment, Trump also is expected to dominate the Republican primary field Tuesday, adding to his already-sizable delegate lead – but Rubio and Cruz are battling fiercely for second, hoping to be the definitive alternative to take on Trump in what could be a bruising, to-the-convention fight for the future of the party.

SUPER TUESDAY OPINION  Clinton holds mathematical advantage over Sanders,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/03/01/hillary-vs-bernie-it-s-time-to-do-math-in-post-super-tuesday-world.html,fox,3/2/2016 5:06:06,,"Saturday night’s results in South Carolina were the start of something special for Hillary Clinton.
After a close to 50-point victory there where she garnered the support of over 80 percent of African-American voters, Clinton showed that her tough time in Iowa – where she won by less than half a percentage point – and New Hampshire where Sanders won by over 20 points, are a vague and distant memory.
How distant that memory is was clear Tuesday evening where Clinton won Super Tuesday handedly.  
Sanders had been running ahead in his home state of Vermont throughout the last two months and his big win there is no surprise. He also won Oklahoma and Colorado. He had also been hoping to make a play for Massachusetts.
So what does this mean for the future of the Democratic race?
Not a whole lot in terms of what you’re going to see in the day to day.
Bernie Sanders has made it clear that he will keep going until the convention this summer. He certainly has the money to make good on this promise – Sanders raised an astounding $43 million in February alone – and I have no doubt that he’ll continue raising funds at this level. Like Trump, Sanders has been successfully tapping into voter dissatisfaction and his populist message of addressing income inequality and reining in Wall Street has been deeply resonating with voters.
This isn’t apt to change and the media will continue to report that the momentum is on Sanders’s side as he draws huge crowds and raises millions.
It’s extremely unlikely that Clinton will start winning the youth vote back from him and she will instead focus on keeping the female vote and maintaining her support with the African- American community.
By the looks of it, and the turnout patterns we’ve seen thus far, this is going to be enough for Clinton to continue to on her path to the nomination. And much of this really comes down to the math.
To this end, when Sanders declared Tuesday evening that the contest has only begun because we still have 35 states left to vote, he’s not telling the whole story.
Clinton is amassing a big delegate lead and we know that she’s already far ahead with the Democrat superdelegates where she has the support of over 60 percent of them.
Sanders’s team knows what a tremendous advantage this is for Clinton as they’ve been reportedly trying to persuade superdelegates to reserve judgment until the popular vote totals are in. (This hasn’t been a particularly effective approach thus far).
It follows that, although it isn’t the glitziest way to win an election, Clinton is making it mathematically impossible for Sanders to win the nomination.
The #FeelTheBern movement was a powerful one, but it doesn’t look like it can go all the way."

At the top of that list, in both primary contests, is Texas. The Lone Star State has the biggest cache -- 222 Democratic delegates and 155 for Republicans.  
And perhaps no candidate is fighting harder for that prize than Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The senator went all out on Monday, holding rallies in voter-rich Dallas, Houston and San Antonio in hopes of at least defeating national front-runner Donald Trump in Cruz's home state. 
“We are going to have a very good Super Tuesday,” Cruz assured the Dallas crowd. Cruz has maintained a polling lead in the state, but knows a surprise loss there could doom his campaign.  
For Republicans, the second-biggest prize is Georgia, with 76 delegates at stake. Both Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio put in face time with voters Monday in the final hours before polls open, while Cruz stayed rooted in Texas.  
On the Democratic side, too, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have focused their efforts. 
While Clinton declared Saturday night after her decisive win in the South Carolina primary that the campaign was going “national,” the former secretary of state was concentrating Monday on two delegate-heavy states -- the Democratic-stronghold of Massachusetts (91 delegates) and Virginia (95 delegates).
Solid wins there and beyond on Super Tuesday could give her a nearly insurmountable delegate count toward the nomination. 
Clinton to date leads Sanders in the delegate count 543-to-85, including so-called superdelegates. They will compete for 865 delegates on Tuesday and a total of roughly 1,800 delegates over the next two weeks, with 2,382 needed to win the nomination. 
The delegates on the line in a dozen states Tuesday represent a third of those needed to clinch the party nod. 
And on the GOP side, 595 delegates are on the line Tuesday across 11 states -- nearly half the number needed to secure the nomination. 
Sanders is focusing on Minnesota and Colorado, progressive states where he hopes his message of social and economic equality will translate into votes.
“Americans don’t need crumbs, they need the whole loaf,” Sanders said at a rally in Minneapolis.
He is expected on Tuesday to win his home state of Vermont, which has 16 Democratic delegates. Minnesota is worth far more, with 77 delegates. 
Still, many of these contests divide delegates proportionally, and so Sanders is poised to walk away with some, even where he loses. His strategy appears to be to at least survive Tuesday, with hopes of a resurgence later this month in Maine and Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio.
On the Republican side, Trump has won three straight -- the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, and the Nevada Republican Caucus -- garnering 82 delegates.
Cruz kicked off the 2016 balloting by winning the Iowa Republican Caucus. He has 17 delegates, ahead of Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio with 16.
Though trailing in Texas, Trump holds big leads in other delegate-rich Super Tuesday states.
The billionaire businessman leads by double-digits in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia, according to RealClearPolitics poll averages. Rough 53 percent of the GOP’s 595 delegates on Tuesday are in those states.
Those polls were released before Trump over the weekend initially declined to disavow the backing of former KKK leader David Duke, which Rubio says makes him “unelectable.” 
Trump has since disavowed the support and blamed a supposedly faulty earpiece for his original handling of the question. 
The tough race is taking a toll on the candidates. Rubio, barnstorming the South to take hold of the GOP establishment mantle, temporarily lost his voice at a rally outside of Atlanta and needed South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has endorsed him, to take the microphone.
The two other GOP candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have six and four delegates, respectively."

The two other GOP candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have six and four delegates, respectively."

Like the Titanic’s architects realizing their fatal design flaw right around the first strains of “Nearer My God To Thee,” Republicans are waking up to the realization that their presidential primary scheme is more Frankenstein than Frank Gehry.
To protect an establishment frontrunner against an insurgent, the party frontloaded this year’s primaries and caucuses. Going into March, only 133 delegates had been allocated. Super Tuesday added another 595 delegates. By month’s end, 1,537 of 2,472 delegates will be gone.
The problem: no one figured that, for the first time in modern GOP history, the insurgent would wind up as the frontrunner.
Which leads to the second problem: Republicans looking to stop Donald Trump are running out of opportunities to derail him.
So far, 15 states have allocated delegates. By March 22, another 15 will have gone to the polls, leaving but 20 states between then and the first Tuesday in June (just 11 weeks) to change the GOP narrative.
Returning to the Titanic, let’s presume the Republican ship hasn’t taken on too much water and it’s still a viable contest.
How then to stop Trump?
My suggestion:
1. Keep The Field Populated. To the proposition that the only way to beat Trump is via a head-to-head contest: don’t buy the spin.
The latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Poll played out such scenarios involving Trump versus Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The results? Rubio lost by six points; Cruz, by 13.
Assuming Rubio soldiers on past the March 15 vote in Florida, he and Cruz need to strike an accord: they don’t attack each other; their super PACs stick it to Trump. And they draw straws to decide who has to call Jeb Bush to ask for his super PAC join in the Trump-bashing.
Syndicated columnist and XXX contributor Jonah Goldberg takes this unholy alliance a step further, suggesting a Rubio-Cruz ticket ala Reagan-Bush in 1980. I’m not sure it’s in Cruz’s DNA to be so magnanimous, since he leads Rubio in states won and delegates earned.
Trump may keep winning states moving forward, but from here on it’s a quantity-not-quality argument, with the goal being . . .
2. Keep Trump Under 50 percent. The number that matters most? It’s not states won, but the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination.
Of the 1,744 Republican delegates left on the board after Super Tuesday, 391 are in winner-take-all states. The two most important: Florida and Ohio, on March 15. Trump has to be stopped in one, if not both, to slow down the express (at present, he leads in both).
That leaves 1,353 delegates to be allocated either proportionally or by some hybrid scheme. Most crucial of all: states where a 50% majority winner earns all the delegates (Texas has such a system).
Before Super Tuesday, not counting South Carolina where Trump won all 50 delegates, he and Cruz-Rubio split almost equally divided 65 delegates (31 for Trump, 32 for the senators). If something similar occurs in the remaining proportional states, with Trump staying near his mid-30’s ceiling, there’s still a shot at wheeling and dealing in Cleveland.
But before we get there, we’ll have a few…
3. Showdown States. I mentioned Ohio and Florida as must-have’s for the anti-Trump forces. Here are three others to add to the list.
First up: Wisconsin’s April 5 primary, which comes after a two-week break in the action and where last week’s Marquette Law Poll has Trump up by 10.
As the state with the nation’s tenth largest Catholic population, it may be an opportune moment to revisit Trump’s rope-a-Pope. And don’t forget: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had some unkind words about The Donald as he ended his presidential bid.
After that: Indiana’s May 3 primary. The Hoosier State is home to America’s most prophetic county seat. By the first Tuesday in May, it’s an indication of which way the political class leans: Indiana Sen. Dan Coats is no fan; Gov. Mike Pence, who’s up for reelection this fall, hasn’t endorsed.
Finally: if there’s still a race, California and New Jersey on June 7 – again, after a two-week intermission. Establishment Republicans would love nothing more than embarrassing New Jersey Gov. Christie on his home turf. But it’s a winner-take-all state in Trump’s backyard (51 delegates). A more pragmatic strategy would be to go to California and take advantage of a system that awards delegates three apiece for each of the state’s 53 congressional districts.
And from there . . .
4. Outmaneuver Trump Now, Outwit Him Later In Cleveland. Let’s suppose Trump goes to Cleveland close to but shy of a guaranteed first-ballot victory (the GOP’s last multi-ballot convention: 1948).
If no one is elected on the first ballot, all 2,472 delegates can vote for whomever’s name had been placed in nomination. Which means: to outwit Trump in Cleveland, stack the deck with delegates willing to bail on Trump once their commitment is over.
The GOP’s 437 “pledged” delegates (269 Republican officeholders past and present, plus 168 members of the Republican National Committee) would be lowest hanging of anti-Trump fruit. From there, Cruz and Rubio delegates will have to unite.
If the GOP is serious about stopping the insurrection, it intervenes at the grassroots level and shops for voters not only willing to become delegates, but open to the idea of switching candidates at the convention, the political equivalent of changing horses midstream.
Can Trump still be stopped? Yes. But it requires a lot of odd-shaped pieces to fall in place.
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to sink into a leather chair and enjoy a cigar and brandy – while the violins play and the lifeboats are lowered.
Just in case the unsinkable doesn’t happen."
The distraction at Trump Doral is whether the PGA Tour stays,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/ffc9NmGi6b8/distraction-at-trump-doral-is-whether-pga-tour-stays.html,fox,3/1/2016 16:46:41,,"Donald Trump was a distraction at golf tournaments even before he was running for president.
Go back 15 years when the LPGA Tour's final event was held at Trump International in West Palm Beach. It was bad enough that Trump walked down the middle of the fairways as if he owned the place (which he did). In the second round, Karrie Webb hit a tee shot on the par-3 seventh that was short of the green and tumbling toward the water when light rough held it up.
Trump, who thinks golf isn't great unless it's hard, said that while Webb was a great player, that shot should have gone in the water. That night, his maintenance staff shaved the banks so severely that green spray paint was used to cover a few splotches of bare dirt.
Two years ago at Doral, Rory McIlroy hit 4-iron into the par-3 ninth during a practice round when he was asked to hold his position. Turns out The Donald was ready to leave, and his helicopter was parked near the walkway toward the green. McIlroy could only smile amid the roar of rotors and gusts as the helicopter took off.
At least it was a practice round. Trump caused an even bigger stir when his helicopter had players backing off shots at Turnberry in the first round of the Women's British Open last year.
Is he bad for golf?
Not at all.
But he might turn out to be bad for Doral, which has been part of the Florida swing longer than other PGA Tour event.
Trump has been scooping up properties from Scotland to Dubai, from Los Angeles to New York and Florida, for more than a decade. They are good courses, enough that majors from three tours will be held on them over the next six years — the 2017 U.S. Women's Open and 2022 PGA Championship at Trump National in Bedminster, New Jersey, and the 2017 Senior PGA Championship at Trump National in Potomac Falls, Virginia.
Whether those championship will be played at his courses is still to be determined. The PGA of America last year canceled its Grand Slam of Golf at Trump's course in Los Angeles shortly after his comments about Mexican immigrants when Trump announced his candidacy.
The other golf organizations tried their best to say as little as possible, waiting to see how his bid for the GOP nomination would play out. Odds are none of them saw Trump winning primaries, leading in the polls and gaining momentum going into Super Tuesday.
What now?
Of immediate concern is the World Golf Championship at Doral this week. The helipad was vacant on Tuesday and likely will remain that way for most of the week, although PGA Tour officials have been told that Trump is likely to make an appearance at some point, most likely Sunday.
This is the first time the top three players in the world — Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and McIlroy — have competed in the same event since September. That won't create a fraction of the buzz as when The Donald drops in.
That's not the problem, however.
Doral has been a popular part of the PGA Tour since 1962, and this could very well be the last one.
No one saw this coming in 2012 when Trump added Florida's most famous golf resort to his portfolio. He poured $250 million into the resort and had Gil Hanse redo the Blue Monster to make it more dramatic by bringing water into play more than it already was. It also has become too great an advantage for the long hitters, perhaps more than any other course on tour. Look at the top six from last year — Dustin Johnson, J.B. Holmes, Bubba Watson, Adam Scott, Henrik Stenson and Louis Oosthuizen.
Not everyone loves the redesign. That's nothing new, and it's not the issue.
It's Trump as a presidential candidate, and the bombastic dialogue that has become a staple of his campaign, which makes the future in Miami look bleak.
The PGA Tour has a contract with Doral through 2023, although there is a provision that a new title sponsor would have the right to take the tournament somewhere else. Cadillac is in the final year of its title sponsorship and is not going to renew.
The task is to find a new sponsor that doesn't mind the sideshow that Trump brings to a tournament.
If a new sponsor doesn't want to be at Trump Doral, there are not many other options in Miami with the property that can handle size of a World Golf Championship. The tour has looked at Crandon Park on Key Biscayne, a strong public course that once hosted a senior event. But with only one road to the course, that might not be practical.
The end of the PGA Tour in Miami? Now that's a distraction."

They still just can't seem to understand why American voters will not do their bidding and support Marco Rubio.
There’s plenty of book smarts among that crowd -- but no street smarts.
So let me explain what this election is all about.
It's about the hundreds of Indiana workers who just found out their jobs are heading to Mexico.
It's about the Disney employees who were fired -- and then forced to train their foreign replacements.
It's about a systematic invasion of our nation by illegal aliens -- while our government turns a blind eye.
It's about people like Kate Steinle -- murdered on American soil -- by an illegal immigrant.
It's about a war on religious liberty -- and our right to bear arms.
It's about a feckless government that refuses to acknowledge we are at war with radical Islam.
For the past eight years -- we have been told that America is no longer an exceptional nation -- that we are responsible for global chaos.
That Old Glory is a sign of racism and xenophobia.
The American people are fed up. And now we're serving notice on both parties: We are beholden to no one -- Republican or Democrat -- and if we have to burn down the village to save village -- then burn, baby, burn.
That's what this election is all about."
Trump builds delegate lead – but it's no lock,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/Q57mTwsTPGY/trump-builds-delegate-lead-but-its-no-lock.html,fox,3/2/2016 18:47:00,,"Donald Trump’s seven Super Tuesday wins helped pad his substantial delegate lead – but not enough to dispirit his top rivals, who still see a path to toppling the Republican front-runner and taking the fight to the convention if necessary.  
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, at the very least, seem determined to compete for every vote through the March 15 contests, which could make for the most consequential night of the GOP campaign.
That’s when the home states of Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich vote. And both states award every delegate on the table to the winner.
“If I win Florida, what does that math look like?” Rubio told XXX on Wednesday, brushing aside pressure to drop out.
Here’s where the delegate math stands now:
It takes 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination. Trump has 319; Cruz has 226; and Rubio has 110.
According to Associated Press estimates, Trump needs to lock down 52 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the party nod.
March 15 may provide the best clue as to whether that’s likely.
On one hand, if Rubio were to win Florida and Kasich were to win Ohio, they would continue to hold down Trump’s numbers even if he wins elsewhere.
On the other, a Trump victory in those states and beyond would truly give him an aura of inevitability – not to mention put immense pressure on Rubio and Kasich to drop out.
Rubio already is facing that pressure from Trump and Cruz, who wants non-Trump voters to unite behind his campaign, which he claims is the only one that can confront and defeat the billionaire businessman.
DELEGATES: WHERE DO CANDIDATES STAND NOW? | InsideGov
“So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation,"" he said Tuesday night. ""And, after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
Cruz and the rest of the candidates will have their next chance to make their case to the American public on Thursday, when they face off for a Fox News debate in Detroit, their first post-Super Tuesday showdown. 
One candidate has already bowed out of the event, Ben Carson -- who, after a disappointing Super Tuesday, announced he sees no ""political path forward,"" while stopping just short of suspending his campaign. The debate Thursday could see Rubio and Cruz ratchet up their fight for the not-Trump mantle, with Rubio clearly lagging right now in the race for second.  
Cruz won in his delegate-rich home state of Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska on Tuesday. Together with his leadoff win in the Iowa caucuses, Cruz has claimed wins in four states.
Rubio, who has seen GOP establishment figures line up behind his campaign especially since Jeb Bush dropped out, has struggled to account for his performance to date.
The senator did claim his first win Tuesday night in Minnesota. And – while touting the fact he’s picked up delegates even in states he didn’t win – he implicitly questioned Cruz’s ability to win in some of the upcoming contests, claiming several states coming up “look more like Virginia” where Rubio beat Cruz in the race for second Tuesday.
He’s referring to states like Illinois and even Michigan, with a more moderate primary electorate.
But Deep South states like Mississippi and Louisiana also are fast-approaching on the calendar.
“There are some states that are going to be favorable to [Cruz],” Cruz supporter and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told XXX. While a voting bloc thought to be Cruz’s strong suit – evangelicals – are still breaking for Trump in some Southern states, Abbott suggested those voters will start shifting soon to Cruz.
One scenario is for Rubio and Cruz to stay in the race if only to prevent Trump from achieving the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
Asked about that possibility, Rubio told XXX “we’re going to do whatever it takes” to prevent the nomination from falling into Trump’s hands – but said the plan is to clinch the nomination, not simply prevent Trump from doing so.
Rubio is putting it all on the line in Florida, meanwhile, vowing Wednesday that he’ll win.
Trump is threatening to crush those hopes, and cites polls that show him well ahead of Rubio.
“We're going to go to Florida. We're going to spend so much time in Florida. We've got about a 20-point lead,” Trump said Tuesday night, at a post-primary press conference in the Sunshine State.
Trump already is positioning himself as a general election candidate, increasingly taking swings at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who also had a good night on Tuesday with seven wins to Bernie Sanders’ four.
But he allowed, with the GOP race still open, that another candidate might also be able to take her on – taking another swipe at Rubio in the process.
“I don't think Marco is going to be able to beat her. …  I think Ted's going to have a very hard time. But Ted at least has a shot because at least he's won a little bit,” Trump said."
"Trump, Clinton Dominate Super Tuesday",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/gHP4s9lqxgM/trump-clinton-dominate-super-tuesday.html,fox,3/2/2016 14:38:00,,"Super Tuesday wasn’t a clean sweep, but it was a good night for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton won Texas, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Arkansas. Bernie Sanders won Vermont, Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma.
It wasn’t a terrible night for Bernie Sanders, but Clinton’s delegate lead now seems to put the nomination out of reach for the Vermont Democratic Socialist. Indeed, Hillary Clinton appears to be moving on to argue her case against Donald Trump.
Here’s how John Wagner put it in today’s Washington Post, “The senator from Vermont walked away with four victories to Hillary Clinton's seven, and most of hers were more decisive. She finished the evening with a significantly larger lead in the delegate count than when it started. With Tuesday's results, Sanders risked reverting to his original role as a message candidate, influencing the conversation with his relentless focus on income inequality but holding little hope of becoming the Democratic nominee for president.”
Donald Trump won seven states: Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia and Georgia.
Ted Cruz won Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska. Marco Rubio won Minnesota.
Unfortunately for GOP unity, no one is dropping out and it appears it will be a long fight.
Dan Balz writes in the Washington Post today,
“The window for stopping Donald Trump closed almost completely Tuesday night, leaving the demoralized anti-Trump forces with two weeks and no agreed-upon strategy for denying the New York billionaire the Republican presidential nomination.
Trump was on his way to a series of victories in a majority of the 11 contests that made up the biggest single primary-caucus night of the nominating season. His remaining rivals - Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Gov. John Kasich - and their allies were left to cling to the flimsiest of hopes that a reversal of his fortunes still lies on the near horizon.
For Rubio, the hope of many in the establishment, Super Tuesday turned into a super disappointment. He made a run at Trump in Virginia but fell short. Late Tuesday, he was declared the winner in the Minnesota caucuses. Still, that left his win-loss record this year at 1-14. Meanwhile, he was running third in at least half the states, and in some of those states his percentage of the vote was low enough that he was in danger of winning few or no delegates.”
 
But it wasn’t all good news for Mister Trump, Robert Costa and Philip Rucker write today in the Washington Post “Tuesday's results exposed some vulnerabilities for Trump: He lost late deciding voters in many states by wide margins to rival Marco Rubio, a sign that the senator from Florida may have had some impact with his withering assault on Trump's character. Ohio Gov. John Kasich also came close to beating Trump in Vermont.”
Patrick O'Connor and Janet Hook write in today’s Wall Street Journal,
“New York businessman Donald Trump won Republican primaries Tuesday from the Deep South to New England, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took his home state and Oklahoma, ensuring that the race for the GOP nomination will stretch into the spring.
The Republican front-runner won contests in at least seven states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia -- bolstering his claim on the nomination. Still, the pockets of resistance in others gave a glimmer of hope to detractors desperate for another candidate to take on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who also rolled to a series of victories on Super Tuesday.
The problem for Mr. Trump's rivals -- as it has been since the voting began -- is that there are too many of them for voters to coalesce behind a single alternative to the New York billionaire. In the past week, opponents have dramatically intensified their attacks on Mr. Trump after he steamrolled rivals in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.”
Here’s a couple of other headlines I found intriguing about the race so far:
Politico says “Hillary Clinton is pushing Sanders to the brink.”
The New York Times says “Donald Trump rolls on in a race that could drag on.”
Washington Post says “Trump owns Super Tuesday but Cruz and Rubio see glimmers of hope.”
Political Wire says “Ted’s not Dead Yet”, and “Rubio left gasping after Super Tuesday.”

Ted Cruz, with victories in delegate-rich Texas and in Oklahoma, is far from conceding anything.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, too, found reason to press on, with Super Tuesday wins in Minnesota, Oklahoma, Colorado and his home state of Vermont. Even Marco Rubio, after a string of second- and third-place finishes, found his first win in Minnesota.
But with Clinton amassing a huge delegate lead, the more competitive race is on the Republican side – where Cruz clearly edged Rubio in the Super Tuesday battle for second and quickly positioned himself as the better candidate to take on Trump.
“Tonight was another decision point, and the voters have spoken,” Cruz said in Texas, urging voters to unite behind him so he could take on Trump “head to head.” 
Even with the senators' victories, Trump emerged from Tuesday’s contests closer than ever to the nomination, and acting more and more like a general election candidate eager to take on Democratic front-runner Clinton.
“Once we get all of this finished, I’m going to go after one person, and that’s Hillary Clinton,” he said, at an unusual primary night press conference in Florida. “I think that’s frankly going to be an easy race.”
Speaking in Florida after notching several wins, Clinton also seemed to look beyond Sanders – taking implicit shots at Trump’s “make America great again” campaign slogan.
“America never stopped being great,” Clinton said. “We have to make America whole.”
She also mocked his proposal for a southern border wall, saying, “Instead of building walls, we’re going to break down barriers.” 
Trump answered right back, quipping: ""Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again."" 
With results still coming in, Trump is projected to win in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. Clinton is projected to win Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates were up for grabs Tuesday – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination. And on the Democratic side, Clinton and Vermont Sen. Sanders were battling for 865 delegates in 11 states – roughly a third of the number needed to clinch the nomination.
No matter how the delegate math shakes out, the primary races are not over – yet.
While the Super Tuesday contests marked the biggest day of primary season voting to date, the states were mostly allocating delegates proportionally, meaning even the runner-ups could add to their totals.
Rubio stressed that point, as he began to focus on the March 15 contest in his home state.
“We never said Super Tuesday was going to be our night,” he told XXX.
Cruz clearly had the better night.
Texas was the biggest prize on the Super Tuesday map, offering 222 Democratic delegates and 155 Republican delegates. A win for Cruz in his home state was considered critical, and he was able to thwart any potential late-hour surge by Trump there.
While Cruz put subtle pressure on Rubio to step aside, Trump openly mocked the Florida senator after earlier calling on him to drop out – a call Rubio rebuffed. Trump again called him a ""lightweight"" while threatening to take on the Florida senator in his home state in two weeks. 
Clinton entered Super Tuesday with a head of steam following her landslide win over Sanders in South Carolina this past Saturday.
Sanders, though, savored his home-state win all the same, rallying cheering supporters in Vermont Tuesday evening. 
""It is good to be home,"" he said, before shifting to his stump speech slams against a ""corrupt campaign finance system."" 
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the GOP race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.

While Trump was expected to dominate the Republican primary field, Rubio and Cruz were battling fiercely for second -- hoping to be the definitive alternative to take on Trump in what could be a bruising, to-the-convention fight for the future of the party.
Ohio Gov. Kasich, who's expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
“Super Tuesday was never anything that we ever thought was going to be some great thing for us,” Kasich openly acknowledged to XXX earlier Tuesday.
In a sign of his expectations, Cruz planned his election night party in Stafford, Texas.
But because delegates can be allocated proportionally in the Super Tuesday contests, Rubio and Cruz both want to rack up a substantial number of second-place finishes.
A Rubio campaign aide told XXX they are ""focused on only one thing today: delegates.""
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, but the senator vowed to go to all 50 states in a bid to thwart his presidential run.
In the run-up to Tuesday, Cruz and Rubio both have stepped up their attacks on the front-runner, resorting to the kinds of personal insults and attacks that have defined Trump’s campaign style.
Rubio defended the new tack in an interview with XXX.
“Every now and then, someone like that needs a taste of their own medicine because that's called a bully and he’s using the pulpit of the presidency or the presidential run to insult people,” Rubio said.
Cruz told XXX that while Trump will have a “big chunk of delegates” come Wednesday morning, “We're going to have a big chunk of delegates, and there's going to be a huge drop off for everybody else.”
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, has defended his continued presence in the race.
“People have asked for somebody who is not a politician, who was a member of we the people, who has an outstanding life of achievement and who thinks the way they do,” he told XXX."
"TRUMP, CLINTON SCORE STRING  OF 'SUPER TUESDAY' VICTORIES  Cruz wins Texas, Okla.; Sanders wins  Vt., Okla., Colo., Minn.; Rubio wins  Minn., his first of the primary season",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/02/trump-clinton-rack-up-super-tuesday-wins-cruz-keeps-foothold.html,fox,3/2/2016 5:06:06,,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton each scored a string of impressive primary victories Tuesday night that sent an emphatic message to voters and their respective political rivals that the primary season might be all but over, and the race for the White House is on -- though Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, with victories in delegate-rich Texas and in Oklahoma, is far from conceding anything.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, too, found reason to press on, with Super Tuesday wins in Minnesota, Oklahoma, Colorado and his home state of Vermont. Even Marco Rubio, after a string of second- and third-place finishes, found his first win in Minnesota.
But with Clinton amassing a huge delegate lead, the more competitive race is on the Republican side – where Cruz clearly edged Rubio in the Super Tuesday battle for second and quickly positioned himself as the better candidate to take on Trump.
“Tonight was another decision point, and the voters have spoken,” Cruz said in Texas, urging voters to unite behind him so he could take on Trump “head to head.” 
Even with the senators' victories, Trump emerged from Tuesday’s contests closer than ever to the nomination, and acting more and more like a general election candidate eager to take on Democratic front-runner Clinton.
“Once we get all of this finished, I’m going to go after one person, and that’s Hillary Clinton,” he said, at an unusual primary night press conference in Florida. “I think that’s frankly going to be an easy race.”
Speaking in Florida after notching several wins, Clinton also seemed to look beyond Sanders – taking implicit shots at Trump’s “make America great again” campaign slogan.
“America never stopped being great,” Clinton said. “We have to make America whole.”
She also mocked his proposal for a southern border wall, saying, “Instead of building walls, we’re going to break down barriers.” 
Trump answered right back, quipping: ""Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again."" 
With results still coming in, Trump is projected to win in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. Clinton is projected to win Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates were up for grabs Tuesday – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination. And on the Democratic side, Clinton and Vermont Sen. Sanders were battling for 865 delegates in 11 states – roughly a third of the number needed to clinch the nomination.
No matter how the delegate math shakes out, the primary races are not over – yet.
While the Super Tuesday contests marked the biggest day of primary season voting to date, the states were mostly allocating delegates proportionally, meaning even the runner-ups could add to their totals.
Rubio stressed that point, as he began to focus on the March 15 contest in his home state.
“We never said Super Tuesday was going to be our night,” he told XXX.
Cruz clearly had the better night.
Texas was the biggest prize on the Super Tuesday map, offering 222 Democratic delegates and 155 Republican delegates. A win for Cruz in his home state was considered critical, and he was able to thwart any potential late-hour surge by Trump there.
While Cruz put subtle pressure on Rubio to step aside, Trump openly mocked the Florida senator after earlier calling on him to drop out – a call Rubio rebuffed. Trump again called him a ""lightweight"" while threatening to take on the Florida senator in his home state in two weeks. 
Clinton entered Super Tuesday with a head of steam following her landslide win over Sanders in South Carolina this past Saturday.
Sanders, though, savored his home-state win all the same, rallying cheering supporters in Vermont Tuesday evening. 
""It is good to be home,"" he said, before shifting to his stump speech slams against a ""corrupt campaign finance system."" 
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the GOP race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, meanwhile, has defended his continued presence in the race.
“People have asked for somebody who is not a politician, who was a member of we the people, who has an outstanding life of achievement and who thinks the way they do,” he told XXX."
"Trump, Cruz team up to put squeeze on Rubio",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/0RXHKPaFr78/trump-cruz-team-up-to-put-squeeze-on-rubio.html,fox,3/2/2016 16:06:00,,"Fresh off their Super Tuesday wins, Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz jointly turned up the pressure on Marco Rubio to drop out -- though the Florida senator insists he remains a contender and is ""optimistic"" about turning the race around once his home state votes.
Trump won seven states in Tuesday’s contests, bringing his delegate count to 316. Cruz, who won three states, now has 226 delegates. Rubio, with one state win and some second- and third-place finishes, brings his tally to 106. 
For Rubio, he's eyeing the March 15 primary in his home state of Florida as the game-changer. 
But at least until then, Trump and Cruz are working to sideline him. 
At his rally in Texas, Cruz urged voters to unite behind his campaign, warning that Trump is on a glide path to the nomination until that happens.
""So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives, and for the nation,"" he said. ""And, after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump."" 
He strongly suggested to reporters that Rubio should reconsider his presence in the race. 
Trump, who has openly mocked Rubio for everything from excessive sweating to drinking water on camera, vowed to beat the senator in his home state. 
With 10 furled American flags and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie standing behind him, Trump poked fun at Rubio, referring to him as “the little senator” and “a lightweight.” 
""It was a very tough night for Marco Rubio,"" Trump said. 
Trump earlier called on Rubio to drop out, while stopping just short of repeating the call at his press conference. But he said, ""You've got to be able to win something.""
Shortly afterward, Rubio did notch his first victory in Minnesota. But he stresses that what matters is the delegates, and he's still adding to his tally.  
Rubio, who has repeatedly called Trump a “con artist” and slammed Cruz for not performing better on Super Tuesday, told XXX he’s not going anywhere.  
“Sixty-five percent of the people who voted yesterday across Super Tuesday did not vote for Donald Trump,” Rubio said. “He underperformed in virtually every state of the map.”
Rubio also had sharp words for Cruz.
“Let’s not forget that last night was supposed to be Ted Cruz’s big night. It was the night where he was going to sweep. The states were tailor made for the kind of campaign he was running. We beat him in Georgia. We beat him in half the states on the map.”
Rubio said the delegate counts will level out in upcoming winner-take-all primaries.  Rubio said he expects to win all of Florida’s 99 delegates up for grabs in the March 15 primary.
Across 11 states, 595 Republican delegates were up for grabs Tuesday – nearly half the number needed to clinch the nomination.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who expressed low expectations for Super Tuesday, remains in the GOP race in hopes of making it to the Ohio contest in two weeks, though his presence continues to frustrate efforts by Rubio and Cruz to consolidate support.
