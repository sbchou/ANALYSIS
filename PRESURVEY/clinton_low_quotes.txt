State of the Union,

One of my biggest differences has been on guns, and I'm very pleased that he flip-flopped on the immunity legislation. Now I hope he will flip-flop on what we call the 'Charleston loophole' and join legislation to close that,

I didn't use her; she answered a question and she gave a factual answer,

I'm just too busy campaigning,

No,

I was a little disappointed that what Chelsea said was just not accurate,

Well, if you consider a Medicare premium as a tax, you know, that's true ... But, at the end of the day, the middle-class family, getting rid of all private health insurance premiums will save thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs,

What I said, Jake, is that there were provisions in that legislation ending armor-piercing ammunition, making sure that we had safety locks for kids in that bill. That made sense to me,

I have a very good relationship with god, a great relationship with evangelical (Christian voters),

I would have not done it because it's confusing. Some people believe me when I said -- I mean, I swear to you, that's true. I had no idea ... I swear to you,

I don't know yet. I haven't thought of it. I'm thinking about this one,

You need it because I think PACs are a horrible thing,

Ted Cruz, he's got a lot of people putting big money in, probably maybe Goldman Sachs, we'll have to ask them. I mean, they have loaned him a million dollars. So, they certainly have control over him,

You can't have a cloud. You can't pick a candidate that may have a 5%, 10%, 20% chance. By the way, since that happened, there have been lawsuits filed,

Now, he's got a problem. He was born in Canada. He was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago, I mean, if you can believe that.

It's a very, very different thing because he was born here. He was born on the land. Ted was not born on the land.

I want to bring costs down and make improvements to it,

s proposed executive action on gun control and reminded the audience that a Republican president could easily undo the moves Mr. Obama is proposing. They can be undone the first day,

I am disturbed by the rhetoric I hear coming from the other side,

Its easy to tear down, its hard to build up. Its easy to insult, its easy to criticize,

Bryces story was so touching,

He cared so much about what this business provided to Adel  it was a gathering place, it was a place for family fun, and he was describing his dream of someday owning that,

 Mrs. Clinton continued. That is the American dream.

At the end of it, she said, I would love to stop by your small business,

 and I said, I would love that, too,

 Mr. Smith said introducing Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday. Nothing motivates you more to clean a business than having a potential president stop by.

s working-class voters were not impressed. Shrugging off the low score, Mr. Obama declared, My economic plan is better than my bowling.

 To which a man yelled, It has to be!

s gutter balls, challenging him to a bowl off. A bowling night, right here in Pennsylvania. The winner takes all,

I went for education in college so I could teach, but I fell in love with bowling,

 Mr. Smith explained to Mrs. Clinton in their first discussion. So thats my biggest thing, is the barrier of entry and financing.

We all know about the student loan debt, but Ive never heard anyone so persuasively link it to the slowdown in business startups,

Youve given me an insight that nobody else has,

 Mrs. Clinton said to Mr. Smith, and Im grateful to you.
