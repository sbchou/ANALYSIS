I'm totally open to a tariff. If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can't deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don't it. It's not fair trade.

I would tax China coming in, products coming in,

I would do a tax, and the tax  let me tell you what the tax should be: The tax should be 45 percent. That would be a tax that would be an equivalent to some of the kind of, you know, devaluations that they've done. They cannot believe that we haven't done this yet.

This is so  so incredible.

From the very beginning, Trump is a master of the not-so-humble brag. He sounds like hes thanking the crowd, but hes also thanking himself for being so awesome.

We  we have had, no matter where we go  you know, its a movement, folks. This is a movement.

Trump talks about building a movement, but he rejects the concept of social movement building as a process. He hasnt built anything unless he wins.

I think were going to do fantastically well in Iowa. I really think were going to do great there. And I could say, Oh, gee, if we came in the top four of five.

 Im not  Im looking to win everything. We want to run the table. We want to run it, because that sends a signal.

And, you know, weve been a little bit  we had to respond to Hillary. She came out with that  she came out  remember, she wrote  she said, Hes got a  hes demonstrated a penchant  I demonstrated  a penchant for sexism.

Trumps refusal to be bullied together with his passion for punching back (Sos your skirt- chasing husband, you hypocrite) is a winner. All the wusses who live in fear of being similarly attacked think hes crazy. On this point, hes the only sane man in the room.

Can you believe it? Me? Nobody respects women more than Donald Trump. That I can tell you.

Its normally not a good idea to repeat the attack of an opponent. But he doesnt follow normal rules.

So, we have to do it. You cant let people push you around. You cant let people tell lies. You cant do it.

You know, its interesting. One of the polls came out from CNBC and they said that if its Trump against Hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. I can see that.

Trump uses a high level of ambiguity of the subjects of his sentences. Consider the they in that paragraph. The first they is whom? Critics? The media? Researchers? The next six theys seem to be people who dont usually vote. But are all people who dont vote fed up with the corrupt, horrible system?

No, no, no. Theyre fed up. Theyre fed up with the media. I mean, Ive got  and you know, not all bad, but theres so much dishonesty in the media. And I like to call it out.

a handful of journalists represent a form of censorship.

And one of the things thats really been amazing to me, and such  its been so beautiful to watch  the level of genius in the public. They get it, you know? They really get it. They want to marginalize us, they want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like, Oh, gee.

Its hard to pull a quote from this kind of language because, without the aid of context, the reader doesnt know whats being said. And, its easier to disclaim interpretations of what was really meant by the comment.

The level of genius  they fully understand. They know theyre crooked, they know theyre dishonest and they really  otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me?

I love you. I do. I love you. I love every  you know what? The rooms, no matter where, whether its stadiums or big ballrooms like this one, its amazing, and theres love in the room.

Hes building an us-vs-them feeling.

This is going to change so fast. You know, last year, $500 billion trade deficit with China. Think about it. You know what $500 billion is? You do  you do $100 bills, you would fill the room to the ceiling, $500 billion deficit  trade deficit with China.

Our leaders are stupid and  and/or  you have to say and/or they have deals, because whats happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists, and these lobbyists make our leaders do  our leaders, can you believe our leaders?

He is a masterful communicator and can work a crowd, and he has very successfully tapped into the rage that many Republican voters feel. Voters feel like they know him because he connects with what they are thinking and feeling.

If youre going to do an ad, do an ad. But hes a low-energy person. Lets face it. We dont need low-energy. We need lots of energy.

Trumps oft-repeated criticism of Jeb Bush attempts to emasculate a political elite as someone not virile enough to run the country. Trump makes repeated references to his own success and his supermodel wife.

But I go home (after a debate), and I watch, and the pundits will say  and they cant totally kill me, because we know it is happening, we know whats happening  well, Mr. Trump was OK tonight. He was  I won every single online poll, I won.

He loves to be number one, but the question is how will he take it in some of the states where he might not be in the lead and he comes in number two or number three?

takes the ad  and I shouldnt even talk about him. Hes down to two or three  I  but it bothers me when I see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right? I say, why is he doing this? Doesnt he have something better, he should go home.

Another rule he breaks: Talking about the campaign, about process. Hes barely talked about any issue or platform. Just his success.

I said, Jeb, Im at 42, you are at 2. Right?

 It is a simple answer. You started off here, right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there, by the next time, you are going to be off the stage. Right?

Its very personal for him. He doesnt like his opponents.

Hillary is controlled by her money. So is Jeb. So is  by the way, Im the only one self-funding my campaign. Im self-funding.

You know, one of the things that makes me happy. I heard one of my commentators this morning, said, You know, Ive been watching this stuff for 50 years and Ive never seen anything like what has happened with Trump.

Heres an interesting omission: Trump never calls himself a Republican or a conservative in this speech. He also never attacks the Democratic Party as a whole. Instead he attacks individual candidates who he labels enemies.

 Hes running in the Republican primary, but rhetorically he sounds like an independent candidate.

Isnt that nice? Thats a very  every once in a while, somebody can say something that hits you. Where are you? Who said that? Wow. So nice. Thank you. That is a nice one. Thats like, you know, every once in a while, there is a statement that is either nice or brutal. I think low-energy was a brutal statement, right?

His rhetorical style is nothing more than stream of consciousness, floating from one thought to another, frequently unrelated, thought. Much of his seemingly interior monologue is in praise of himself  how great, strong, brilliant, smart he is  while attacking, belittling and demeaning anyone who dares to question Donald Trump.

Low-energy can be applied to Hillary. I just dont like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies. Right? Because I consider them enemies. We view this as war. Dont we view this as war? Its war.

Yeah, he really doesnt like them.

We are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared. General Odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember. And I think he went back to the beginning, but lets say Second World War. OK? Thats enough.

Putin comes out, he said, Donald Trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack. OK, thats nice.

really brilliant and talented person without any doubts.

s flattery of the Moscow strongman has drawn criticism. When a cable news host pointed out that Putin kills journalists, political opponents, and invades countries,

 Trump responded: At least hes a leader, unlike what we have in this country.  Our country does a lot of killing also.

If we have Hillary  Ive got to tell you. I just saw where for the last week shes been hitting me really hard with the women card, OK? Really hard. And I had to say OK, thats enough, thats enough. And we did a strong number. Shes not going to win. Any by the way, I love the concept  I love, love, love having a woman president. Cant be her. Shes horrible. Shes horrible.

Trump jumps from one topic to another. And as he notes a particular issue he does so to point out that things are currently horrible (with health care, education, foreign policy, etc.,), that hell easily fix whatevers wrong while offering no specifics or evidence to support his claims.

And you know really dont  Ill tell you who does not like  yeah, well get Ivanka. Good. Lets do Ivanka.

It would be really disappointing  not really  but it would depend on whats inside the magazine,

 Donald Trump said. I dont think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. Ive said if Ivanka werent my daughter, perhaps Id be dating her.

But Ill tell you who doesnt like Hillary are women. Women dont like Hillary.

I see it all the time. And always so theatrical.

Irony: Whos more theatrical?

Mr. Trump said this and that and this. And you just  I actually  I shouldnt do it. I just have to turn off the television so many times. She just gives me a headache.

Look, weve got to be tough, weve got to be smart, weve got to have heart too. Weve got to have heart, weve got to take care of people. Weve got to fix our health care program.

In previous election cycles, people have wanted a 10-point plan from their candidates. Now, theyre so disgusted with what theyve seen from the Obama administration that they just want someone different, someone from outside the politics-as-usual crowd. They are attracted to someone like Donald Trump, who is larger than life, has his pulse on blue collar America, is saying what many of them are thinking (but cant say), and is building his campaign on making America great again.

And the other people that are really paying for it are not signing up. And your rates are going up 25 percent, 35 percent, 45 percent.

hes cherry-picking the high end of premium changes to come. Estimates for the national average are far below Trumps figures, ranging from 4.4 percent to 13 percent.

Your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, youre never going to be able to use your deductible. Youre never going to be able to use it. So Obamacare is a disaster. We are going to repeal it, we are going to replace it.

Hes clever to only talk problems and not solutions. Very little to get caught up in. Ben Carson blew up because he offered silly solutions.

There are so many great things we can do on health care. So many good things.

s website offers no specifics on how Trumpcare might work. He has said in debates that hes OK with tax-sheltered health savings accounts. Asked if he thought such savings accounts might mean Medicare wouldnt be necessary, he said, Well, its possible.

Im number one by a lot and I spent no money. I mean, my plane cost me some money, but I spent no ads. Took a little radio ad in Iowa. But I didnt do that  I took  I think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth. But I spent essentially no money.

The politicians can pretend its something else, but Donald Trump calls it radical Islamic terrorism. Thats why hes calling for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until we can figure out whats going on. Hell quickly cut the head off ISIS and take their oil. And hell stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our Southern border that Mexico will pay for.

And then you have all these other guys spending vast  and they like the way the United States is run. Now, why would we put a guy like Jeb, like some of the others. Its not only Jeb Bush. They spend money. I see Rubio on the ads all day long.

Again, using his campaign as a metaphor for how he would run the country. Most candidates avoid that.

Then they have the 24-day inspection, but the self-inspection is the beauty. We think youre making nuclear weapons here.

 Well, let us go check, Mr. President, well check.

 No, sir, were not making nuclear weapons. Nobody  no, were not. We would never do a thing like that.

Hes very good at painting word pictures. Helps people imagine a situation well.

If we keep going like this, folks, were not going to have a country left. Were not going to have a country. Were not going to have a country.

Part of Trumps allure is not what he says but how he says it. Every person running for president has an ego so enlarged that psychiatric counseling is called for. The rest of them dish out faux humility til ones gorge rises up. Trump just lets his ego strut. In this sense, he's real and the rest are fakes.

Believe me, the enemy doesnt want to be killed. You know, you hear so much, oh, they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right?

They dont. They want to live. And they want to take care of their families, always their families. You remember that, because their families know whats going on OK? You think their wives dont know what they are planning? You think their kids dont know exactly what Daddy is doing when Daddy is going to fly into the World Trade Center?

Why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place? So what happens? So we have ISIS taking a lot of oil. I said take the oil. Remember when we left, I was opposed to going in because I said youre going to destabilize the Middle East.

Its actually a pretty sophisticated argument, but spelled out very simply.

So, (Obama has) got a problem with the carbon footprint. You cant use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone.

 and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you  its stuck in your hair and you say oh my God, Ive got to take a shower again. My hairs all screwed up, right?

He actually is displaying some humility. Laughing at ones self is always a good tactic. Its also sparingly used by his opponents.

Were going to win so much youre all going to get sick and tired of winning. Youre going to say, oh, no, not again. Im only kidding. You never get tired of winning, right? Never.

He doesnt complicate this narrative with any nuance or details as to his specific policies or remedies or how he will bring about change if elected.

A lot of you dont know we protect Germany. Germany! Mercedes Benz, how many people have a Mercedes Benz? We protect Germany. Its an economic behemoth.

Hes channeling populist economic grievances.

First hour when the (Make America Great Again) hats were announced, I get a call from The New York Times. Mr. Trump, where are those hats made?

 I said, America.

But heres the story. Weve got to build a wall. They think Im crazy when I say Mexico.

Trump jumps from one topic to the next and back again at random. However, this abrupt transition is actually a smart way of linking immigration to free trade. Hes joining his theme of America as a dumping ground for migrants with his criticisms of trade policy that he believes make America a dumping ground for cheap foreign goods.

I dont want to wait for your freaking applause.

This is possibly first utterance of the word freaking in American politics.

And when I started this journey, and it is a journey, and I do love you people. Youre amazing people. And by the way, you are so smart.

His audience seems adoring, often yelling that they love him (and he responds, I love you too!

). This movement seems more of a cult of personality in which hes the entertaining carnival barker.

Its not right. Its a noisy majority. People are angry. Its a noisy majority. These arent silent people anymore. I go to people  you cant even hear.

Although Trump says his audience is young, this reference to a Richard Nixon speech from 1969 would resonate most with older voters. Nixon believed the silent majority was patriotic and did not participate in the social protests of the 1960s. However, Trump is saying that the country has become so bad that the silent majority is becoming (and must become) vocal.

Ted Cruz, who is a nice guy  said, Were going to build a wall at the southern border.

 I said, Look where did that come from, right?

 No, Teds a good guy.

Ted Cruz, who Trump calls a nice guy,

 is in Trumps estimation a cheap foreign copy of himself. Nice is also an insult  hes not tough enough to deal with Americas problems.

When I  when I started the journey, it was amazing. I came down  it took courage. I went down into the lobby of Trump Tower, on the escalator with Melania. I have never seen  it looked like the Academy Awards, the press. We have a lot of press here today. Theyre all live  look at all those live cameras.

This makes people feel theyre at an event thats historic.

So when I came down  when I came down on the escalator, we came down. And I said, Were going to do things.

 And I mentioned illegal immigration. You wouldnt even be talking about illegal  it wasnt even on the radar. Nobody was talking about illegal immigration. Is that right? Now, its one of the big subjects.

When discussing immigration, Trump always refers to illegal immigration,

 a term rejected by supporters of immigration as offensive. He uses undocumented,

 the preferred term only once, when referring to Syrian migrants, and he takes its meaning literally: We dont know who these people are.

 Rather than assuming he doesnt know what the term means, this is instead a clever way of redefining undocumented in the immigration debate.

Hillary Clinton said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump. And yes  and theyre looking forward to it.

Analysts cannot let go of their pre-conceived notions and detect new trends. You could tile a path to the moon with comments of pundits who predicted that Trump would not be a serious candidate and that he would fade away when voters got serious.

The Iran deal is the worst deal Ive ever seen negotiated, OK? Im wrong. You know what the worst deal is? Irans a part of that one too. We gave them Iraq. Thats even better. Think of it. We gave Iran Iraq. Iran has the biggest  think of it. Theyre going to have the richest oil  if you go to Iraq, take a look. Among the largest oil reserves in the world.

Note the extreme informality of the language. Trumps speeches sound as if hes generally saying whatever pops into his mind, and that he has no intent to clarify or provide a rationale for positions. This matches well a style that would appeal to his biggest supporters  males who do not have a college education. Politico indicates 74 percent of non-college men who identify as Republicans or Republican-leaning independents have a favorable impression of Trump, compared with 57 percent of male college graduates.

Dont sit back and say, oh, Trump is going to do well. The more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense, because it is like a mandate. But you have got to go out and vote.

There is a rich tradition of political experts not being able to assess new trends in electoral behavior. A few weeks before the election in 1948, a Newsweek poll of 50 respected political journalists all predicted a Thomas Dewey victory over Harry Truman.

But we will make America great again, I promise. Thank you.

I thought it was very unfair to Ben Carson and to the governor. I thought it was pretty unfair because they weren't asked many questions,

I think he should apologize for his foul mouth. I think it's a disgusting thing he said,

I think maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted, what do you think?

I'm going to be bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are Hispanics,

If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Tower, he'll be using illegal immigrants to do it,

The wall just got ten feet taller.

Cruz has reviewed the bill now and will not prevent it from moving forward,

Why won't Ben Carson drop out?

The real question underneath this is, OK, if you take money from Wall Street, can you regulate Wall Street?

one of the most serious public health crises in the modern history of this country,

systemic.

Well miss him, but well do our work,

 Breyer said during an appearance at the Newseum in Washington. For the most part, it will not change.

If I did that there would be a uproar!

I volunteered to join Mr. Trumps campaign because he is a champion of working families; not Washington-Wall Street elites.

Such an honor and privilege to fight for a great man that has the experience we know, and the leadership we trust!

I can't imagine Romney having the gall coming out (and calling) for anybody's tax returns,

defund it.

As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life,

millions and millions of women [with] cervical cancer, breast cancer, are helped by Planned Parenthood.

So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood, that are helped greatly. And I wouldn't fund it. I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent,

I would defund it, because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.

Tonight we lost. I congratulate Secretary Clinton on a very strong victory,

We cant let this go on because our politics is pulling this country apart,

On to Super Tuesday,

Todays politicians need not shed tears for tomorrows children.

have many answers in it.

How much do we really know about Donald Trump?

The way the parties are framing this election is vastly different,

 conservative commentator S.E. Cupp said. Republicans from Donald Trump to Ted Cruz are talking about anger. Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, are talking about Obama and preserving his legacy.

I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big sides,

With that being said. I'm totally pro Israel.

totally pro-Israel,

This is another area where Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and I disagree with them strongly,

I would note: missing from Donald's answer is what he has done defending Israel.

The position you've taken is an anti-Israel position,

They teach their four-year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing.

I will be on Israel's side every single day.

He will never be able to do it,

I think I may be able to do it.
