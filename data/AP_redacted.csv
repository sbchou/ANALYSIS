XXX delegate count: Trump not yet on track to win nomination,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US--GOP%202016/id-14716e4ee74e437caa21874223eb771a,ap,3/2/2016 20:49:56,,"Despite Donald Trump's string of Super Tuesday victories, the billionaire businessman must do even better in upcoming primaries to claim the Republican presidential nomination before the party's national convention this summer, an XXX delegate count shows.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is emerging as the candidate who might stop him  with a little help from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
The good news for Trump: He is in a better position than any of his rivals. Through the first 15 states of the 2016 campaign season, the best chance for Cruz, Rubio or any of the other candidates could be a contested national convention in July that would almost certainly wreak further havoc on the deeply divided Republican Party.
""I think anybody that precludes any possibility at this point doesn't understand what's going on,"" said John Jordan, a California-based Republican donor now supporting Rubio. ""Anything can happen.""
While Trump has racked up 10 wins so far, he's won only 46 percent of the delegates awarded since voting began. It takes an outright majority of delegates to win the nomination.
To win enough delegates to claim that prize, Trump would have to win 51 percent of the remaining delegates awarded in the state-by-state contests scheduled through early June. That could be difficult if three or more candidates stay in the race.
Republican leaders in Washington and in statehouses across the country are scrambling to stop Trump
Trump's main Republican opponents are vowing to stay in the race until the end. And that could prevent him from getting the delegates needed to win the nomination outright  even if they can't overtake him on their own.
""We're beyond the winning states stage. This is now purely a competition for delegates,"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said.
Rubio, in a Tuesday interview on Fox News, promised to campaign in all 50 states, ""even if I have to get in my pickup truck and drive all over this country. I will do whatever it takes to prevent a con artist like Donald Trump from ever becoming the Republican nominee.""
While not giving up on beating Trump before the convention, both the Cruz and Rubio camps concede that their best opportunity could come at a contested convention in July.
That happens only if no candidate takes a majority of delegates before then. Under such a scenario, delegates on the floor of the Cleveland convention would decide on their own whom to support in a series of floor votes.
Not since 1976 has there been a contested convention.
Some Republicans warn of dire consequences should the party go that route this year, especially if Trump has a commanding delegate lead.
""If the establishment thinks there's a backlash now, wait until the guy with the most delegates gets to the convention and they decide to take it from him,"" said GOP operative Hogan Gidley. ""Then you're going to see an all-out political jihad.""
The Republican campaign now enters a critical two-week stretch ahead of the March 15 primaries. These are the first primaries that can award all of a state's delegates to the winner, and the two big prizes are Florida and Ohio. Florida has 99 delegates, Ohio 66.
Winning those states could boost Trump to a commanding lead in the delegate count, but Florida is Rubio's home state and Ohio is home for John Kasich, the state's governor.
Only nine states award delegates winner-take-all. Five more make it possible for one candidate to win all of the delegates, or at least a large majority. These states could take an outsized role in determining who wins the nomination.
Among the other winner-take-all primaries:  Arizona on March 22, Nebraska on May 10 and New Jersey on June 7.
The delegate math from Super Tuesday shows how difficult it can be to rack up a big lead when states award delegates in proportion to the vote.
Trump won seven of 11 states, but his gains were limited by Cruz's big win in delegate-rich Texas  his home state. For the night, Trump won at least 237 delegates and Cruz won at least 209. Rubio was a distant third with at least 94.
There were still 33 delegates left to be allocated on Wednesday.
Cruz won at least 99 of the 155 delegates at stake in Texas. Trump got at least 38, with 14 left to be awarded. Rubio picked up four.
Overall, Trump leads the field with 319 delegates and Cruz has 226. Rubio has 110, Kasich has 25 and Ben Carson has eight.
It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president."

Voters in a dozen states put their imprint on the race, and in the bulk of contests rewarded the national front-runners, stretching their leads in delegates needed to clinch the nomination and making them ever harder to stop.
In short, Super Tuesday unfolded in largely expected ways when what the alternatives to Trump and Clinton really needed was the unexpected  something to jolt the sense that they are at risk of being left inexorably behind.
Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas each won their home states and prevailed in Oklahoma, with several states still to be decided.
Clinton won Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia, Texas and Arkansas, the state her husband, Bill, served as governor on his way to the presidency.
Trump took Alabama, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Georgia, Virginia and Arkansas as attention turned to Western states reporting later.
A look at biggest day in the calendar of presidential primaries and caucuses.
___
HOW THEY WON
Clinton dominated again with older people and ate into Sanders' support among the 30-to-44 crowd. Sanders had a clear advantage with only one age group: his devoted under-30 followers.
Trump and his rebel yell against the status quo attracted nearly two-thirds of voters looking to install an outsider in the White House. Those who cared more about political experience split about evenly between first-term Sens. Rubio and Cruz, according to early results of exit polls.
___
WHAT'S THE SCORE?
With results still coming in, Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday delegates, while Cruz picked up at least 52. Overall, Trump leads the Republican field with 221 delegates.  It takes 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination.
Clinton was assured of gaining at least 334 delegates from Super Tuesday, with Sanders getting at least 145. Counting superdelegates, the Democratic insiders who can choose any candidate, Clinton now has at least 882 delegates. It takes 2,383 to win the Democratic nomination.
Clinton and Trump have each won at least nine states since the nomination contests began. It's at least three each for Sanders and Cruz.
___
RUBIO'S RUBICON?
For all the endorsements, money and attention rallied behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as the GOP's only hope to stop Trump, he's yet to win a state and short on time to stage a turnaround.
His home state will be a battleground royale on March 15, with part-time Floridian Trump running hard to knock him out of the race and avenge the lacerating taunts coming almost constantly from the senator since the last debate.
___
EXIT POLLING
In six states (Texas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas), large majorities of Republican primary voters expressed support for temporarily banning all non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S., a Trump proposal, according to early results of exit polls.
But Republican voters were more divided on another of his contentious ideas, to deport all people who are in the U.S. illegally. The proposal won majority support only in Alabama, among seven states where that question was asked of GOP voters.
___
VOTERS SAY...
""Ultimately, if we have to elect someone who is borderline crazy to get people to understand what's going on, then that's what we have to do.""  Tyler Murphy, 26, of Boston, explaining his vote for Trump in the Republican contest.  His backup choice was Clinton, a Democrat.
""I'm so appalled at the choices."" Gillian Gattie, 72, also of Boston. After 2008 and 2012 votes for Barack Obama, she was voting this time in the GOP race, for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
""I can't get excited for Bernie Sanders.""  Gillian's twin sister, Vivien Gattie, who reluctantly voted for Clinton.
""I stood in line for six hours the other day at a Trump rally because to me he's just the man. He is the one that is going to make the country great again.""  Jeanie Lindsey, in Helena, Alabama.
___
THE LINEUP
Both parties held contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. As well, Republicans voted in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also had a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats abroad.
___
______
WHY IT MATTERS
Immigration policy, the swollen U.S. debt, the uneven spread of wealth and hard questions about how to approach the Islamic State, terrorism and civil liberties are all in play for voters.
So is the fate of fundamental social policy as the Supreme Court stands ideologically divided. A vacancy may not be filled until after the next president takes office in January.
___
TEXAS AND THE SOUTH
The South enjoyed more influence in this campaign because of several states added to the Super Tuesday roster, giving this subset the nickname ""SEC primary,"" a nod to the Southeastern Conference of college sports. Clinton once again demonstrated her pull with black voters, as she did in overwhelming fashion in South Carolina over the weekend.
The biggest Super Tuesday state overall was Texas, where Cruz prevailed with his home-state advantage, prime endorsements from the governor down the political chain and a veritable army of some 27,000 volunteers."
XXX News Guide: Super Tuesday is super 'nail-bitey',http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election-News%20Guide/id-bf84766c57ea4f6c8c30c08bab25f93c,ap,3/1/2016 9:22:27,,"Super Tuesday is the big gulp moment for any presidential candidate who makes it that far. It's the biggest day of competition in American democracy except for Election Day itself. It's super nail-bitey, super expensive and often super-clarifying  the killer and maker of dreams.
So will it set everything straight in the chaotic presidential race?
Maybe. Quite possibly not.
___
MARCO 'RAMBO' & CO.
Five Republicans are still mixing it up, but all the bellowing is either by or about GOP front-runner Donald Trump. The New Yorker is driving toward the Republican nomination and his rivals are trying to splatter him with everything they have.
Tuesday will answer whether Marco Rubio's debate-night transformation from bland RubioBot to Marco Rambo can begin to take down the months-long leader in preference polls and now delegates.
The fight that the Republican establishment long wanted has been engaged. Whether it's too late to stop the outsider capitalist-populist is the question.
And it's not all high-minded rhetoric by any means. Trump made fun of Rubio's ears; Rubio cracked that Trump may have wet his pants during the debate.
Similar suspense, with fewer insults, animates the Democratic race.
Hillary Clinton, the establishment pick, scored a weekend blowout in South Carolina on Saturday, looks strong in many Super Tuesday states and would become an overwhelming favorite for the nomination if she performs to expectations.
A surprise could reinvigorate Bernie Sanders, her socialist-populist rival who has tapped deep political passions but needs more actual victories, and soon.
___
WHY IT MATTERS
Immigration policy, the swollen U.S. debt, the uneven spread of wealth and hard questions about how to approach the Islamic State, terrorism and civil liberties are all in play for voters.
So is the fate of fundamental social policy as the Supreme Court stands ideologically divided. A vacancy may not be filled until after the next president takes office in January.
Trump's agenda lacks detail on most fronts and often seems improvised. But there's little doubt about his intended approach on several major matters.
He would try to browbeat trading partners and others into doing his will. He would be on the hook for somehow carrying out mass deportations of people in the country illegally, for temporarily banning non-U.S. citizen Muslims from coming into the country and for replacing President Barack Obama's health care law with a system that does not, as he put it, leave people to die on the street.
Democrats have a choice between liberal pragmatism and liberal ambition.
Sanders preaches free college, a transformation of health care to a government-financed ""Medicare-for-all"" system and a breakup of big banks as part of an agenda centered on shrinking the gap between rich and poor.
That means a far heftier safety net, at the cost of higher taxes and what a lot of economists say would be higher national debt. Clinton says his goals are politically impossible and she would follow an achievable, yet still activist path.
___
A TRANSITION
Until now, it was ephemeral. Who's doing better and worse than expected? Who's rising and falling? Who's got, you know, momentum?
It's mainly about the number of delegates now  the inexorable grind of arithmetic.
Until now, voters in four states have picked not much more than a sliver of the delegates who are needed to clinch the party nominations.
That changes overnight, with each party holding contests in 11 states. Democrats also vote in American Samoa.
Republicans will allocate 595 delegates from the results of Super Tuesday, nearly half of the 1,237 needed for the nomination.
Democrats will allocate 865, more than one-third of the necessary 2,383.
___
WHAT'S THE SCORE?
3-1 for Trump and Clinton.
He won New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. She won Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina.
Republican Ted Cruz won Iowa. Sanders won New Hampshire.
In the Republican delegate race: it's 82 for Trump, 17 for Ted Cruz, 16 for Rubio, 6 for John Kasich and 4 for Ben Carson.
In the Democratic race, factoring in the hundreds of superdelegates, or party insiders who can support a candidate of their choice, Clinton leads with 546 delegates, according to XXX's count, while Sanders has 87.
___
MOMENTUM STILL COUNTS
As enormous as the prize is on Tuesday, no one candidate can win their party's nomination on the night. The delegate trove is proportional in each party, and delegates will be divvied up according to how well each contender does.
That's an oversimplification of an arcane process, but the bottom line is that a strong second place in a particular state can be worth almost as many delegates as a victory. So the perception of who's making headway still matters. A candidate on the move can attract more money, national attention and voter interest.
At least for a few more weeks.
A series of winner-take-all Republican primaries is coming, none bigger than Florida on March 15, where a cache of 99 delegates is at stake and Rubio will be bidding furiously for a home-state victory against Trump, a part-time resident who got a head start on organizing there.
___
TEXAS AND THE SOUTH
The South bid for more influence in this campaign by adding states to its Super Tuesday roster, naming this subset the SEC primary in a nod to the Southeastern Conference of college sports. Clinton demonstrated her pull with black voters in South Carolina, suggesting she may do well in other Southern states with significant black populations.
The biggest Super Tuesday state overall is Texas, where Sen. Cruz has a home-state advantage built on prime endorsements from the governor down the political chain and a veritable army of some 27,000 volunteers.
Everything in politics is double-edged, though.
If Trump's rebel yell attracts enough support to make him the winner or even a close second, Cruz will face sharp questions about his viability.
___
THE LINEUP
Both parties are holding contests Tuesday in these states: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.
As well, Republicans vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad.
In the 12 states holding contests, polls close at 7 p.m. EST in three (Virginia, Georgia and Vermont), and at 8 p.m. EST in four more (Oklahoma, Alabama, Tennessee and Massachusetts). The rest, Eastern time: 8:30 p.m. in Arkansas, 9 p.m. in Texas, Colorado and Minnesota; and midnight in Alaska."
"Before Trump, there was Jesse Ventura _ and a big victory",http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--GOP%202016-Trump-Ventura/id-6c4aca1ba75c4b04ab94a0bdd77883f0,ap,3/1/2016 14:23:15,,"He was a candidate few thought stood a chance. Best known as a television showman, he seemed more interested in self-promotion than winning public office. But soon he was dominating media coverage and debate stages, each pungent remark only endearing him more to a disenchanted public.
Then Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura became governor of Minnesota.
Well before Donald Trump shook up the race for the Republican presidential nomination, there was Ventura, the former professional wrestler, radio talk show host and suburban mayor who  in his own election-night words  ""shocked the world"" with his improbable 1998 victory.
As Trump looks to expand his delegate lead in Super Tuesday contests and further show that he's for real, the similarities between his campaign and Ventura's continue to grow. The billionaire businessman enters the biggest day of the race so far with several wins under his belt and exuding confidence about his chances in the contests across the Deep South. His top rivals, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are struggling to contain him.
""Jesse's success is the perfect case history to show this can happen,"" said Bill Hillsman, a Minneapolis ad man and close Ventura adviser who came up with several memorable campaign ads, including one that depicted Ventura as an action figure who tells special interests: ""I don't want your stupid money.""
""Donald Trump's campaign is just Jesse's campaign writ very large, with more money and some hugely advantageous communications tools"" such as social media and online organizing, Hillsman said.
There are differences, of course, particularly on social issues. Trump has proposed expanding the border wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico and has rejected gay marriage. Ventura has supported open borders and said during a 1998 debate that government shouldn't be involved in who may marry.
Ventura also was a Reform Party candidate who blasted Republicans and Democrats as ""rival gangs,"" while Trump is seeking the GOP nomination.
But voters see Trump as sufficiently untethered from the party. Both Trump and Ventura are brash and loose with words, much in contrast to the more scripted traditional candidates.
That was enough to draw Darren Anderson to the polls in 1998, when at age 25 he was one of many first-time voters who helped Ventura win. Anderson, now 43, recalls watching a debate between ""Jesse,"" Democrat Skip Humphrey and Republican Norm Coleman. Ventura was the only one who ""called a spade a spade.""
""He wasn't your standard politician and he wasn't blowing smoke.""
That's also why the teacher from New Ulm, Minnesota, is now leaning toward Trump in Minnesota's vote Tuesday. While in the back of his mind he worries a Trump presidency could ""go really wrong,"" he says the GOP front runner ""is saying things the country wants to hear.""
Both Ventura and Trump drew some of their strongest support from blue collar voters who dislike the political establishment.
But Ventura's typical voter was younger, largely male and ""for the most part regarded the election as a giant kegger,"" said St. Cloud State University political science professor Stephen Frank, who co-wrote a book on Ventura's election.
Ventura appealed to them as much for his personality as for his promises to cut taxes amid a budget surplus. Coleman, a former St. Paul mayor, and Humphrey, the son of former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, focused on each other during debates, ignoring Ventura.
Ventura told XXX Monday he sees echoes of his campaign in Trump's. But he's split between supporting Trump or Sen. Bernie Sanders, who's vying for the Democratic nomination. He's also considering his own bid as a third-party Libertarian candidate.
Dane Smith, who spent 30 years as a reporter in St. Paul and Minneapolis and covered Ventura, recalls a ""Trump-like"" feeling in the governor's race when polls showed Ventura running surprisingly strong.
""You were saying to yourself 'Holy cow. This guy isn't going to collapse,' "" Smith said.
Even Ventura needed some convincing on election night. After the first TV station called the race saying he'd won, the governor-elect told his team he wanted to wait for more results before making his victory speech.
Ventura had a mixed record as governor. After campaigning on a tax cut, Ventura refunded part of a state surplus to taxpayers  payments he dubbed ""Jesse checks."" He oversaw building of the Twin Cities' light rail and provided more money for schools.
But he also butted heads with lawmakers and seemed to tire of the day-to-day slog of government. Toward the end of his first term he said he wouldn't seek another.
""There's no consensus whether he was a bad governor or an average governor,"" Smith said. ""There is sort of a consensus he was far too egotistical and self-centered, that the whole purpose was to serve his own fame and fortune.""
Still, Minnesota voters like Anderson say if there's a lesson for 2016, it's to take Trump seriously.
""So many people took it as a joke, a big public joke,"" Anderson said. ""And then they win.""

Ben Carson says 'no path forward' in his bid for White House,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US-GOP-2016-Carson/id-a433cde934924b24b4e3999ef41e8edf,ap,3/2/2016 20:49:56,,"Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said he is effectively ending his bid for the White House Wednesday, concluding a roller-coaster campaign that briefly took him to the top of a chaotic GOP field but ended with a Super Tuesday whimper.
""I do not see a political path forward,"" Carson said in a statement posted on his campaign website, though he added, ""I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America"" and promised to offer details of his future when he speaks Friday at a conservative conference in Washington.
He did not explicitly say that he's ending his campaign, only noting that he does not plan to take part in Thursday's Fox News debate. But his longtime businessman and friend, Armstrong Williams, confirmed that the soft-spoken candidate would no longer be asking for votes.
""There's only one candidate in this 2016 election on the GOP side, and his name is Trump. That's the reality,"" Williams said, adding that Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz also should drop out, as they ""also have no path"" to the nomination.
Carson's exit reduces the active Republican field to four candidates, though billionaire Donald Trump remains the clear leader in earned delegates and voter preference polls.
Carson, 64, was one of several anti-establishment candidates who shaped the early stages of a Republican race defined by conservatives' wide-ranging disgust with the nation's direction and GOP leaders' perceived inability to alter it.
He ran as an outsider, offering a poverty-to-fame autobiography, his unabashed Christian faith and an unceasing indictment of conventional politics, styling his bid as an effort to combat ""political correctness"" and what he described as a creep toward ""socialism.""
That formula fueled a steady climb in the polls and a powerful fundraising effort. But his success also brought intense scrutiny. Carson lashed out publicly at questions about his life story, having to explain anecdotes like his claim to have been offered a ""scholarship"" to West Point. He made foreign policy flubs, from a mistaken suggestion that China is militarily involved in Syria's civil war, to a high profile speech in which he repeatedly mispronounced the name of the Palestinian political and military organization Hamas.
And he endured public sniping among some of his closest advisers, some of whom contributed to questions about his overall fitness for the job.
The only African-American among the presidential contenders of either major party, Carson announced his bid in May from his native Detroit, where he was raised in a poor neighborhood by a single mother. Though she could not read, Carson said, his mother saw to it that he and his brother received formal educations.
Carson attended Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School. He earned national acclaim during 29 years leading the pediatric neurosurgery unit of Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. He directed the first surgery to separate twins connected at the back of the head. His career was notable enough to inspire the 2009 movie, ""Gifted Hands,"" with actor Cuba Gooding Jr. depicting Carson.
He rose to political prominence with his address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, where he offered a withering critique of the modern welfare state and the nation's overall direction. The speech restated themes from Carson's 2012 book ""America the Beautiful,"" but he excited conservatives by doing so with President Barack Obama sitting just feet away.
He would often tell voters that he viewed his candidacy as a way to honor the American founders' view of the ""citizen-statesman.""
""If I am successful in this endeavor,"" he said Dec. 8 in Georgia, ""then a lot of other people who are not career politicians but who are very smart will start thinking, maybe I can do that, too, and we will expand the pool from which we selected our leadership.""

"Christie's shell-shocked look stirs mockery, befuddlement",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-03-02-US-GOP-2016-Christie-Under-Fire/id-7bc449cc8f0d4503bc23b5fb51becafb,ap,3/2/2016 20:29:11,," (AP)  Was that really Chris Christie, the brusque, take-a-back-seat-to-no-one governor of New Jersey?
Christie's seemingly shell-shocked gaze as he stood behind Donald Trump on Super Tuesday is generating befuddlement and mockery in his home state and beyond.
Conservatives and liberals alike have piled on.
His introductory remarks were so subdued and his appearance was so grave that many people joked on the Internet that he looked like a hostage reading a coerced statement. ""Gov. Christie, blink twice if you're in trouble!"" one person tweeted.
In a move that shocked nearly everyone, especially in Democratic-leaning New Jersey, Christie endorsed Trump last week and has appeared at the billionaire businessman's side at campaign appearances over the past few days.
But after Tuesday night's appearance, conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg of the anti-Trump National Review imagined Christie was thinking: ""My God what have I done?"" Others saw the same thing in Christie's blank stare and robotic words of introduction.
Aside from Tuesday night, Christie appears to be fully embracing his surrogate duties. The governor has introduced Trump at a number of enthusiastic rallies and has been Trump's attack dog, sinking his teeth into Sen. Marco Rubio and vouching for Trump and his family.
Back home, the reaction has been fierce.
Republican Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and Environmental Protection Agency administrator, told The Star-Ledger of Newark last week she would rather vote for Hillary Clinton than Trump.
""I am ashamed that Christie would endorse anyone who has employed the kind of hate mongering and racism that Trump has,"" she said.
Six Gannett newspapers in New Jersey, including the Asbury Park Press, said he isn't fit to be governor any more. They called him a political opportunist who has neglected his duties in the Garden State, and urged him to resign.
A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll saw Christie's approval ratings fall from 33 percent before he backed Trump to 27 percent since. The poll sampled 694 registered New Jersey voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.
""Trump and Christie kind of do belong together, but not running our country,"" said Barbara Silverstein of Gibbsboro, New Jersey. ""It's a big show, and it's pretty pathetic.""
In the past few days, the politician with the outsized personality seemed to be shrinking in political stature even if something big  perhaps the No. 2 spot on the ballot with Trump  is his goal.
Trump was heard on a microphone telling Christie to get on a plane and go home after Christie was pressed Sunday in an ABC interview about his disagreement with Trump on his proposed ban on Muslims.
Christie refers to the candidate, who is supposedly his longtime friend, as ""Mr. Trump,"" while Trump refers to the governor as ""Chris.""
Christie defended his endorsement this week on his regular radio call-in show.
""I've known him personally for 14 years and I believe he is the best person to beat Hillary Clinton,"" the governor said, before clarifying that he, Christie, was the best candidate but that Trump is the best of the remaining contenders.
Christie wouldn't discuss on the call-in show whether he was hoping for a vice presidential or Cabinet slot.
Asked about his previous criticisms of Trump, Christie said that was a natural part of having to run against him  no different, he said, from George H.W. Bush calling Ronald Reagan's policies ""voodoo economics"" before becoming his vice presidential pick.
To Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Harrison, Christie's seeming thousand-yard stare seemed to reflect sadness.
""It really looked like heartbreak and kind of a bitter pill that he was swallowing,"" she said. ""I still think that in his heart of hearts he thinks he was destined to be president of the United States."""

Footage of Christie's stunned look, set to the jaunty theme song from HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" became a sensation online Wednesday. And Washington Post blogger Alexandra Petri wrote an extended riff about how Christie was ""screaming wordlessly"" as Trump spoke and had ""the glazed and terrified look of someone who has traded his inheritance for no pottage at all.""
Christie's office declined to comment on his appearance.

Trump was heard on a microphone telling Christie to get on a plane and go home this weekend, and Christie was pressed Sunday in an ABC interview about his disagreement with Trump on his proposed ban on Muslims.
Christie refers to the candidate, who is supposedly his longtime friend, as ""Mr. Trump,"" while Trump refers to the governor as ""Chris.""
Christie defended his endorsement this week on his regular radio call-in show.
""I've known him personally for 14 years and I believe he is the best person to beat Hillary Clinton,"" the governor said, before clarifying that he, Christie, was the best candidate but that Trump is the best of the remaining contenders.
Christie wouldn't discuss on the call-in show whether he was hoping for a vice presidential or Cabinet slot.
Asked about his previous criticisms of Trump, Christie said that was a natural part of having to run against him  no different, he said, from George H.W. Bush calling Ronald Reagan's policies ""voodoo economics"" before becoming his vice presidential pick.
To Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Harrison, Christie's far-off stare seemed to reflect sadness.
""It really looked like heartbreak and kind of a bitter pill that he was swallowing,"" she said. ""I still think that in his heart of hearts he thinks he was destined to be president of the United States.""

This story has been corrected to show that Trump was heard telling Christie to get on a plane and go home before the interview with ABC, not after.

Clinton looking to pull away in Democratic primaries,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-ELECTION-DEM/id-98833fbd4b8d40ac8b9420daa8198a99,ap,3/1/2016 18:29:22,,"Hillary Clinton enters a series of Super Tuesday contests poised to extend her lead over Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who risks a major setback for his insurgent campaign with a poor showing in primaries and caucuses across the nation.
Backed by black voters, Clinton aimed for a sweep of Southern states holding primaries on Tuesday and polls showed her with a big advantage in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Sanders could only bank on winning his home state of Vermont and both campaigns were vying for support in Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Virginia.
""I am confident that if there is a large voter turnout today across this country we are going to do well,"" Sanders said after voting in his home state of Vermont. He joked, ""After a lot of deliberation, I know that Bernie Sanders, here in Vermont, got at least one vote. I was working on my wife, so I probably got two.""
All told, Clinton and Sanders were competing for 865 delegates in 11 states and American Samoa on Tuesday, the biggest single-day prize of the 2016 campaign. Black voters powered Clinton to victory in South Carolina last weekend, with 8 in 10 voting for her, and were expected to give her a huge advantage throughout the South.
Clinton starts Tuesday with 546 delegates, including super delegates  the party leaders and members of Congress who can support any candidate. Sanders has 87 delegates and needs to begin winning states with a healthy margin to gain ground on Clinton. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.
Clinton was making a quick jaunt into Minnesota and then joining with supporters in Miami, a destination that foreshadows the importance of Florida as a general election battleground. She has already turned her attention to Republican front-runner Donald Trump, arguing that she would be the best candidate to help Democrats hold onto the White House after President Barack Obama's two terms.
Sanders decamped to his home in Burlington, Vermont, where he planned to watch the returns with his home state's faithful. At rallies in Minnesota and Massachusetts on Monday, Sanders vowed to fight on until the party's convention in July and his advisers pointed to a calendar that would be more accommodating later this month.
Asked by reporters in Boston if he would hurt the party's chances if he carried on, Sanders said only 15 states will have voted by Tuesday and it was ""more than appropriate"" to let people ""vote for the candidate of their choice.""
But the map, at least on Tuesday, did not appear to be helping Sanders. Because Democrats award their delegates proportionally, Clinton could use blowout victories in the South to add to her delegate haul.
Sanders was expected to win handily in Vermont but the other states where he was competing  Minnesota, Massachusetts and Oklahoma  were expected to be narrowly contested, making it unlikely he will cut into Clinton's advantage.
Despite his obstacles, the Vermont senator has little incentive to fold. He reported raising more than $42 million in February, a sign that he will have the money to go deep into the spring. And his team views a series of caucuses in Nebraska and Kansas and Michigan's primary later this month as places where he could regain some momentum.
Super Tuesday has been pivotal for the Clintons before. Then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton used a sweep of Southern states in March 1992 to establish himself as the front-runner for the party's nomination, setting him on a course for the White House."

"Clinton, Trump cemented as 2016 leaders; GOP desperate",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US-Campaign-2016/id-5d70d1e3ef184635897074c7c264915b,ap,3/2/2016 13:59:55,,"Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump seized decisive Super Tuesday victories with math and momentum on their side, leaving rivals scrambling for last-chance, long-shot strategies. For the Republican establishment, the search was increasingly dire.
Trump's seven victories in states across the country amounted to a GOP establishment collapse with no clear sign of rapid recovery. While his rivals promised to fight on, the party remained deeply divided over the preferred Trump alternative. Marco Rubio won only liberal Minnesota. Sen. Ted Cruz took his home state of Texas, neighboring Oklahoma and Alaska.
Clinton also won seven of the nearly a dozen states that weighed in Tuesday. Rival Bernie Sanders won his home state of Vermont, as well as Minnesota, Oklahoma and Colorado.
In his victory speech, Trump sent a chilling warning to the GOP establishment. A moment after Trump professed to have good relationships with his party's elite, he issued a warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had declared earlier Tuesday that ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices."" Trump said that if the two don't get along, Ryan is ""going to have to pay a big price.""
Clinton, meanwhile, called for ""love and kindness""  a contrast to hard-edge Trump  while her rival Bernie Sanders promised to fight on to the convention.
Both victors spoke from Florida, which did not vote on Tuesday, but where the general election is often won or lost.
Both Rubio and Cruz said they would fight on.
""Our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz thundered to supporters gathered at the wood-paneled Redneck Country Club in Stafford, Texas.
Still, he'd been counting on more appeal in the Southern states and among evangelical Christian voters. Trump, who dubs his surging campaign the ""Trump Train,"" has derailed those plans.
Rubio and the other Republicans still in the race, John Kasich and Ben Carson, struggled Tuesday to convey optimism even as they vowed to fight on.
Simple math reinforces a bind for the Republicans who reject Trump, as the brash billionaire businessman carried seven states and continues to barrel toward the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the GOP nomination.
Trump won at least 203 delegates Tuesday. Cruz collected at least 144 delegates and Rubio picked up at least 71. Overall, Trump leads with 285 delegates, Cruz has 161, Rubio has 87, Kasich has 25 and Carson has eight. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination.
Increasingly, leading Republicans talk of a contested convention in July as their best remaining option for stopping Trump, whose divisive rhetoric about immigrants and ethnic and religious groups has some fearing a GOP wipeout in November.
Sanders assured supporters he'd take his fight to ""every one"" of the remaining contests. With a staggering $42 million raised in February alone, Sanders has the campaign cash to do just that though Clinton is well on her way to the 2,383 delegates needed on the Democratic side.
Clinton collected wins in seven states, and Trump swept up victories in seven, including Virginia, another important general election battleground.
She is assured of winning at least 457 of the 865 delegates at stake Tuesday. Sanders gains at least 286. When including party leaders, Clinton has at least 1,005 delegates and Sanders has at least 373.
Clinton held on to older voters and strongly prevailed among Hispanics and African-Americans, according to exit polls conducted for XXX and television networks by Edison Research. Trump, a political newcomer, pulled in two-thirds of voters looking to install an outsider in the White House, while GOP voters seeking an experienced candidate were split between Rubio and Cruz, both first-term senators.
Speaking from his gold-flecked Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump asserted that his candidacy is a ""movement"" and he claimed he would unify the party was by training his fire on Clinton.
He said she should be disqualified from even running for office because she broke from government protocol by using a private email server while she was secretary of state.
Clinton tried to turn Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan on its head, saying the country instead must be made ""whole again.""
""What we need in America today is more love and kindness,"" she said. ""Instead of building walls, we're going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment.""
Trump ridiculed her comments. ""She's been there for so long,"" he said. ""If she hasn't straightened it out by now, she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years.""
Rubio said his supporters would never rally around Trump. He and Kasich showed little sign of relenting, especially with their home states of Florida and Ohio voting on March 15.
""We are so excited about what lies ahead for our campaign,"" Rubio said at his Tuesday night rally in Miami, his hometown. ""You see, just five days ago we began to unmask the true nature of the front-runner in this race.""
He portrayed his attacks on Trump as having an impact already, though that wasn't evident in Super Tuesday's results.
""Two weeks from tonight right here in Florida,"" Rubio said, ""we are going to send a message loud and clear: The party of Lincoln and Reagan will never be held by a con artist."""

Clinton also carried Texas, the night's biggest prize.
On the Republican side, Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas, as well as neighboring Oklahoma. Democrat Bernie Sanders picked up a home-state win as well, in Vermont, and won in Oklahoma, too.
Still, the night belonged to Trump and Clinton, who turned the busiest day of the 2016 primaries into a showcase of their strength with a wide swath of American voters.
""What a Super Tuesday,"" Clinton exclaimed during a victory rally.
As Trump's victories piled up, he fired off ""thank you"" Twitter notes to the states that landed in his win column. The billionaire businessman scheduled a nighttime news conference at his swanky Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, eschewing the traditional election night rally.
Cruz desperately needed a win in Texas in order to stay in the race, and was likely to keep campaigning as the only Republican who has been able to defeat Trump in any primary contest.
For Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the night was turning into a disappointment. While a flood of Republican officeholders have rallied around him in recent days, his first victory remained elusive as results rolled in.
Still, Rubio, who has launched an aggressive campaign to stop Trump in recent days, vowed to keep up his efforts to ""unmask the true nature of the front-runner in this race.""
The Florida senator's long-shot White House hopes now rest with his home state, which votes on March 15. But he's expected to face fresh calls from Trump and others to drop out of the race before then.
""He has to get out,"" Trump told Fox News earlier in the day. ""He hasn't won anything.""
Super Tuesday marked the busiest day of the 2016 primaries, with the biggest single-day delegate haul up for grabs. Democrats voted in 11 states and American Samoa, with 865 delegates at stake. Republicans voted in 11 states, with 595 delegates.
Clinton also picked up wins in Alabama and Arkansas, while Trump carried the GOP contests in Alabama and Massachusetts.
Clinton steadied herself after an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sanders. The Vermont senator did carry his home state decisively, and told the crowd at a raucous victory party that he was ""so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country.""
Exit polls underscored Sanders' continued weakness with black voters, a core part of the Democratic constituency. Clinton led with African-Americans, as well as both men and women, in Georgia and Virginia, according to surveys conducted by Edison Research for XXX and television networks.
Sanders continued to show strength with young voters, carrying the majority of those under the age of 30.
The contests come at a turbulent time for the GOP, given Trump's strengths in the face of opposition from many party leaders. Some in the party establishment fear the anti-Trump campaign has come too late.
Trump's wins in the South were a blow to Cruz, who once saw the region as his opportunity to stake a claim to the nomination.
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Instead, he's appeared to only grow stronger, winning states and drawing broad support for some of his most controversial proposals.
In six of the states on Tuesday, large majorities of Republican voters said they supported a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States, an idea championed by Trump. Two-thirds of GOP voters in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, 7 in 10 in Tennessee, and nearly 8 in 10 in Alabama supported the proposal, according to the early exit polls.
Worries among Republicans appeared to grow after Trump briefly refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke during a television interview. Trump later said he had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and he did repudiate him.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that anyone who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee must reject any racist group or individual.
States holding voting contests in both parties were Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Republicans also vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad."

Super Tuesday marked the busiest day of the 2016 primaries, with the biggest single-day delegate haul up for grabs. With elections in every region of the country, the contests put a spotlight on candidates' strengths and weaknesses with a broad swath of American voters.
For Clinton and Trump, the voting marked an opportunity to begin pulling away from their rivals and charting a course toward the general election. Each entered Super Tuesday having won three of four early voting contests, and more strong showings could start putting the nominations out of reach for other contenders.
Seconds after polls closed in Georgia, a confident Trump wrote on Twitter, ""Thank you Georgia!""
Sanders, who has mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge to Clinton in the Democratic race, was greeted enthusiastically during a victory rally in Vermont. He said that while he wants to win in every part of the country, it was particularly meaningful that his home state ""voted so strongly to put us in the White House.""

Cruz once saw the Southern states that voted Tuesday as his opportunity to stake his claim to the nomination. Now his campaign's future hinges on a victory in his home state of Texas, the biggest prize of the day.
Rubio's goal was even more modest. He was seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count and hoping to pull off a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.
Even before the first results started flowing in, Trump was calling on Rubio to give up if he didn't win anywhere on Tuesday.
""He has to get out,"" he told Fox News. ""He hasn't won anything.""

The disarray among Republicans comes as Clinton appears to be tightening her grip on the Democratic field. Her wins in Georgia and Virginia were the first of what her campaign hoped would be a sweep of the South, a region where large segments of the Democratic electorate are black.
In Georgia, just under half of Democratic voters on Tuesday were black, with 8 in 10 backing Clinton. About a quarter of Virginia's Democratic voters were black, and also overwhelmingly backed Clinton, according to exit polling.
Democratic voters were more likely to want a continuation of Obama's policies than switch to more liberal policies in eight of nine states where surveys were conducted.
Signaling her growing confidence, Clinton has increasingly turned her attention to Trump in recent days, casting herself as a civil alternative to the insults and bullying that have consumed the Republican race.
""What we can't let happen is the scapegoating, the flaming, the finger pointing that is going on the Republican side,"" she told voters in Springfield, Massachusetts. ""It really undermines our fabric as a nation.""
States holding voting contests in both parties were Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Republicans also vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad."

Republican races in those states were too close to call as polls closed.
Super Tuesday marked the busiest day of the 2016 primaries, with the biggest single-day delegate haul up for grabs. With elections in every region of the country, the contests put a spotlight on candidates' strengths and weaknesses with a broad swath of American voters.
For Clinton, as well as Republican front-runner Donald Trump, the voting marked an opportunity to begin pulling away from their rivals and charting a course toward the general election. Each entered Super Tuesday having won three of four early voting contests, and more strong showings could start putting the nominations out of reach for other contenders.
Clinton led in both Virginia and Georgia among both men and women, as well as black voters. Sanders continued to show strength with young voters, carrying the majority of those under the age of 30, according to early exit polls conducted by Edison Research for XXX and television networks.
Democrats were voting in 11 states and American Samoa on, with 865 delegates up for grabs. Republicans were voting in 11 states, with 595 delegates at stake.
The contests come at a turbulent time for the GOP, given Trump's strengths in the face of opposition from many party leaders. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz launched furious verbal attacks on the billionaire businessman in recent days, but some in the party establishment fear the anti-Trump campaign has come too late.
Cruz once saw the Southern states that voted Tuesday as his opportunity to stake his claim to the nomination. Now his campaign's future hinges on a victory in his home state of Texas, the biggest prize of the day.
Rubio's goal was even more modest. He was seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count and hoping to pull off a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.
Even before the first results started flowing in, Trump was calling on Rubio to give up if he didn't win anywhere on Tuesday.
""He has to get out,"" he told Fox News. ""He hasn't won anything.""
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Instead, he's appeared to only grow stronger, winning states and drawing broad support for some of his most controversial proposals.
In six of the states on Tuesday, large majorities of Republican voters said they supported a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States, an idea championed by Trump. Two-thirds of GOP voters in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, 7 in 10 in Tennessee, and nearly 8 in 10 in Alabama supported the proposal, according to the early exit polls.
Worries among Republicans appeared to grow after Trump briefly refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke during a television interview. Trump later said he had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and he did repudiate him.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that anyone who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee must reject any racist group or individual.
""When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up. So today I want to be very clear about something: If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games,"" Ryan said.

Those more interested in a candidate with political experience? They split about evenly between first-term senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, according to early results of exit polls conducted for XXX and television networks by Edison Research.

PORTRAIT OF  A TRUMP VOTER
Nine in 10 of Trump's voters are looking for an outsider. Half are angry with the government. Nearly as many want a candidate willing to ""tell it like it is."" Four in 10 said they were born again, cutting into Ted Cruz's efforts to claim the evangelical vote. Trump, who has professed mutual admiration with ""poorly educated voters,"" was favored by half of voters without a college degree. His followers are nothing if not loyal: Six in 10 of his voters made up their minds more than a month ago.
___
PORTRAIT OF CLINTON VOTER
More than 90 percent of Clinton's voters want an insider, and nearly half say experience is the quality they are looking for in a candidate.

GOP leaders: No place for bigotry in the Republican Party,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US-GOP-2016-Congress/id-12affb327f464d799c707102e583aad3,ap,3/1/2016 20:21:46,,"The two top Republican leaders in Congress denounced Donald Trump on Tuesday for his slow-moving disavowal of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted Trump's ""seeming ambivalence about David Duke and the KKK"" as Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned that anyone who wants the Republican president nomination must reject racism.
The rebuke of Trump came as GOP voters went to the polls in 11 states in a ""Super Tuesday"" of balloting that many Republicans fear could give the combative and controversial New Yorker unstoppable momentum toward claiming the GOP presidential nod.
""This party does not prey on people's prejudices. We appeal to their highest ideals. This is the Party of Lincoln,"" Ryan told reporters as voters in 11 states holding GOP contests headed to the polls on Super Tuesday.
At the same time, Ryan reiterated that he will support the eventual GOP presidential nominee.
Never mentioning Trump's name, Ryan and McConnell were clearly referring to the billionaire businessman's appearance Sunday on CNN when he declined to disavow the support of Duke and other white supremacists.
""Let me make it perfectly clear: Senate Republicans condemn David Duke, the KKK, and his racism,"" McConnell said.
""When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up. So today I want to be very clear about something: If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry,"" Ryan said.
Last year, Ryan and McConnell disavowed Trump's plan to block Muslims from entering the U.S. Otherwise, they've tried to stay clear of commenting on the race.
Trump subsequently disavowed Duke, blaming his interview performance Sunday on a bad earpiece.
His two top rivals  Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas  criticized Trump and said the GOP must condemn white supremacists.
But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi argued that ""Trump's radical agenda"" reflects the House Republican conference. Pelosi said that while some in the GOP are distancing themselves from Trump, Republicans refused to remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds and have blocked renewal of the Voting Rights Act.
""The reality is, Donald Trump is just being more candid about the agenda of discrimination House Republicans have been advancing for years,"" Pelosi said in a statement.
Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada noted that both GOP leaders say they expect to support the eventual nominee.
""Republicans say they they'll support a man who refuses to denounce the KKK so until they withdraw their support, talk is really cheap,"" Reid said.
On Tuesday, USA Today reported that a group of about 30 African-American students from Valdosta State University were kicked out of a Trump rally by law enforcement officials.
""The only reason we were given was that Mr. Trump did not want us there,"" 22-year-old senior Brooke Gladney told the newspaper. The campaign denied any role in their ouster from the event.
Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice presidential nominee, bemoaned the current discourse in the GOP and said it was time to get back to focusing on how Republicans would solve the nation's problems.
""We believe all people are created in the eyes of God and our government. This is fundamental. And if someone wants to be our nominee they must understand this,"" said the Wisconsin congressman.
He said he has tried to avoid commenting on the presidential race but felt a need to speak up.
""I try to stay out of the day-to-day ups and downs of the primary,"" Ryan said. ""But I've said when I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up.""
Many Washington Republicans are increasingly open about their dismay at the prospect of Trump winning the GOP nomination. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., an advocate of updating U.S. immigration law, said the prospect of voting for Trump is ""not a pleasant thought at all .... I'm still holding out hope we don't have that choice.""
Last month, Trump took a swipe at Ryan, saying the GOP lost the White House in 2012 because the vice presidential candidate was synonymous with a budget that targeted Social Security. That, according to Trump, cost Republicans with seniors.
Ryan rejected that argument on Tuesday, saying he and Mitt Romney won the senior vote by 12 percentage points, ""the best performance a Republican ticket has had since 1984 when Ronald Reagan had a landslide election."""
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump cemented as 2016 leaders,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US--Campaign%202016/id-8cd33d9a3bfe400ea1c08f8eae645120,ap,3/2/2016 8:59:18,,"Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, emboldened by commanding victories Tuesday across large swaths of the country, are beginning to focus on each other in the race for the White House.
Clinton previewed a ""love and kindness"" message while Trump traded his typical rollicking rallies for a sober media conference where he pressed his case that Clinton is a proven failure as a longtime politician.
Both spoke from Florida, where the general election is often won or lost. That wasn't one of the dozen states that weighed in on a day known as Super Tuesday because it's the busiest of the 2016 primary season.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz won his home state and Oklahoma, buttressing his out-of-the-gate win in the Iowa caucuses a month ago, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio notched his first victory, in Minnesota.
""Our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat, and that will beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz thundered to supporters gathered at the wood-paneled Redneck Country Club in Stafford, Texas.
Still, he'd been counting on more appeal in the Southern states and among evangelical Christian voters. Trump, who dubs his surging campaign the ""Trump Train,"" has derailed those plans.
Rubio and the other Republicans still in the race, John Kasich and Ben Carson, struggled Tuesday to convey optimism even as they vowed to fight on.
Simple math reinforces a bind for the Republicans who reject Trump, as the brash billionaire businessman continues to barrel toward the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the GOP nomination.
Trump won at least 192 delegates Tuesday. Cruz collected at least 132 delegates and Rubio picked up at least 66. Overall, Trump leads with 274 delegates, Cruz has 149, Rubio has 82, Kasich has 25 and Carson has eight. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination.
Increasingly, leading Republicans talk of a contested convention in July as their best remaining option for stopping Trump, whose divisive rhetoric about immigrants and ethnic and religious groups has some fearing a GOP wipeout in November.
Like Cruz, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was victorious in his home state.
He also picked up victories in Oklahoma, Minnesota and Colorado, and he assured supporters he'd take his fight to ""every one"" of the remaining contests. With a staggering $42 million raised in February alone, Sanders has the campaign cash to do just that  though Clinton is well on her way to the 2,383 delegates needed on the Democratic side.
Tuesday's results left little doubt as to the front-runners in the race.
Clinton collected wins in eight states, and Trump swept up victories in at least seven, including Virginia, another important general election battleground.
She is assured of winning at least 457 of the 865 delegates at stake Tuesday. Sanders will gain at least 286. When including party leaders, Clinton has at least 1,005 delegates and Sanders has at least 373.
Clinton held on to older voters and strongly prevailed among Hispanics and African-Americans, according to exit polls conducted for XXX and television networks by Edison Research. Trump, a political newcomer, pulled in two-thirds of voters looking to install an outsider in the White House, while GOP voters seeking an experienced candidate were split between Rubio and Cruz, both first-term senators.
Speaking from his gold-flecked Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump asserted that his candidacy is a ""movement"" and that he is expanding the Republican Party even as many of its leaders have distanced themselves from him.
A moment after Trump professed to have good relationships with his party's elite, he issued a warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had declared earlier Tuesday that ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices."" Trump said that if the two don't get along, Ryan is ""going to have to pay a big price.""
One way Trump claimed he would unify the party was by training his fire on Clinton.
He said she should be disqualified from even running for office because she broke from government protocol by using a private email server while she was secretary of state.
Clinton tried to turn Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan on its head, saying the country instead must be made ""whole again.""
""What we need in America today is more love and kindness,"" she said. ""Instead of building walls, we're going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment.""
Trump ridiculed her comments. ""She's been there for so long,"" he said. ""If she hasn't straightened it out by now, she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years.""
Rubio said his supporters would never rally around Trump. He and Kasich showed little sign of relenting, especially with their home states of Florida and Ohio voting on March 15.
""We are so excited about what lies ahead for our campaign,"" Rubio said at his Tuesday night rally in Miami, his hometown. ""You see, just five days ago we began to unmask the true nature of the front-runner in this race.""
He portrayed his attacks on Trump as having an impact already, though that wasn't evident in Super Tuesday's results.
""Two weeks from tonight right here in Florida,"" Rubio said, ""we are going to send a message loud and clear: The party of Lincoln and Reagan will never be held by a con artist."""
How to stop Trump? GOP leaders search for a way,http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US--Campaign%202016/id-f28e9d873d36473fb9833c3c43eedded,ap,3/2/2016 19:58:33,,"Gripped by chaos and dismay, Republican leaders searched on Wednesday for a last-chance option to derail Donald Trump's momentum fueled by seven commanding Super Tuesday victories.
Overshadowed by Trump's wins, Ted Cruz came in a close second in the night's delegate haul, thanks to a win in his home state of Texas. The strong showing bolstered the senator's case to be the party's Trump alternative, even as rival Marco Rubio vowed to continue his fight.
The unrelenting division represented the biggest crisis for the GOP in decades, with the party seemingly on track to nominate a presidential candidate it can't contain. Some party leaders are considering the once unthinkable option of aligning behind Cruz, whom many dislike, while others are talking of a brokered convention. Some influential outsiders even raise the option of forming a new party.
Though convention fights are much more talked about than actually occur, an Associated Press delegate count indicates Trump will have to do better in upcoming contests to claim the nomination before the party's national gathering in July. So far, he has won 46 percent of the delegates awarded, and he would have to increase that to 52 percent in the remaining primaries.
The GOP mayhem contrasts sharply with the increasing cohesion on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton locked down solid victories in seven states and was on the path to regaining her status as the inevitable nominee. Clinton's dominance with black voters carried her to wins across the South. Still, Bernie Sanders picked up wins in his home state of Vermont as well as Minnesota, Oklahoma and Colorado, and he said he would fight on.
The Democratic drama paled in comparison to the existential questions Republicans wrestled with in the wake of the most significant election night of the primary. Trump won handily in states as politically opposite as Massachusetts and Alabama, a sign of his broad, outsider appeal and energizing impact on voter turnout.
Along with Texas, Cruz took neighboring Oklahoma and also Alaska. Florida Rubio won only liberal Minnesota.
Despite Trump's commanding victories, many Republican leaders remained deeply skeptical he could beat Clinton in a head-to-head matchup in November and some questioned whether they'd want him in the White House if he did. They turned to the sort of ""break glass"" options once thought impossible.
""Ted Cruz is not my favorite by any means,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former candidate whose disdain for his Texas colleague is well known, told CBS News. ""But we may be in a position where rallying around Ted Cruz is the only way to stop Donald Trump and I'm not so sure that would work.""
Still, Graham also cast doubt on whether elder GOP statesmen could wrest hold of the situation.
""At what point do you realize the Republican Party is unorganized -- like the Democratic Party? There's no secret group of people,"" he scoffed.
The comments came as #NeverTrump hashtag spread across Twitter and an anti-Trump Super Pac released a new online video and said it would increase its daily attacks ahead of primaries on March 8 and March 15. Our Principles PAC latest attack blasts Trump for not clearly repudiating David Duke, a onetime KKK member who endorsed Trump's campaign.
Other prominent Republicans called for more drastic measures.
""It may be necessary for men and women of principle within the party to set the self-detonation sequence as they escape the ship to a new party,"" wrote conservative blogger Erick Erickson. Erickson was among those calling on the party to coalesce around Cruz.
In his victory speech, Trump sent a clear message to the GOP establishment, warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had declared earlier Tuesday that ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices,"" that if the two don't get along, Ryan is ""going to have to pay a big price.""
Delegate math would seem to underscore the problem for Republicans who reject Trump.
For the night, Trump won at least 234 delegates and Cruz won at least 209. Rubio was a distant third with at least 90. There were still 40 delegates left to be allocated.
Overall, Trump leads with 316 delegates and Cruz has 226. Rubio has 106, John Kasich has 25 and Ben Carson eight.
The math was also tough for Sanders. Clinton was assured of winning at least 457 of the 865 delegates at stake Tuesday. Sanders gained at least 286. When including party leaders, Clinton has at least 1,005 delegates and Sanders has at least 373. It takes 2,383 to win the nomination.
Top Sanders advisers argue that Super Tuesday was the best day on the primary calendar for Clinton. But the map will get more difficult for her moving forward, said Sanders senior adviser Tad Devine."
It's a Super Tuesday for Clinton and Trump,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election%20Rdp/id-14ee33dd0b1042b1b473d1bd22ae0184,ap,3/2/2016 4:47:59,,"Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton swept through the South on Super Tuesday, claiming victory in their parties' primaries in delegate-rich Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia. The front-runners appeared ever more likely to end up in a general election showdown.
On the Republican side, Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas, the night's single biggest prize, as well as neighboring Oklahoma. Democrat Bernie Sanders picked up his home state of Vermont, as well as Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota, but failed to broaden his appeal with minority voters who are crucial to the party in presidential elections.
The night belonged to Trump and Clinton, who turned the busiest day of the 2016 primaries into a showcase of their strength with a wide swath of American voters.
Signaling her confidence, Clinton set her sights on Trump as she addressed supporters during a victory rally.
""It's clear tonight that the stakes in this election have never been higher and the rhetoric we're hearing on the other side has never been lower,"" she said.
Trump, too, had his eye on a general election match-up with the former secretary of state, casting her as part of a political establishment that has failed Americans.
""She's been there for so long,"" Trump said at his swanky Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. ""If she hasn't straightened it out by now, she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years.""
Trump's dominance has rattled Republican leaders, who fear he's unelectable against Clinton in November. Even as Trump professed to have good relationships with his party's elite, he issued a warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who declared earlier in the day that ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices."" Trump said that if the two don't get along, ""he's going to have to pay a big price.""
But all efforts to stop Trump have failed, including an aggressive campaign by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to discredit the billionaire businessman.
For Rubio, Super Tuesday turned into a bitter disappointment. He emerged with his first victory in Minnesota but failed to live up to the wider hopes of the numerous Republican officeholders who have promoted him as the party's best alternative to Trump.
With an eye on Florida's March 15 primary, Rubio vowed to keep up efforts to ""unmask the true nature of the front-runner in this race.""
Cruz desperately needed his win in Texas in order to stay in the race. He's the only Republican to beat Trump this primary season, a fact he wielded as he called on Rubio and other candidates to step aside.
""I ask you to prayerfully consider our coming together, united,"" Cruz said.
With results still coming in, Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday delegates, while Cruz picked up at least 52. Overall, Trump leads the Republican field with 221.
Sanders' wins did little to help him make up ground in his delegate race with Clinton. She was assured of winning at least 334 of the 865 at stake on Super Tuesday. That's compared to Sanders, who had at least 145 delegates.
Clinton also picked up wins in Texas, Arkansas and Massachusetts, nabbing her first victory in New England, while Trump carried the GOP contests in Arkansas and Massachusetts.
Trump's wins in the South were a major blow to Cruz, who once saw the region as his opportunity to stake a claim to the nomination. Instead, he's watched Trump, a brash New York real estate mogul, display surprising strength with evangelical Christians and social conservatives.
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming his populist appeal would fizzle. Instead, he's appeared to grow stronger, drawing broad support for some of his most controversial proposals.
In six of the states on Tuesday, large majorities of Republican voters said they supported a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States, an idea championed by Trump. Nine in 10 of Trump's voters were looking for an outsider, and half were angry with the government, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for XXX and television networks.
In the Democratic race, Clinton has steadied herself after an unexpectedly strong early challenge from Sanders. The Vermont senator did carry his home state decisively, and told the crowd at a raucous victory party that he was ""so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country.""
Sanders, who has energized supporters with his calls for a ""political revolution,"" has struggled to expand his base beyond young people and liberals. His weakness with black voters, a core part of the Democratic constituency, was underscored anew.
Clinton was supported by at least 80 percent of black voters in Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. She was also bolstered by women and older voters.
More than 90 percent of Clinton's voters wanted an insider, according to exit polls, and nearly half said experience was the top quality they were looking for in a candidate."
Rattled Republicans seek a last-ditch strategy to stop Trump,http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-02-US--Campaign%202016/id-e7c2bf2b3be84ece8f6c4e635bb4302f,ap,3/2/2016 22:56:12,,"Staring down the prospect of nominating Donald Trump for president, Republicans spiraled into a chaotic, last-ditch search Wednesday for a way to save the GOP from hitching its fortunes to an unpredictable celebrity candidate without alienating his throng of followers.
Sensing a window closing fast, GOP leaders and elder statesmen toggled through a menu of scenarios but landed on none. Some amplified calls to rally around a Trump alternative, even if that alternative is Ted Cruz, a prickly conservative with few friends in the party.
Others laid out still-hazy plans for a brokered national convention, an option likely to smack of the backroom dealing Trump fans despise. Some floated more extreme measures, talking of breaking from the party and starting anew.
""It's all a play to stall it or try to deny him the nomination,"" said Neil Newhouse, a GOP pollster. ""And the problem with that is no one has the best scenario for how to do that.""
The scrambling came as the billionaire candidate racked up commanding victories in seven of eleven Super Tuesday primary contests, and the path to victory for his rivals narrowed. Trump's strength  which stretched from the Deep South to New England  exposed the depths of the divisions within the party, no matter who becomes the nominee in this election.
As Republicans surveyed the wreckage from Trump's surge, some argued there was still a chance to stop him. He was not yet on track to claim the nomination before the party's national gathering in July, according to an Associated Press delegate count. He has won 46 percent of the delegates awarded so far, and he would have to increase that to 51 percent in the remaining primaries.
""Trump had a good night, but he left the door open,"" said David Winston, a Republican pollster.
The GOP mayhem contrasted sharply with a clearer picture on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton on Tuesday locked down solid victories in seven states and was on the path to regaining her status as the inevitable nominee. Rival Sen. Bernie Sanders vowed to keep up the fight, campaigning in Maine on Wednesday.
Sanders, a fierce opponent of big money in politics, quoted director and screenwriter Adam McKay, winner of this year's Oscar for ""The Big Short"" adapted screenplay, who warned about candidates who take major contributions from ""weirdo billionaires.""
Republicans, meanwhile, looked for a wise man to calm the jitters and point the way.
Mitt Romney, their nominee four years ago, suggested he might try to fill that role. The former Massachusetts governor announced plans to speak on the ""state of the 2016 presidential race"" Thursday in Utah. Romney has moved aggressively to take on Trump in recent days, saying the billionaire's unreleased tax returns might contain ""bombshells."" But he was not expected to endorse a candidate or announce a late entry into the race himself.
Some Republican officials have said they would not support a Trump nomination, including Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford, but neither offered another alternative.
Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been approached by ""a mixture of people"" about being part of a third-party bid, said Jeff Miller, who managed Perry's failed GOP presidential campaign. But Miller said Perry found the idea ""ludicrous.""
XXX has asked Republican governors and senators if they would support Trump if he becomes the party's nominee. Of the 59 respondents, slightly less than half could not commit to backing him in November.
While his party looked for ways to stop him, Trump was trying to soften hard feelings. House Speaker Paul Ryan's office said the Trump campaign had reached out but the two men had not connected. It noted the speaker also planned to be in touch with other candidates.
If there is a chance of derailing Trump, who did not campaign Wednesday, it increasingly appears to rest with Cruz. The Texas senator came in just 25 delegates behind Trump Tuesday night, although he faces less favorable contests as the race presses on.
Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich also hold out hope they could catch fire in upcoming contests. Each must each win his home state primary on March 15 in order for that approach to have even a sliver of credibility. Rubio trails by double digits in most polls in Florida.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson all but ended his bid Wednesday, saying on his campaign website: ""I do not see a political path forward.""
Another approach to blocking Trump involves keeping the field crowded through the spring in order to keep his vote totals down. Even if he's winning states, he might be kept short of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination. That could allow Republican leaders to argue at a contested convention that the majority of GOP voters want someone else.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, that idea has the most support among those working for opponents' campaigns. Others in the party express concern about the image of the GOP establishment using arcane rules to thwart the will of voters.
There's also little consensus around the party's goals in a contested convention, beyond stopping Trump.
""The goal is this: Let's get to the convention in Cleveland and figure it out there,"" said Former New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu.
Other prominent Republicans called for more drastic measures.
""It may be necessary for men and women of principle within the party to set the self-detonation sequence as they escape the ship to a new party,"" wrote conservative blogger Erick Erickson."
Ryan: GOP nominee must reject bigotry,http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--GOP%202016-Congress/id-19fe52e8e09446a1b868b8db10d2e694,ap,3/1/2016 17:27:54,,"House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday anyone who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee must reject any racist group or individual, a tacit swipe at GOP front-runner Donald Trump.
As voters in 11 states holding GOP contests headed to the polls on Super Tuesday, Ryan told reporters that the GOP is the party of President Abraham Lincoln and ""this party does not prey on people's prejudices."" At the same time, Ryan reiterated that he will support the eventual GOP nominee.
Ryan was apparently referring to Trump's appearance Sunday on CNN when he declined to disavow the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and other white supremacists.
""When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up. So today I want to be very clear about something: If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican party there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry,"" Ryan said.
Trump subsequently disavowed Duke, blaming his interview performance Sunday on a bad earpiece.
But the episode provided fodder for candidates such as Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who said on Sunday that ""not only is that wrong, it makes him unelectable.""
Rubio quickly pounced on Trump's comments, saying the GOP ""cannot be a party who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.""
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called Trump's comments ""Really sad.""
""You're better than this,"" Cruz wrote on Twitter. ""We should all agree, racism is wrong, KKK is abhorrent.""
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi argued that ""Trump's radical agenda"" reflects the House Republican conference. Pelosi said that while some in the GOP are distancing themselves from Trump, Republicans refused to remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds and have blocked renewal of the Voting Rights Act.
""The reality is, Donald Trump is just being more candid about the agenda of discrimination House Republicans have been advancing for years,"" Pelosi said in a statement.
On Tuesday, USA Today reported that a group of about 30 African-American students from Valdosta State University were kicked out of a Trump rally by law enforcement officials.
""The only reason we were given was that Mr. Trump did not want us there,"" 22-year-old senior Brooke Gladney told the newspaper. The campaign denied any role in their ouster from the event.
Ryan bemoaned the current discourse in the GOP and said it was time to get back to focusing on how Republicans would solve the nation's problems.
""We are the party of Lincoln,"" Ryan added. ""We believe all people are created in the eyes of God and our government. This is fundamental. And if someone wants to be our nominee they must understand this.""
Ryan was the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2012. He said he has tried to avoid commenting on the presidential race but felt a need to speak up.
""I try to stay out of the day-to-day ups and downs of the primary,"" Ryan said. ""But I've said when I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up.""
Many Washington Republicans are increasingly open about their dismay at the prospect of Trump winning the GOP nomination. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., an advocate of updating U.S. immigration law, said the prospect of voting for Trump is ""not a pleasant thought at all .... I'm still holding out hope we don't have that choice."""
"Super Tuesday: Clinton, Trump look to pull away from rivals",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election%20Rdp/id-3c3eb1f1849d435089d2666ac648dcd1,ap,3/1/2016 9:27:43,,"Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton are eyeing an opportunity to pull away from their rivals on Super Tuesday, a delegate-rich dash across the country that could accelerate their march toward the general election.
Voters from Vermont to Colorado, Alaska to American Samoa and a host of states in between were heading to polling places and caucus sites on the busiest day of the 2016 primaries.
The contests come at a turbulent moment for Republicans as they grapple with the prospect of Trump becoming the party's nominee. Rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are engaged in a frantic effort to stop the billionaire  with Rubio in particular lobbing surprisingly personal attacks  but it was unclear whether they'd made their move too late.
""This is a movement,"" Trump told supporters at a rally Monday evening in Georgia. ""I'm just a messenger, folks.""
Like Trump, Clinton has won three of the four early voting contests, including a thrashing of rival Bernie Sanders in South Carolina on Saturday. Her victory there was due to overwhelming support from black voters, putting her in position for a strong showing in several Southern states with large African-American electorates that vote Tuesday.
Clinton has increasingly turned her attention to Trump in recent days, casting herself as a civil alternative to the insults and bullying that have consumed the Republican race.
""What we can't let happen is the scapegoating, the flaming, the finger pointing that is going on the Republican side,"" she told voters gathered in Springfield, Massachusetts. ""It really undermines our fabric as a nation. So, I want to do everything I can in this campaign to set us on a different course.""
Sanders, who has energized young voters with his call for a political revolution, was seeking to stay close to Clinton in the South and pick up victories in states including Minnesota and his home state of Vermont. But Sanders faces tough questions about whether he can rally minorities that are core Democratic voters.
Democrats will vote in 11 states and American Samoa on Tuesday, with 865 delegates up for grabs. Republicans will vote in 11 states, with 595 delegates at stake.
Trump was seeking to sweep the South, which would be a massive blow for Cruz. The Texas senator, a favorite of the region's social conservatives and evangelical Christians, expected the South to be his firewall, but now is simply hoping to emerge with a victory in his home state.
Rubio's goal on Super Tuesday is even more modest. He's seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count and hopes to pull off a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.
The Florida senator has cast himself as Republicans' best chance to win in a general election and has received a flood of endorsements from GOP officials after other more mainstream candidates dropped out. But he's failed to win a state so far, raising questions about his strategy for topping Trump.
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Now party leaders are divided between those who pledge to fall in line behind Trump if he wins their party's nomination and others who insist they can never back him.
An Associated Press survey of GOP senators and governors across the country showed just under half of respondents would not commit to backing Trump if he's the nominee. Their reluctance foreshadowed a potentially extraordinary split in the party this fall.
""If he becomes the nominee the Democrats are going to savage him, no question about it,"" GOP Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said. His Republican colleague from Arizona, Jeff Flake, said he was ""still holding out hope"" that he wouldn't have to make the choice about supporting Trump.
The worries among Republicans appeared to grow after Trump briefly refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke during a television interview. Trump said he had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and he did later repudiate him.
""Clearly that's caused a lot of concern,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, one of the lawmakers who would back Trump as the nominee. ""We've got about two weeks to find out whether he's going to continue his juggernaut or whether somebody else in going to pull into the pole position. But right now it looks like it's his to lose.""
States holding voting contests in both parties Tuesday are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Republicans vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad."
Talking Trump and barbecue on Super Tuesday,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/4e67281c3f754d0696fbfdee0f3f1469/Article_2016-03-01-US--GOP%202016-Super%20Tuesday-Media/id-2e310c1a964d44939c9a8e66d48d1317,ap,3/2/2016 4:56:22,,"Here's a look at highlights from television coverage of Super Tuesday voting in the presidential campaign:
___
TRUMP'S PODIUM
The broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC gave the campaign an hour of prime-time coverage, and Donald Trump put pressure on them right away.
Trump has dominated coverage almost since his announcement last summer, and was in the midst of a hybrid news conference and victory speech in Florida at 10 p.m. ET when the broadcast networks began their election specials.
That forced the networks to decide how much time they spent to giving an overview of the night, or whether they should train their cameras on the ratings magnet Trump. Of the three, CBS spent the most time on Trump as he spoke live and ABC resisted.
Trump's strategy Tuesday melted some hearts. On NBC, analysts Nicolle Wallace and Eugene Robinson both said his decision not to give a traditional speech to supporters was designed to make him look more reasonable, even presidential, to doubters. Wallace, a former spokeswoman for President George W. Bush, has been a harsh critic of Trump.
""Tonight was an improvement over the last seven days,"" she said.
___
CRUZ VS RUBIO
Republican runners-up Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio chose two different television platforms to speak to the nation.
Cruz timed his speech to supporters for the 10 p.m. hour when the broadcast networks were on the air for their specials, but they didn't cover him. Instead, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC all aired his speech live.
While he was talking, Rubio made the rounds of the broadcast networks, giving one-on-one interviews to ABC, CBS and NBC to spin his rough night. It wasn't easy: On CBS, Charlie Rose's first question was ""Are you getting out of the race?"" Lester Holt on NBC began by asking, ""Are you disheartened?"" and ABC's George Stephanopoulos pointed out, ""You're still without a win. How can you get the nomination?""
Earlier, Fox News pulled away from live coverage of Rubio's speech to supporters for a studio discussion of whether it was time for him to get out of the race. CNN ignored Rubio's speech.
___
TALKING TRUMP
Megyn Kelly and media analyst Howard Kurtz spent time on Fox News discussing whether the media had been fair in spending so much time covering Donald Trump during the campaign at the expense of time spent on other candidates.
As they talked, half of Fox's screen showed an empty stage at Trump's Florida headquarters, over the headline, ""Awaiting news conference from Donald Trump.""
Over on NBC, Lester Holt and Savannah Guthrie discussed how much the prospect of electing the first woman president played into Hillary Clinton's campaign.
""Like everything else in this campaign, it's been overtaken by events,"" Guthrie said. ""And by events, I mean Donald Trump.""
___
FEELING NO BERN
Fox News Channel is not feeling the Bern.
Along with CNN and MSNBC, Fox covered Democrat Bernie Sanders when he took the stage in his home state of Vermont to speak to supporters. But only briefly. Fox cut away from Sanders' speech at 7:33 p.m. ET, while CNN and MSNBC stayed with him until the speech ended 10 minutes later.
It wasn't like there was a lot going on. Polls were still open in most of the states that were voting at the time. Instead of showing Sanders, Fox cut to an empty stage at Ted Cruz's headquarters in Texas, and interviewed conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer and the author of the book, ""Hands Off My Gun.""

MOUTH WATERING
Brian Williams of MSNBC seemed jealous of colleague Chris Matthews' assignment reporting from a Texas roadhouse.
""Help a brother out,"" Williams implored. ""Please FedEx some pulled pork, corned bread and beans. I'd appreciate it very much."""
Trump a fixture in Super Tuesday presidential advertising,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US-GOP-2016-Trump-Ads/id-60fd3ab0258b42ed9666781e16a6ff3c,ap,3/1/2016 19:27:39,,"Donald Trump won't let anyone forget he's running for president. And over the airwaves, neither will his opponents.
In the lead-up to the Super Tuesday primary contests, more than half of all broadcast television ad spots aired in the Republican presidential race feature the controversial billionaire, an Associated Press analysis of campaign ad data found.
Overall, anti-Trump ads outnumber pro-Trump ads on broadcast airwaves nearly 3-to-1, the data show. Trump has spent about $1.4 million to air three ads that portray him positively, but groups opposing him have poured at least $5 million into at least 13 different attack ads.
The XXX analyzed broadcast and national cable TV ads aired between Feb. 21 and Feb. 28 using data from Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. The data do not include ads aired on local cable or satellite TV.
""The cumulative impact of the advertising and the candidates now taking on Trump will be to expose him for the fraud that he is,"" said Katie Packer, who is leading a super political action committee dedicated to stopping Trump. Packer's group, called Our Principles, spent mostly on cable ahead of Super Tuesday.
The Republican ad that's aired more than any other since Trump's South Carolina victory 10 days ago shows a wildly-gesturing Trump and tags him as ""erratic, unreliable."" The ad paid for by the Marco Rubio-aligned Conservative Solutions PAC has aired more than 2,300 times, with its heaviest rotation in Tennessee and Oklahoma, two of the 11 states that weigh in on the Republican race Tuesday.
That commercial also dubs Rubio opponent Ted Cruz, a Texas senator, ""calculated, underhanded,"" before turning to Rubio as the clear choice.
Cruz hammers Trump in two of his campaign ads on the air now.
One commercial airing in Arkansas and Oklahoma begins with a clip of a Trump on Fox News saying, ""I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to.""  Text overlay notes, ""That's for sure."" The ad goes on to highlight Trump comments on abortion, Planned Parenthood and Hillary Clinton that Republican voters might not like.
A different Cruz ad reminds viewers that the next president will likely pick a new Supreme Court justice and that Trump hasn't been uniformly opposed to abortion.
The Cruz-backing outside group Stand for Truth has also gotten in on the Trump bashing.
An ad airing in Tennessee, Oklahoma and Arkansas mostly touts Cruz while taking a brief swipe at Trump, running his photo in a montage with Democrats Clinton and Bernie Sanders. A narrator says, ""We can't afford to take a chance on this election.""
But Trump is rebuffing the attacks with three different campaign ads of his own. One returns fire at Cruz, calling him ""the worst kind of Washington insider, who just can't be trusted."" That is up exclusively in Cruz's home state, which the candidate has identified as a must-win.
Trump's top-broadcast ad in the past 10 days also is on air in Texas, along with Arkansas, Virginia and Tennessee.
The spot features a montage of Trump speaking in front of crowds while people who attended those rallies praise his ability to ""speak the truth"" and ""tell it like it is."" The ad ends with Trump giving a thumbs-up while audio of a stump speech plays in which he says his campaign slogan, ""We will make America great again.""
The Club for Growth begs to differ. The outside group's political arm, Club for Growth Action, is back on the air in a handful of Super Tuesday states after spending $2.5 million hitting Trump ahead of voting in Iowa and South Carolina.
""Trump wants us to think he's Mr. Tell-It-Like-It-Is, but he has a record, and it's very liberal,"" a deep-voiced narrator says in the Club for Growth ad before landing a near-rhyming blow: ""He's really just playing us for chumps.""
Yet for all the Trump attack ads up now, Packer says she doesn't expect them to make a difference on Tuesday.
That's because Packer and the leaders of other outside groups that are increasingly training their fire on Trump say they're just getting started.
Her group, Our Principles, plans to spend more than $1 million in the coming weeks airing an ad that features people who attended Trump University with little to show for it.
Another outside group, American Future Fund, says it also is beginning a ""multimillion-dollar"" anti-Trump television effort on Tuesday. The group, which does not disclose its donors, has been attracting backers who its spokesman, Stuart Roy, says have recently come to the realization that Trump is ""dangerously close"" to locking up the GOP presidential nomination.
""Pocketbooks have loosened up in recent days and weeks,"" Roy said. ""But if the question is, 'Will it be enough to stop him?' The answer is, 'It's getting a little late in the game.'""

Trump looks to extend dominance as GOP starts to panic,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016%20Election-GOP/id-1345a650bb4244f3b8880be2be5584ed,ap,3/1/2016 20:58:26,," (AP)  Donald Trump looks to extend his dominance as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio scramble for delegates in presidential primary contests across 11 states on a Super Tuesday, stained by panic from Republican leaders even before the results were known.
Fearing a Trump sweep, Republican officials across the nation lashed out at the billionaire businessman's temperament and command of the issues in the hours before voting began. Having won three consecutive primary elections, Trump was poised to tighten his grasp on the GOP nomination in primary elections from Georgia to Massachusetts and Texas to Arkansas.
""These are challenging times for the Republican Party,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who wanted to stay neutral in the GOP primary but endorsed Rubio last week. ""Those that care deeply, as myself, probably should have been engaged earlier in trying to show that Donald Trump is not the right one to lead the conservative movement and to lead our party.""
The comments came during a wild prelude to Super Tuesday that featured a dispute over the Klu Klux Klan, a violent clash between a photographer and a secret service agent, and extraordinary criticism from several Republican governors and senators who refused to say whether they would support their party's front-runner should Trump win the nomination.
A confident Trump brushed off his critics on Tuesday morning, suggesting that he's helping to grow the party and even attracting Democrats to the GOP.
""We're getting people into the party that they've never had before,"" he told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ''I can tell you the one person Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against is me.""
Trump was seeking to sweep a series of contests across the South, which would be a massive blow for Cruz, in particular. The Texas senator, a favorite of the region's social conservatives and evangelical Christians, long expected the South to be his firewall, but now simply hopes to emerge with a victory in his home state.
Rubio's goal on Super Tuesday is even more modest. He's seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count while eyeing a win in his home state of Florida on March 15. Republican officials have rallied behind Rubio over the last week, but he's failed to win a single state so far and could very well continue the winless streak on Tuesday.
The junior senator from Florida was in Minnesota on Tuesday warning voters of consequences to electing an outspoken celebrity. Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler-turned-governor of Minnesota, told XXX this week that he'd consider a third-party White House run if Rubio or Hillary Clinton are the party nominees because he doesn't ""want the revolution to die.""
""Jesse Ventura was an embarrassment,"" Rubio proclaimed to the crowd in Andover. ""Let me rephrase that: Jesse Ventura is an embarrassment.""
Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson remain in the race, but neither is expected to be a major factor on Super Tuesday.
With some fearing Trump's delegate lead could become insurmountable by the middle of the month, the best hope for Rubio, Cruz and Kasich could be a contested national convention in July. But even that could be optimistic should Trump continue to dominate.
Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Now party leaders are divided between those who pledge to fall in line behind Trump if he wins their party's nomination and others who insist they can never back him.
An Associated Press survey of GOP senators and governors across the country showed just under half of respondents would not commit to backing Trump if he's the nominee. Their reluctance foreshadowed a potentially extraordinary split in the party this fall.
""Right now we are in a very dangerous place,"" said former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman.
""You've got a con man and a bully who is moving forward with great speed to grab the party's mantle to be its standard bearer,"" Coleman, who backs Rubio, said in an interview with XXX. ""That's almost incomprehensible."""
"VIEWER'S GUIDE: About silver linings, soft spots, hard math",http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election-Watching%20Tuesday/id-3125986a7efe436b94b80bd320302e3c,ap,3/1/2016 13:51:45,,"A quarter of Americans get their say in the presidential nominating races on Super Tuesday, sounding off with a giant megaphone.
The two front-runners, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, hope Super Tuesday is definitive for them  signaling the inevitability of their march toward the party nominations.
Clinton challenger Bernie Sanders and Trump rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are desperate to drag out the drama a little longer.
A guide on what to watch for as voters in a dozen states register their preferences Tuesday night:
THE TIMELINE
If vote margins aren't too tight, expect rolling waves of race calls as polls close in various states: Georgia, Virginia and Vermont at 7 p.m. EST; Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Massachusetts at 8 p.m.; Arkansas at 8:30 p.m.; Texas, Minnesota and Colorado at 9 p.m.; Alaska at midnight. A big chunk of the electorate votes early in Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, and those early votes will show up quickly in the count, increasing the chances for fast calls in those states. Sorry Sanders, your home state of Vermont tends to be slow to report. And Minnesota, Colorado and Alaska are caucus states that could experience more hiccups than state-run primary states.
Caucuses are local meetings of registered party members organized by the state party. Primaries, on the other hand, are run by the state government and are done by secret ballot at polling stations, similar to the general election.
___
DEMOCRATIC DEMOGRAPHICS
Watch how Clinton does with minority voters across the South and beyond. If she can replicate the resounding support that she got from black voters in South Carolina, where she was favored by 9 in 10 African Americans, she'll be well situated to nail the nomination. Watch how Sanders does among young-ish voters  not just the youngest. He lost every age group but the under-30 crowd in South Carolina, which is not a big enough slice of the population to get him to a balloon drop at the Democratic Convention.
___
CRUZ'S CROWN JEWEL
It's all about Texas for Cruz. After three straight third-place finishes in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, the Texas senator most likely couldn't survive a Super Tuesday embarrassment on his home turf. A big chunk of that Texas vote already is just waiting to be counted: More than 1.7 million voters cast early ballots in the state, representing 12 percent of registered voters in the two parties and about 7 percent of registered Republicans. Even if Cruz wins the state, he's not guaranteed all 155 GOP delegates; the state awards them proportionally.
___
SILVER LININGS
With Trump poised for a big Republican delegate haul, his GOP rivals will be searching for any shreds of encouraging news to justify remaining in the race. Can Rubio point to increased margins of support even if he doesn't win anywhere? Will Cruz be celebrating increased strength among evangelicals, from whom Trump has been siphoning support? Can also-rans John Kasich and Ben Carson find anything  seriously, anything  to smile about?
___
SOUTHERN COMFORT
With seven Southern states casting ballots, it's time to see if Clinton can erect the much-talked-of southern firewall. If Sanders can't show strength beyond his Northeast home base in Vermont and neighboring Massachusetts, he'll know he's in big trouble.
___
GOING GENERAL?
Check out the election-night speeches by Clinton and Trump. Do they pivot from their primary election rivals and point themselves toward a potential general-election matchup?
___
SOFT SPOTS
Exit poll data will offer fresh clues about the candidates' potential soft spots. Does Clinton continue to have trouble with voters who place a premium on honesty? Does Trump keep falling short of Rubio among GOP voters who want a candidate who can win in November?
___
THE MATH
In the end, it's all about the delegates. And about a quarter of them, awarded proportionally, are decided on Super Tuesday. Trump came into Super Tuesday with 82, Cruz, 18, Rubio 16, Kasich 6 and Carson 4. It takes 1,237 to win the GOP nomination. Clinton entered Super Tuesday with 546 delegates  including superdelegates, the party leaders and members of Congress who can support any candidate. Sanders had 87. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination."
"Viewer's Guide: After Super Tuesday, cold hard delegate math",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election-Watching%20Wednesday/id-47d1f32acbbb451f94e993eb238f02af,ap,3/2/2016 4:19:38,,"Presidential candidates will wake up Wednesday morning to the cold, hard truth of delegate math. It might give the front-runners some breathing room, but for the rest of the field the truth may hurt.
What to watch for on the day after Super Tuesday doles out a quarter of all the delegates at stake in the GOP and Democratic nominating contests:
THE TALLY: With 12 states awarding delegates, see how the delegate totals stack up when the dust settles.
With results in some states still in flux, Donald Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday delegates and Ted Cruz at least 52. Marco Rubio had won at least 25 delegates, John Kasich 13 and Ben Carson two. There were 595 GOP delegates at stake in 11 states.
Overall, Trump led with 221 delegates, Cruz 69, Rubio, 41. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president.
On the Democratic side, Clinton was assured of winning at least 334 of the 865 delegates at stake on Super Tuesday. Sanders was sure to get at least 145. Including superdelegates, Clinton had at least 882 delegates. Sanders had at least 232. It takes 2,383 Democratic delegates to win.
GENERALLY SPEAKING: Watch how front-runners Clinton and Trump position themselves going forward. Do they focus more on their primary election rivals or pivot toward an anticipated general election matchup? Trump said Tuesday night that if Clinton hadn't straightened out Washington by now ""she isn't going to straighten it out in the next four years."" Clinton, in turn, criticized what she called the angry, divisive rhetoric from the Republican front-runner, though she did not name him.
The B-WORD: Trump's strong showing could generate fresh talk about the possibility of a brokered convention from Republicans who just can't get on board with the idea of Trump as the eventual GOP nominee.
RUBIO'S ROAD: Rubio's itinerary reflects his priorities. He campaigns Wednesday in Michigan, which votes March 8. And he's already putting big effort into his home state of Florida, which votes with a number of winner-take-all-delegates states on March 15. Early voting already has started in Florida, and Rubio has been unequivocal about its importance to him, saying:  ""We're going to win Florida. Florida is not going to vote for a con artist like Donald Trump.""
CRUZ'S COURSE:  Watch for a more aggressive Cruz, rejuvenated by victories in his home state of Texas and neighboring Oklahoma. Stressing that he's the only candidate with victories over Trump so far, Cruz on Tuesday night urged the other GOP candidates to ""prayerfully consider coming together"" and uniting against Trump. Translation: get out of the race.
GOP SOUL-SEARCHING: Keep an eye on how the GOP establishment does  or doesn't  reconcile itself to Trump. In the run-up to Tuesday's mega-round of voting, some establishment figures were vowing they'd never, ever support Trump; others were reluctantly pledging to fall in line behind the eventual nominee, whoever it is.
AM NOT, DID TOO: The rhetoric in the GOP race took a turn for the worse before Super Tuesday, featuring a series of taunts between Trump and Rubio about potential pants-wetting, bad spray tans and overactive sweat glands. Do the candidates elevate the conversation once Tuesday's big vote is past?
SANDERS' STAND: Sanders, looking for someplace to shine after wins in Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont, planned to talk strategy over breakfast Wednesday before campaigning in Maine and Michigan, where he hopes his populist message will resonate with union and blue-collar voters.
ENTHUSIASM GAP?  Check out final turnout figures from Tuesday. The first two primary states to vote  New Hampshire and South Carolina  turned out record numbers of Republican, but not Democratic, voters. If that trend continues, it could have implications for the general election.
AIR WARS: Expect to see lots of Trump thumping in the next two weeks. Ahead of Super Tuesday, anti-Trump ads outnumbered pro-Trump commercials nearly 3-to-1. That ratio is likely to grow. Three outside groups, Our Principles, American Future Fund and Club for Growth, have laid plans for millions of dollars in new Trump attack ads. Conservative Solutions, a super political action committee backing Rubio - and blasting Trump -- has reserved $6 million of ad time for in the soon-to-vote states of Michigan, Illinois, Missouri and Florida. On the Democratic side, Clinton and Sanders both continue their campaign advertising. From the looks of the ad reservations, Sanders is betting big on Michigan, spending more than two-thirds of future ad money there."

That doesn't mean they'll stop trying.
What to watch for Wednesday, the day after Trump claimed another seven states in the Super Tuesday mega-vote, and Clinton widened her lead over Sanders with seven more of her own:
___
THE TALLY: With 12 states awarding delegates Tuesday, see how the delegate totals shake out.
Trump has amassed 285 delegates, Ted Cruz 161, and Marco Rubio, 87. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination.
On the Democratic side, Clinton had at least 1,005 delegates, Sanders 373. It takes 2,383 Democratic delegates to win.
___
GENERALLY SPEAKING: Watch front-runners Clinton and Trump spar from afar in an anticipated general election matchup. Trump said Tuesday night that if Clinton hasn't straightened out Washington by now ""she isn't going to straighten it out in the next four years."" Clinton, in turn, criticized what she called the angry, divisive rhetoric from the Republican front-runner, though she did not name him.
___
CRUZ'S COURSE: Watch for a more assertive Cruz, rejuvenated by victories in his home state of Texas and neighboring Oklahoma. On Tuesday night he urged the other GOP candidates to ""prayerfully consider coming together"" and uniting against Trump. Translation: Get out of the race.
___
RUBIO'S ROAD: After a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday, expect Rubio to be all-in for his home turf of Florida, a winner-take-all state that votes March 15. And he'll campaign Wednesday in Michigan, which votes March 8. Rubio, who won Minnesota on Tuesday, is still betting his more aggressive approach to Trump will pay off.
___
GOP SOUL-SEARCHING: Keep an eye on how the GOP establishment does  or doesn't  reconcile itself to Trump. In the run-up to Tuesday's mega-round of voting, some establishment figures were vowing they'd never, ever support Trump; others were reluctantly pledging to fall in line behind the eventual nominee, whoever it is. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, no fan of Cruz, lamented Tuesday night that ""we may be in a position where rallying around Ted Cruz is the only way to stop Donald Trump and I'm not so sure that would work.""
___
THE B-WORD: Trump's strong showing could generate fresh talk about the possibility of a so-called ""brokered convention"" from Republicans who just can't get on board with the idea of Trump as the eventual GOP nominee.
___
AM NOT, DID TOO: The rhetoric in the GOP race took a turn for the worse before Super Tuesday, featuring a series of taunts between Trump and Rubio about potential pants-wetting, bad spray tans and overactive sweat glands. Do the candidates elevate the conversation now that Tuesday's big vote is past?
___
SANDERS' STAND: Sanders, looking for more places to shine after wins in Oklahoma, Colorado, Minnesota and his home state of Vermont, was ready to campaign Wednesday in Maine and Michigan, where he hopes his populist message will resonate with union and blue-collar voters. And his campaign strategists scheduled a ""path forward"" breakfast to lay out his intended route to the nomination.
___
ENTHUSIASM GAP?  Check out final turnout figures from Tuesday's primaries, which showed record voting among Republican, but not Democratic, voters. If that trend continues, it could have implications for the general election. And expect Trump to take credit for it: He held out high turnout on Super Tuesday as evidence he's expanding the Republican Party.

Voices of voters as they cast ballots on Super Tuesday,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016%20Election-Voter%20Voices/id-87d62cfbd9044e72a05c7d0aa2d99881,ap,3/2/2016 5:18:43,,"Twelve states in all cast votes for presidential nominees on March 1, also known as Super Tuesday, the biggest single-day delegate haul of the nomination contests. Republicans are voting in 11 states, with 595 delegates at stake. Democrats are casting ballots in 11 states, too, plus American Samoa, with 865 delegates up for grabs.
Here's a look at what some voters had to say as they went to the polls Tuesday:
___
Jan Kearns, a special education teacher originally from Canada, recently became a U.S. citizen and was voting in her first presidential election. Experience was a key factor in her decision to support Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.
Kearns admires Clinton's stance on equal pay for women and says she knows how government works. She agreed with a lot of Sanders' positions but questioned whether he could succeed as president.
""He's a little too earthy, crunchy for the way Washington works,"" she said after voting in Framingham, Massachusetts.
___
Dormetra Henry, a 50-year-old clerical worker from Houston, said for her it was a toss-up between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump but that in the end, it was her faith that helped her decide to vote for Cruz.
""We're deeply religious and I believe Ted Cruz, he has a heart for the Lord. I believe that he is a Christian,"" said Henry, who is nondenominational but was previously Catholic.
Henry said while she had her doubts about Trump's Christian values, she still admires his strong personality.
""He says whatever he wants to say, and he doesn't really care about any repercussions,"" she said. ""That can be good and bad. You can't go into the presidential office and tell all these other countries, 'We don't care what you do,' and they bomb us. So you have to be careful.""
___
Gloria Pryor-Lewis and her daughter Greta Lewis went to Central Christian Church in Memphis to vote for Hillary Clinton.
Pryor-Lewis, a 63-year-old dentist, said she admires Clinton for being a ""strong woman.""
""Of course, my daughter calls her arrogant,"" she said, getting a laugh out of her 31-year-old daughter, who works as a receptionist in her dental office.
""I do like a strong woman like my mother,"" said Greta Lewis, who praised Clinton for her support of minorities.
""She has been the one who has stepped out to at least try to identify with most of the minorities, whether they're women, black, Asian, Hispanic,"" Greta Lewis said. ""She's the one that has taken the most time to talk about it, to have something to say about it and be firm about it, and know who the leader of the KKK is.""
___
Twin sisters Vivien and Gillian Gattie, both retired, 72 years old and originally from England, were less than thrilled at their options as they showed up to cast ballots at Boston City Hall.
""I'm so appalled at the choices,"" said Gillian, an independent who voted for President Barack Obama twice, but chose a Republican, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, as a ""protest vote"" because she didn't care for any Republican or Democrat this time around.
She said she would only vote for Hillary Clinton in November if it came down to a contest between her and Donald Trump.
Vivien, a registered Democrat who also voted for Obama in the last two presidential elections, cast her ballot for Clinton, though reluctantly.
""I voted for her because I think she can win,"" she said. ""I can't get excited for Bernie Sanders.""
Like her sister, Vivien said she has concerns about Clinton.
""I really don't care for her much. I don't trust her,"" Vivien said. ""But I think she's qualified  the most qualified of the candidates.""
Gillian agreed, adding that Clinton's record as secretary of state and the controversy over her use of personal email for official business blemished her trustworthiness.
___
Retired Marine Corps. Gen. Bill Weise joined about a dozen people waiting patiently in line at the Greenspring precinct in Fairfax County, which traditionally has the highest turnout in Virginia. The precinct is made up entirely of voters from the sprawling Greenspring retirement community.
The 86-year-old Weise says seven months of agonizing over who he'd vote for came down to the final 10 seconds before he filled in the bubble next to Ted Cruz's name. Ben Carson was his favorite candidate, but he concluded Carson wasn't viable. In sorting through the other GOP candidates, Weise felt Cruz would make better decisions than Donald Trump.
""I've read Cruz's autobiography,"" he said. ""He's not perfect. But show me somebody who is. ...The ideal candidate does not exist.""
___
Michael Kernyat of Chesterfield County, Virginia, voted for John Kasich even though he thinks he probably just threw his vote away.
The 60-year-old retired computer consultant said Kasich is ""the most reasonable person running"" but probably has no chance of beating Donald Trump.
""Nobody is going to stop that freight train,"" Kernyat said. ""I think it's going to come down between him and Hillary (Clinton).""
He said people seem to be rallying behind Trump because ""they're tired of politics as usual,"" but he prefers the moderate positions of Kasich.
""The only one who really scares me in this election is Bernie (Sanders),"" Kernyat said.
___
Jim Stephens, a 72-year-old retired pastor from Anchorage, Alaska, supported Marco Rubio.
""I believe of the three main ones, he probably has the best chance of winning against the Democratic person that's running,"" said Stephens, who now works part-time in a hardware store. He and his second wife have five daughters and 13 grandchildren.
Stephens said John Kasich would be his second choice, but he doesn't believe the Ohio governor could win in the general election.
He also had thoughts on how Donald Trump is conducting himself, comparing him to a schoolyard bully.
""I just think that doesn't show the level of stature for a presidential person,"" Stephens said.
___
Jacob Lawrence-Simon, a software developer for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, started his day as a Bernie Sanders volunteer at 4:30 a.m., hanging notices on doors to remind voters to caucus.
Lawrence-Simon, 30, said he supports Sanders because of his views on gay rights, a higher minimum wage and his ""desire to not go to war.""
""I want politicians to try to solve an issue without bombs first ... and I feel like Bernie Sanders better represents that mentality than Hillary Clinton, who seems to be like a bomb-and-fix kind of candidate,"" Lawrence-Simon said.
___
Tyler Murphy, a 26-year-old Boston resident who works as a project manager for a construction company, voted for Donald Trump on Tuesday even though he thinks the billionaire businessman is ""undeniably wrong on a lot of things.""
For better or worse, he said, the controversial candidate is the ""wake-up call"" the country needs.
""Ultimately, if we have to elect someone who is borderline crazy to get people to understand what's going on, then that's what we have to do,"" Murphy said.
An independent, he voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Barack Obama in 2008 and said he's donated to both parties in the past.
Murphy said that if Trump had not become such a viable candidate, he would likely have voted for Hillary Clinton.
""I just don't think she's going to be the person to shake people out of their seats,"" he said. ""She's not what the country needs right now."""
"Winning in Va. and Ga., Clinton looks to solidify her lead",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-03-01-US--2016-Election-DEM/id-35f4de69943349a0a8bf6f6b68833d8b,ap,3/2/2016 0:51:42,,"Hillary Clinton achieved key victories in Georgia and Virginia to extend her lead over Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who won his home state of Vermont but risks a major setback if he has a poor showing in the rest of the Super Tuesday contests.
Backed by black voters, Clinton aims for a sweep of Southern states holding primaries and polls showed her with a big advantage in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas. Sanders could only bank on the home-state win and both campaigns were vying for support in Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Oklahoma.
As polls closed, Clinton spoke to a forum of black women hosted by the television network BET at the St. Regis hotel in Miami.
""I'm thinking about how we can elevate the political dialogue away from the insults and really mean-spirited language,"" she said.
Clinton and her allies have already shifted some attention to Donald Trump, casting the Republican front-runner as divisive and unprepared to lead the country. The Republican contest, said Clinton, has ""turned into a kind of one-upsmanship on insulting.""
All told, Clinton and Sanders were competing for 865 delegates in 11 states and American Samoa on Tuesday, the biggest single-day prize of the 2016 campaign.
With her victories in Georgia and Virginia, Clinton is assured of at least 108 delegates. Sanders will receive at least 57 from Vermont. Forty-eight remain to be allocated in those three states.
Black voters powered Clinton to victory in South Carolina last weekend and were expected to give her a huge advantage throughout the South.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters in Alabama and Georgia were black, according to early results of exit polls conducted for XXX and television networks. In Texas, about 3 in 10 Democratic primary voters were Hispanic and a little fewer than 2 in 10 were black.
Greta Lewis voted with her mother at the Central Christian Church in Memphis. Both women are black and chose Clinton.
""She has been the one who has stepped out to at least try to identify with most of the minorities, whether they're women, black, Asian, Hispanic,"" said Lewis, a 31-year-old receptionist at her mother's dental office.
Exit polling also showed voters pushing to continue President Barack Obama's policies rather than the kind of leftward shift championed by Sanders.
Clinton entered Tuesday with 546 delegates, including super delegates  the party leaders and members of Congress who can support any candidate. Sanders lags with 87 delegates. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.
Clinton visited Minnesota before heading to Miami, foreshadowing the importance of Florida for the general election.
Sanders decamped to Essex Junction, Vermont. He has vowed to stay in the race until the party's convention  and he showed no signs of retreating as he talked to supporters after the Vermont polls closed about income inequality, government-funded college degrees and criminal justice reform.
""This campaign is not just about electing a president  it is about transforming America,"" Sanders said.
Despite his obstacles, the Vermont senator has little incentive to fold. He reported raising more than $42 million in February, a sign that he will have the money to go deep into the spring."
