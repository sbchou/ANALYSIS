’ victory in New Hampshire means he’s assured of a majority of the state’s pledged delegates.

With 24 at stake, Sanders stands to gain at least 13. Hillary Clinton will receive at least seven.

Clinton remains ahead in the overall delegate count due to support from superdelegates — the party officials who can support the candidate of their choice.

The magic number to clinch the nomination is 2,382.
