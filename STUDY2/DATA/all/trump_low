Trump: Knock ‘the hell out of’ tomato-throwers
topic: campaign finance

Republican Donald Trump is asking his supporters to keep an eye out for potential tomato-throwers at a rally in Cedar Rapids.

Trump says he was informed by security before walking onstage at his final pre-caucus rally that someone in the Doubletree Hilton ballroom might have one to lob.
He tells supporters if they see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, they should “knock the hell out of them.”

He says, “I will pay for the legal fees, I promise.”

Trump is working to get out the vote ahead of tonight’s caucuses.
He was introduced at the rally by his most famous backer: Tea Party star Sarah Palin.
Trump is telling Iowans that it’s been a pleasure campaigning in their state and is encouraging people to get out to their caucus sites tonight.
He says, “this is the day we take our country back.”
