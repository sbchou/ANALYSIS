The Latest: Bible prominent in Final Cruz Pitches to Voters
Score: 7.9

The Latest on the 2016 race for president on the final weekend of campaigning before Monday's leadoff Iowa caucuses (all times local):

5 p.m.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is infusing his closing argument to Iowans with Biblical references as his campaign visits some of the state's conservative strongholds.

Cruz has made courting Iowa's evangelical Christians a cornerstone of his campaign and he has long tapped the Bible in his stump speech.

At a stop Saturday at Darrell's Place in Hamlin, Iowa, Cruz urged his supporters to "awaken the body of Christ that we may pull back from the abyss."

The line drew loud cheers from the western Iowa crowd.
