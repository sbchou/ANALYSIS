Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is accusing Donald Trump of running a campaign based on demagoguery and division, a strategy Sanders says has been used for decades to pit Americans against each other.

Sanders says, "That's the oldest trick in the book â€” he didn't invent it."

He says Trump's rhetoric on Muslims and immigrants is designed to "create a nation of hatred."

Sanders says turning Americans against each other only makes the rich richer while ordinary people are "fighting with each other for the crumbs."

The Democratic candidate was speaking to a raucous crowd of nearly 1,000 people in New Hampshire.
