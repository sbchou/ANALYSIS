title: The Latest: Clinton vows ‘top-to-bottom review’ of gov’t
topic: Foreign Policy/National Security

Hillary Clinton is once again being questioned on her delayed opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Clinton said during Thursday’s Democratic debate that she wanted to give President Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt and hoped the final version of the trade deal would put her concerns to rest.

She says America must trade with the rest of the world but notes that the U.S. “failed to provide the basic safety-net support” for American workers.

Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, says he believes in trade, but not any existing U.S. trade deals.

Sander says he not only opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada — he protested against it.
