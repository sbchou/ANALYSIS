Hillary Clinton dodged a request to release transcripts of her paid speeches.
Clinton was asked during Thursday’s presidential debate in New Hampshire whether she would release the transcripts of speeches she’s been paid to give to Wall Street firms.
She says: “I’ll look into it. I don’t know the status, but I will certainly look into it.”
On Wednesday, Clinton struggled when asked why she accepted $675,000 for three speeches from investment firm Goldman Sachs.
Her rival Bernie Sanders calls Wall Street “an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.” He says “the business model of Wall Street is fraud.”
