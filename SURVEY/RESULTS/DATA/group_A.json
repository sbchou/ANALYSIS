The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. \n (CNN) With the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary closing in, candidates are using every means possible to fire up the base, including relying heavily on the power of last-minute, old-fashioned, local TV advertising. \nThat goes for Republican candidate Donald Trump, who, with every outspoken statement along the campaign trail, has earned billions worth of media coverage without spending a cent. He has decided to pour some $2 million a week into TV buys for ads in those two states.  \nObviously, he's not alone. But up until last week, the candidates' TV spots were fairly standard, paint-by-number messages.\nThe new surprise in this particularly unpredictable political season, however -- the breakout ad by far -- belongs to Democrat Bernie Sanders. Yes, the sometimes grumpy-seeming, non-candy-coated, white-haired, 74-year-old socialist candidate, imitated so well by a peevish Larry David, has released a 60-second ad that is so full of love, enthusiasm and patriotic uplift (complete with flag-waving) that it's downright goose bump-inducing. \nSet to the soothing sounds of the Simon & Garfunkel classic \"America,\" the beautifully executed spot makes no claims, attacks or political statements of any kind. Rather, Sanders assumes the role of the kindly, twinkly paterfamilias, presiding magically over the country, while hugging, holding and smiling at supporters.   \nIntercut are shots of an array of solid, everyday Americans who are going about their business, drinking coffee, dancing, walking with their families and baling hay. The cuts are perfectly paced to the music, which, like Sanders, has been speaking this language since the 1960s; it gently suggests an earlier time when people were burning with ideological fervor.\nIowa is a very white state, and Sanders followers are not known for their diversity, but we do see several people of color, all suggesting the beautiful mix that is America. During the musical hooks, \"All come to look for America,\" we see sped-up digitized images of tens of thousands of Bernie's individual supporters (he is famously \"not for sale\"). \nThe visuals and music build to an emotional rally, with Sanders at the podium. By the very end, he's heard as a voice-over, saying only eight words: \"I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approved this message.\" But with this message, he's brought a sweet but nonsyrupy sense of possibility and aspiration about the future (foreshadowing his tag line, \"A Future to Believe In\") as well as a visual and aural feast for those yearning to feel-good again.\n \nCertainly, one of the reasons the Sanders ad stands out so much is that it's such a departure from the usual mudslinging.  Attack ads are nasty and dirty, but politicians use them because they work (even to sometimes suppress the vote for a particular opponent).\n\nRepublican candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are battling it out in what appears to be a very close race. Not surprisingly, both have gone negative. \nRecently, the Trump camp released a 60-second ad attacking Cruz, his neck-and-neck competitor. It shows the senator from Texas uncharacteristically stammering as he attempts to explain his stand on immigration to Fox News host Bret Baier during an appearance on Fox News last month. \nUsing actual TV news footage in political ads has several advantages: it looks good, having been created by professionals for the TV medium, and it costs the campaign next to nothing to produce. And although the clip is shown within the frame of a TV set displayed in the ad, the average viewer, while typically flipping channels, might stumble upon it midspot and mistake it for actual news.\n \nThe rarely-at-a-loss-for-words Cruz acts like he's caught in a lie about whether he approved of the 2013 Immigration Bill that some say would have given amnesty to undocumented immigrants.\n\"Sounded like you wanted the bill to pass,\" the Fox interviewer is shown saying from his side of the split screen.  And Cruz sputters over an answer that sounds very much like John Kerry's famously self-indicting line, \"I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.\" The way the ad shows the exchange, Cruz never manages to articulate a coherent answer.\nMeanwhile, the spot interrupts with a very Trumpish headline: \"What is He Talking About?\" and later another dismissive, \"Yeah, right, Ted.\"\n \nThen Trump is shown in footage from a nicely lit interview with ABC News in which he talks about securing the borders \"in a humane way.\"\n Immigration is a hot-button issue in Iowa, and the ad persuasively catches Cruz's apparent flip-flop, which could be enough to sow doubt.\n The nature of the attack on Trump in the Cruz ad is not as clear. \n \nWhile Trump used footage that showed Cruz atypically at a loss for words, the Cruz spot shows Trump in just the sort of gilded, powerful settings that he himself has flaunted on \"The Apprentice.\"  \n\nThe 30-second spot opens with the hardly engaging phrase \"Eminent Domain,\" which is a real conversation-stopper and would make most viewers blink and reach for the Fritos. It then goes on to explain that Trump forced a little old lady out of her home in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to make way for a limousine parking lot for his casino.\nThe photos and footage seem dated and picture a younger, more vital version of The Donald. All of this happened at least 25 years ago, and it looks as though Cruz is indicting Trump for being a high roller in the '80s. \nOverall, it comes off as dark, crowded and chaotic, and not compelling. The only memorable image comes at the end. It's a more recent image of Trump in a white \"Make America Great Again\" hat, waving his arm through his limousine window.  \nThe problem is that's exactly how his followers love to see him -- hardly an evil overlord, rather someone so successful that he's comfortable among the trappings of power. \nThe final frame shows the word \"TRUSTED\" in capital letters, with the TRUS in red and TED in black. The red letters stand out enough to leave the ungainly, little-thought-of word \"truss\" (as in \"tie up\") in viewers' minds, forever tied with the name Ted.  \n It's the opposite of uplifting, and I give it no cigars.","gunning_fog_4":"10.8","flesch_4":"10.7","readability_4":"57.61","index_5":"67","title_5":"First Draft: Hillary Clinton Promises Not to Be ‘Deporter in Chief’","url_5":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/12/hillary-clinton-promises-not-to-be-deporter-in-chief/","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"The New York Times","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Under pressure to consolidate her support among Latinos as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont gains ground on her in Iowa, Hillary Clinton broke with the Obama administration on a key immigration provision on Monday night and promised not to be the “deporter in chief” if elected president.\n\nSpeaking at the Iowa Black and Brown Forum, an event focused on minority issues and hosted by the television network Fusion, Mrs. Clinton said deportation raids were “sowing discord and fear” and argued that they were not an appropriate method of enforcing immigration laws. The Obama administration apprehended more than 100 adults and children from Central America and Mexico over the holidays as part of an effort to deport a new wave of immigrants who entered the United States illegally.\n\nAs she spoke at the forum, which also separately featured her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Sanders and Martin O’Malley, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign released a four-point plan for assisting Central American families in need.\n\n“It is important to put this in the broader context,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We have to have comprehensive immigration reform.”\n\nMrs. Clinton declined to promise that she would not deport children, but she said she would ensure that they had sufficient counsel and were given “due process” and a chance to tell their story and avoid deportation.\n\n“What I don’t like are the mass roundups and the raids that just pick people up and send them out in the middle of the night,” she said.\n\nIn December, Mrs. Clinton said she was “concerned” about reports of the raids but did not condemn them outright.\n\nThe three Democratic presidential candidates have been canvassing Iowa ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses. Mr. Sanders has come within three percentage points of Mrs. Clinton in the most recent poll of Iowa Democrats, and the contest has grown increasingly caustic.\n\n“It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic nomination may not be so inevitable today,” Mr. Sanders said at the event, referring to Mrs. Clinton’s more aggressive approach.\n\nMr. O’Malley, a former governor of Maryland, did his best to bolster his flagging candidacy and take advantage of some rare national exposure. Asked if he thought Mrs. Clinton would continue President Obama’s deportation policy, he appeared to take offense to the question.\n\n“No, because she is not going to win the election,” Mr. O’Malley said. “I am.”\n\nThe Democrats did their best to focus on substantive policy issues and avoid attacks on Republicans. After trying to not to mention his name earlier in the evening, however, Mrs. Clinton could not help taking a dig at Donald J. Trump. \n\nIn response to a question about what she gave Mr. Trump as a gift when attending his 2005 wedding, she said, “Nothing.” Then she elaborated on their previous relationship and offered some fodder that other Republicans might use against the billionaire real estate mogul, who is leading most polls in the Republican race.\n\n“He was basically a Democrat before he was a Republican,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He was somebody that we all knew in New York. He was supportive of Democrats. He was supportive of a lot of the causes that I cared about and the people I know cared about. Now he seems to have taken another road.”","gunning_fog_5":"8.4","flesch_5":"8.4","readability_5":"63.7","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination","gold_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html?_r=0","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The New York Times","gold_body":"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.708333333333333,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T01:09:33+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952869399,"created_at":"2016-04-08T00:24:11+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T00:22:20+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"Saratoga","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915106,"worker_id":36858304,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":1.0,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"-1","q2":"0","q3":"1","q4":"1","q5":"1","q6":"2","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"0","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"0","index_1":"95","title_1":"First Draft: Donald Trump Backer Gets $1 Million Back, Then Donates It Again","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/03/donald-trump-backer-gets-1-million-back-then-donates-it-again/","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"The “super PAC” that was supporting Donald J.

But up until last week, the candidates' TV spots were fairly standard, paint-by-number messages.\nThe new surprise in this particularly unpredictable political season, however -- the breakout ad by far -- belongs to Democrat Bernie Sanders. Yes, the sometimes grumpy-seeming, non-candy-coated, white-haired, 74-year-old socialist candidate, imitated so well by a peevish Larry David, has released a 60-second ad that is so full of love, enthusiasm and patriotic uplift (complete with flag-waving) that it's downright goose bump-inducing. \nSet to the soothing sounds of the Simon & Garfunkel classic \"America,\" the beautifully executed spot makes no claims, attacks or political statements of any kind. Rather, Sanders assumes the role of the kindly, twinkly paterfamilias, presiding magically over the country, while hugging, holding and smiling at supporters.   \nIntercut are shots of an array of solid, everyday Americans who are going about their business, drinking coffee, dancing, walking with their families and baling hay. The cuts are perfectly paced to the music, which, like Sanders, has been speaking this language since the 1960s; it gently suggests an earlier time when people were burning with ideological fervor.\nIowa is a very white state, and Sanders followers are not known for their diversity, but we do see several people of color, all suggesting the beautiful mix that is America. During the musical hooks, \"All come to look for America,\" we see sped-up digitized images of tens of thousands of Bernie's individual supporters (he is famously \"not for sale\"). \nThe visuals and music build to an emotional rally, with Sanders at the podium. By the very end, he's heard as a voice-over, saying only eight words: \"I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approved this message.\" But with this message, he's brought a sweet but nonsyrupy sense of possibility and aspiration about the future (foreshadowing his tag line, \"A Future to Believe In\") as well as a visual and aural feast for those yearning to feel-good again.\n \nCertainly, one of the reasons the Sanders ad stands out so much is that it's such a departure from the usual mudslinging.  Attack ads are nasty and dirty, but politicians use them because they work (even to sometimes suppress the vote for a particular opponent).\n\nRepublican candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are battling it out in what appears to be a very close race. Not surprisingly, both have gone negative. \nRecently, the Trump camp released a 60-second ad attacking Cruz, his neck-and-neck competitor. It shows the senator from Texas uncharacteristically stammering as he attempts to explain his stand on immigration to Fox News host Bret Baier during an appearance on Fox News last month. \nUsing actual TV news footage in political ads has several advantages: it looks good, having been created by professionals for the TV medium, and it costs the campaign next to nothing to produce. And although the clip is shown within the frame of a TV set displayed in the ad, the average viewer, while typically flipping channels, might stumble upon it midspot and mistake it for actual news.\n \nThe rarely-at-a-loss-for-words Cruz acts like he's caught in a lie about whether he approved of the 2013 Immigration Bill that some say would have given amnesty to undocumented immigrants.\n\"Sounded like you wanted the bill to pass,\" the Fox interviewer is shown saying from his side of the split screen.  And Cruz sputters over an answer that sounds very much like John Kerry's famously self-indicting line, \"I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.\" The way the ad shows the exchange, Cruz never manages to articulate a coherent answer.\nMeanwhile, the spot interrupts with a very Trumpish headline: \"What is He Talking About?\" and later another dismissive, \"Yeah, right, Ted.\"\n \nThen Trump is shown in footage from a nicely lit interview with ABC News in which he talks about securing the borders \"in a humane way.\"\n Immigration is a hot-button issue in Iowa, and the ad persuasively catches Cruz's apparent flip-flop, which could be enough to sow doubt.\n The nature of the attack on Trump in the Cruz ad is not as clear. \n \nWhile Trump used footage that showed Cruz atypically at a loss for words, the Cruz spot shows Trump in just the sort of gilded, powerful settings that he himself has flaunted on \"The Apprentice.\"  \n\nThe 30-second spot opens with the hardly engaging phrase \"Eminent Domain,\" which is a real conversation-stopper and would make most viewers blink and reach for the Fritos. It then goes on to explain that Trump forced a little old lady out of her home in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to make way for a limousine parking lot for his casino.\nThe photos and footage seem dated and picture a younger, more vital version of The Donald. All of this happened at least 25 years ago, and it looks as though Cruz is indicting Trump for being a high roller in the '80s. \nOverall, it comes off as dark, crowded and chaotic, and not compelling. The only memorable image comes at the end. It's a more recent image of Trump in a white \"Make America Great Again\" hat, waving his arm through his limousine window.  \nThe problem is that's exactly how his followers love to see him -- hardly an evil overlord, rather someone so successful that he's comfortable among the trappings of power. \nThe final frame shows the word \"TRUSTED\" in capital letters, with the TRUS in red and TED in black.

The Obama administration apprehended more than 100 adults and children from Central America and Mexico over the holidays as part of an effort to deport a new wave of immigrants who entered the United States illegally.\n\nAs she spoke at the forum, which also separately featured her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Sanders and Martin O’Malley, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign released a four-point plan for assisting Central American families in need.\n\n“It is important to put this in the broader context,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We have to have comprehensive immigration reform.”\n\nMrs. Clinton declined to promise that she would not deport children, but she said she would ensure that they had sufficient counsel and were given “due process” and a chance to tell their story and avoid deportation.\n\n“What I don’t like are the mass roundups and the raids that just pick people up and send them out in the middle of the night,” she said.\n\nIn December, Mrs. Clinton said she was “concerned” about reports of the raids but did not condemn them outright.\n\nThe three Democratic presidential candidates have been canvassing Iowa ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses. Mr. Sanders has come within three percentage points of Mrs. Clinton in the most recent poll of Iowa Democrats, and the contest has grown increasingly caustic.\n\n“It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic nomination may not be so inevitable today,” Mr. Sanders said at the event, referring to Mrs. Clinton’s more aggressive approach.\n\nMr. O’Malley, a former governor of Maryland, did his best to bolster his flagging candidacy and take advantage of some rare national exposure. Asked if he thought Mrs. Clinton would continue President Obama’s deportation policy, he appeared to take offense to the question.\n\n“No, because she is not going to win the election,” Mr. O’Malley said. “I am.”\n\nThe Democrats did their best to focus on substantive policy issues and avoid attacks on Republicans. After trying to not to mention his name earlier in the evening, however, Mrs. Clinton could not help taking a dig at Donald J. Trump. \n\nIn response to a question about what she gave Mr. Trump as a gift when attending his 2005 wedding, she said, “Nothing.” Then she elaborated on their previous relationship and offered some fodder that other Republicans might use against the billionaire real estate mogul, who is leading most polls in the Republican race.\n\n“He was basically a Democrat before he was a Republican,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He was somebody that we all knew in New York. He was supportive of Democrats. He was supportive of a lot of the causes that I cared about and the people I know cared about. Now he seems to have taken another road.”","gunning_fog_5":"8.4","flesch_5":"8.4","readability_5":"63.7","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination","gold_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html?_r=0","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The New York Times","gold_body":"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}},{"id":1952875797,"created_at":"2016-04-08T00:38:38+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T00:35:33+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"MS","city":"Madison","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915106,"worker_id":28081782,"trust":0.71875,"worker_trust":0.95,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"-1","q2":"-1","q3":"1","q4":"0","q5":"1","q6":"-1","q7":"-1","q8":"-1","q9":"-1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"donald_trump"},"unit_data":{"nil":"0","index_1":"95","title_1":"First Draft: Donald Trump Backer Gets $1 Million Back, Then Donates It Again","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/03/donald-trump-backer-gets-1-million-back-then-donates-it-again/","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"The “super PAC” that was supporting Donald J.

It was refunded to Mr. Ruffin after the super PAC was closed down. But Mr. Ruffin, who is part of a business deal with Mr. Trump at his Las Vegas hotel property, later gave precisely that amount to the event that Mr. Trump threw to benefit veterans, and to run as counterprogramming to the last Republican presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses.

He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.\n\n“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”\n\nMr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. \n\n“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”\n\nStill, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.\n\n“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote. They do that very well.”\n\nMr. Sanders went on to repeat criticisms of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to several industries and to cast himself as a candidate more interested in reforming campaign finance laws and dealing with income inequality. To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay’s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for “The Big Short,” a movie about the failure of the banking industry.\n\n“As Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. \n\nMr. Sanders also said that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he didn’t think “real change” comes from someone taking money from such industries and that instead, such change would come from millions of people demanding “a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent.”","gunning_fog_2":"10.0","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"68.1","index_3":"71","title_3":"First Draft: Hillary Clinton to Open Asian-American Outreach Effort in California","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/hillary-clinton-to-open-asian-american-outreach-effort-in-california/","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"As Republican presidential candidates brave the cold in Iowa and New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton heads to San Gabriel, Calif., on Thursday to court an increasingly important, and sometimes overlooked, demographic.\n\nMrs. Clinton will join Representative Judy Chu for the opening of the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary, an outreach group that could help Mrs. Clinton as she looks to broaden the appeal of her campaign.

He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.\n\n“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”\n\nMr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. \n\n“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”\n\nStill, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.\n\n“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. \n (CNN) With the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary closing in, candidates are using every means possible to fire up the base, including relying heavily on the power of last-minute, old-fashioned, local TV advertising. \nThat goes for Republican candidate Donald Trump, who, with every outspoken statement along the campaign trail, has earned billions worth of media coverage without spending a cent. He has decided to pour some $2 million a week into TV buys for ads in those two states.  \nObviously, he's not alone. But up until last week, the candidates' TV spots were fairly standard, paint-by-number messages.\nThe new surprise in this particularly unpredictable political season, however -- the breakout ad by far -- belongs to Democrat Bernie Sanders. Yes, the sometimes grumpy-seeming, non-candy-coated, white-haired, 74-year-old socialist candidate, imitated so well by a peevish Larry David, has released a 60-second ad that is so full of love, enthusiasm and patriotic uplift (complete with flag-waving) that it's downright goose bump-inducing. \nSet to the soothing sounds of the Simon & Garfunkel classic \"America,\" the beautifully executed spot makes no claims, attacks or political statements of any kind. Rather, Sanders assumes the role of the kindly, twinkly paterfamilias, presiding magically over the country, while hugging, holding and smiling at supporters.   \nIntercut are shots of an array of solid, everyday Americans who are going about their business, drinking coffee, dancing, walking with their families and baling hay. The cuts are perfectly paced to the music, which, like Sanders, has been speaking this language since the 1960s; it gently suggests an earlier time when people were burning with ideological fervor.\nIowa is a very white state, and Sanders followers are not known for their diversity, but we do see several people of color, all suggesting the beautiful mix that is America. During the musical hooks, \"All come to look for America,\" we see sped-up digitized images of tens of thousands of Bernie's individual supporters (he is famously \"not for sale\"). \nThe visuals and music build to an emotional rally, with Sanders at the podium. By the very end, he's heard as a voice-over, saying only eight words: \"I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approved this message.\" But with this message, he's brought a sweet but nonsyrupy sense of possibility and aspiration about the future (foreshadowing his tag line, \"A Future to Believe In\") as well as a visual and aural feast for those yearning to feel-good again.\n \nCertainly, one of the reasons the Sanders ad stands out so much is that it's such a departure from the usual mudslinging.  Attack ads are nasty and dirty, but politicians use them because they work (even to sometimes suppress the vote for a particular opponent).\n\nRepublican candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are battling it out in what appears to be a very close race. Not surprisingly, both have gone negative. \nRecently, the Trump camp released a 60-second ad attacking Cruz, his neck-and-neck competitor. It shows the senator from Texas uncharacteristically stammering as he attempts to explain his stand on immigration to Fox News host Bret Baier during an appearance on Fox News last month. \nUsing actual TV news footage in political ads has several advantages: it looks good, having been created by professionals for the TV medium, and it costs the campaign next to nothing to produce. And although the clip is shown within the frame of a TV set displayed in the ad, the average viewer, while typically flipping channels, might stumble upon it midspot and mistake it for actual news.\n \nThe rarely-at-a-loss-for-words Cruz acts like he's caught in a lie about whether he approved of the 2013 Immigration Bill that some say would have given amnesty to undocumented immigrants.\n\"Sounded like you wanted the bill to pass,\" the Fox interviewer is shown saying from his side of the split screen.  And Cruz sputters over an answer that sounds very much like John Kerry's famously self-indicting line, \"I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.\" The way the ad shows the exchange, Cruz never manages to articulate a coherent answer.\nMeanwhile, the spot interrupts with a very Trumpish headline: \"What is He Talking About?\" and later another dismissive, \"Yeah, right, Ted.\"\n \nThen Trump is shown in footage from a nicely lit interview with ABC News in which he talks about securing the borders \"in a humane way.\"\n Immigration is a hot-button issue in Iowa, and the ad persuasively catches Cruz's apparent flip-flop, which could be enough to sow doubt.\n The nature of the attack on Trump in the Cruz ad is not as clear. \n \nWhile Trump used footage that showed Cruz atypically at a loss for words, the Cruz spot shows Trump in just the sort of gilded, powerful settings that he himself has flaunted on \"The Apprentice.\"  \n\nThe 30-second spot opens with the hardly engaging phrase \"Eminent Domain,\" which is a real conversation-stopper and would make most viewers blink and reach for the Fritos. It then goes on to explain that Trump forced a little old lady out of her home in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to make way for a limousine parking lot for his casino.\nThe photos and footage seem dated and picture a younger, more vital version of The Donald. All of this happened at least 25 years ago, and it looks as though Cruz is indicting Trump for being a high roller in the '80s. \nOverall, it comes off as dark, crowded and chaotic, and not compelling. The only memorable image comes at the end. It's a more recent image of Trump in a white \"Make America Great Again\" hat, waving his arm through his limousine window.  \nThe problem is that's exactly how his followers love to see him -- hardly an evil overlord, rather someone so successful that he's comfortable among the trappings of power. \nThe final frame shows the word \"TRUSTED\" in capital letters, with the TRUS in red and TED in black. The red letters stand out enough to leave the ungainly, little-thought-of word \"truss\" (as in \"tie up\") in viewers' minds, forever tied with the name Ted.  \n It's the opposite of uplifting, and I give it no cigars.","gunning_fog_4":"10.8","flesch_4":"10.7","readability_4":"57.61","index_5":"67","title_5":"First Draft: Hillary Clinton Promises Not to Be ‘Deporter in Chief’","url_5":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/12/hillary-clinton-promises-not-to-be-deporter-in-chief/","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"The New York Times","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Under pressure to consolidate her support among Latinos as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont gains ground on her in Iowa, Hillary Clinton broke with the Obama administration on a key immigration provision on Monday night and promised not to be the “deporter in chief” if elected president.\n\nSpeaking at the Iowa Black and Brown Forum, an event focused on minority issues and hosted by the television network Fusion, Mrs. Clinton said deportation raids were “sowing discord and fear” and argued that they were not an appropriate method of enforcing immigration laws.

Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q1":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4155844155844156},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q4":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7012987012987013},"q5":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7142857142857143},"q6":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.4155844155844156},"q7":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7012987012987013},"q8":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.4155844155844156},"q9":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4155844155844156},"q10":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5844155844155844},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":1.0},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":1.0},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":0.7012987012987013},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"hillary_clinton","confidence":0.7012987012987013}}}

Trump said Monday that he would release his tax returns “at some point, probably,” after the radio host Hugh Hewitt pressed Mr. Trump about when he would make them available, warning that delaying in doing so had damaged Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012.  \n\n“When do we get tax returns, Donald Trump, because Mitt Romney got killed on this four years ago,” Mr. Hewitt said in an interview with Mr. Trump, according to a transcript provided by his aides. “”And you’ve got to get them out there as well.” \n\n“Well, we’ll get them out at some point, probably,”  Mr. Trump said. “I mean, I’m looking at it. I told my people the other day, start looking at it.” \n\nHis returns, he added, “are among the largest. I’m audited all the time by government. And I think every single year, I’ve had an audit for years. And you know, other people, friends of mine say they never get audited. I say congratulations. I have audits every year. So it’s, you know, one of those things. But we are working. They’re very complex papers, but we’re working on it.” \n\nMr. Hewitt pressed on, “Will we get them soon, do you think?” \n\n “I don’t know,” Mr. Trump replied. “I have to ask my accounting people. But we’ll be working on it. Everything is very much, you know, I gave my financials ahead of schedule, much ahead of schedule. I had a long time to give them, and I gave them immediately. And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.” \n\nMr. Romney, who was a private equity executive before he was elected governor of Massachusetts, was savaged by a “super PAC” supporting President Obama, with campaign ads calling him a heartless corporate raider. Mr. Romney did not release his tax returns until the September before the general election that year, when more people were paying attention. They showed he paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent. He had faced months of pressure to release the returns. \n\nOn the eve of Tuesday’s Republican caucuses in Nevada, where he is expected to do well, Mr. Trump also told Mr. Hewitt that he does not like the caucus system, which relies heavily on organizing and is more complex than a primary system. \n\n“I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it,” said Mr. Trump, who finished second to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Iowa caucuses. “I really don’t believe it’s a good system. You know, I like to have a person walk in, vote and leave, as opposed to walk in, sit around, and who knows what happens. So you know, that’s my preference, but let’s see. I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.” \n\nIn that regard, Mr. Trump has something in common with Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who have criticized the caucus system in the past for similar reasons.","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"12","title_2":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Gets Some Outside Help He Didn’t Ask For","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/20/bernie-sanders-gets-some-outside-help-he-didnt-ask-for/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"— America Rising PAC (@AmericaRising) January 19, 2016\n\nWith enemies like these, who needs friends?\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders often boasts that he has no “super PAC” supporting his candidacy and he has vigorously tried to keep any from forming. But he has been getting some unsolicited if mischievous help from Republican groups actively promoting the Vermont senator’s surging campaign.\n\nAmerica Rising, a Republican political action committee, reacted with glee on social media on Tuesday to a CNN/WMUR poll that showed Mr. Sanders with a large lead over Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire, sharing the news with “BREAKING” qualifiers and links to news stories.\n\nKarl Rove’s American Crossroads recently created an ad parroting Senator Bernie Sanders’s critiques of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, made repeatedly last week in the days before Sunday’s debate.\n\nAnd during the debate, Republican groups were blasting out rapid emails defending Mr. Sanders’s positions, including his universal health care plan, an issue many Republicans would embrace as warmly as they would higher taxes.\n\nAll of it, of course, is intended to get under Mrs. Clinton’s skin and promote the Democratic candidate they believe would be weaker in a general election. Republican groups and super PACs have spent nearly $5 million targeting Mrs. Clinton so far this cycle. They’ve yet to spend a dollar on advertising attacking Mr. Sanders.\n\nThe Clinton campaign released a statement saying this support only furthers their argument that Mrs. Clinton is the candidate the Republicans are most afraid of facing.\n\n“The Sanders argument falls apart when the G.O.P. spokesman is trying to help him and the Republicans run ads trying to stop Hillary Clinton in the primary,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for the Clinton campaign, in a statement. She asserted that Mr. Sanders was “taking his cues” from Mr. Rove, though the senator’s Wall Street attacks predated the Rove ad.\n\nThe effort on the right to attack Mrs. Clinton from the left has actually be underway for a while, with groups like American Crossroads and America Rising targeting digital content criticizing Mrs. Clinton’s positions on the Keystone oil pipeline, for example.\n\n“The idea is to make her life difficult in the primary,” Colin Reed, America Rising’s executive director, said last year.","gunning_fog_2":"7.6","flesch_2":"8.8","readability_2":"57.27","index_3":"75","title_3":"First Draft: Hillary Clinton Leads in Fund-Raising From Lobbyists","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/01/hillary-clinton-leads-in-fund-raising-from-lobbyists/","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"Registered lobbyists raised more money for the Democrat Hillary Clinton than for any other presidential candidate of either party during the three months ending in December, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAll told, Mrs. Clinton has taken $2 million so far from donors rounded up by lobbyists, most based in Washington.

Using footage from a lighthearted video Rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against America before cutting to video of Rubio discussing fantasy football. The ad is set to run in Iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by Rubio ahead of the caucuses.\nRubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security. \nRELATED: 2016ers hit the airwaves\nAnd a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, released an ad Tuesday touting Rubio's electability that calls him \"the one Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against,\" an attempt to tweak Cruz over concerns about his general election viability due to his hardline conservatism. \n\nCruz isn't the only candidate with whom Rubio is locking horns.\nThis week, the Florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, just as the brash governor is threatening Rubio's status as the GOP establishment's preferred candidate.\nRubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions, put up two ads in New Hampshire, blasting Christie over his record in New Jersey. The first calls Christie \"Obama's favorite Republican governor\" and criticizes his support for an Internet sales tax, the Common Core education initiative and 'liberal\" energy policies. \nThe second ad slams Christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: \"High taxes. Weak Economy. Scandals.\"\nChristie's team is hitting back. In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for \"someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out.\" The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform. \n\nMike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are hoping that strong showings in Iowa -- where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively -- will help sustain their campaigns. \nAnd as they woo social conservatives and evangelicals in the Hawkeye State, they're taking aim at Cruz.\nAn ad from Santorum's campaign this week seeks to do this by contrasting the former Pennsylvania senator's tenure with Cruz's. A narrator recounts Santorum's achievements before cutting to video of Cruz reading \"Green Eggs and Ham\" during his 2013 filibuster over Obamacare.\nHuckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super PAC, Pursuing America's Greatness, releasing an ad titled \"Two Teds.\" The attack attempts to paint Cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of Cruz at a New York City fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration.\nThe two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa -- and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, who overwhelmingly leads the rest of the GOP field according to a CNN/ORC poll released late last month, has received his share of flak from other candidates and the groups supporting them, even if they've failed to dent his seemingly impenetrable poll numbers. \nThe Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. In November, the group released a spot effectively comparing Trump to Hitler and the Nazis, and the PAC is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in New Hampshire.\nMeanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul \"reckless\" and \"impulsive\" in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he \"wasted\" $40 million.\nTrump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.","gunning_fog_4":"12.4","flesch_4":"12.3","readability_4":"53.55","index_5":"29","title_5":"Democrats hold key debate amid feuding over Sanders' medical records","url_5":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/z1CxBpCWk14/democrats-hold-key-debate-amid-feuding-over-sanders-medical-records.html","candidate_5":"Bernie Sanders","org_5":"Fox News","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he will release his medical records, after saying that any attempt by a political rival to get them is “vile and desperate,” as the primary race tightens and becomes more hard-hitting ahead of Sunday’s debate.\nSanders has increasingly cut into the lead of his rival Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, before the debate -- the final one before Iowa residents are set to vote Feb. 1 in the first Democratic and Republican caucuses.\n“Of course we’re going to release our medical records, the same way that … Clinton has gotten her medical records out,” the 74-year-old Sanders said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.\" “It is not a problem.”\nThe Vermont Independent senator and self-proclaimed Democratic-socialist had until Sunday tried to capitalize on the reported request for his medical records by David Brock, founder of the pro-Clinton super-PAC Correct the Record.  \n“They are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a fundraising email sent Saturday. \n“Bernie is in excellent health. But this personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and elections.”\nEven the Clinton campaign realized the political peril of questioning whether Sanders was fit enough to be president, instead of challenging him on such issues as health care, affordable college, Wall Street reform and income inequality.\n“Chill out. We're fighting on who would make a better president, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test,” Clinton campaign manager John Podesta tweeted Saturday to Brock.\nThe Sunday night debate will be hosted by NBC in Charleston, S.C.\nGun control has been a major issue so far in the 2016 presidential races, but it is expected to be an especially hot topic in this debate.\nClinton is hammering Sanders for just recently supporting a measure that would put more liability on gun manufacturers and for hesitating on whether to support efforts to close the so-called “Charleston loophole” -- which allows a gun sale to proceed if the federal background check on the buyer is not returned in three days.\nClinton and Sanders will be joined on stage by fellow Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley. The former Maryland governor is a strong proponent of tougher gun laws, but is polling only at about 3 percent.\nWith lots of fundraising money and a last name associated with a political dynasty, Clinton, a former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state, entered the race as the clear front-runner.\nHowever, Sanders’ progressive and inclusive message has captivated voters who appear frustrated by Wall Street and the Washington establishment controlling the direction of the country.\nSanders trailed Clinton nationally 56 percent to 31 percent in late December, but has now cut that lead to 13 percentage points, 51-to-38, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average.\nHe now trails Clinton by just 4 percentage points in Iowa, after being behind 56-27 in early November. And Sanders now leads Clinton by 7 percentage points in New Hampshire, which on Feb. 9 votes second in the country.\nThe debate will be the third so far for Democrats.\nSanders began the debate season by letting Clinton off easy, saying Americans were “sick and tired” of hearing about her email controversy, related to her tenure at the State Department.  \nStill, the Sanders campaign doesn’t appear ready to launch a major attack this time.\n “We don’t feel like we have to go in there and heat it up,” Sanders adviser Tad Devine told The Hill newspaper.","gunning_fog_5":"11.2","flesch_5":"12.3","readability_5":"48.13","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice.

I told my people the other day, start looking at it.” \n\nHis returns, he added, “are among the largest. I’m audited all the time by government. And I think every single year, I’ve had an audit for years. And you know, other people, friends of mine say they never get audited. I say congratulations. I have audits every year. So it’s, you know, one of those things. But we are working. They’re very complex papers, but we’re working on it.” \n\nMr. Hewitt pressed on, “Will we get them soon, do you think?” \n\n “I don’t know,” Mr. Trump replied. “I have to ask my accounting people. But we’ll be working on it. Everything is very much, you know, I gave my financials ahead of schedule, much ahead of schedule. I had a long time to give them, and I gave them immediately. And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.” \n\nMr. Romney, who was a private equity executive before he was elected governor of Massachusetts, was savaged by a “super PAC” supporting President Obama, with campaign ads calling him a heartless corporate raider. Mr. Romney did not release his tax returns until the September before the general election that year, when more people were paying attention. They showed he paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent. He had faced months of pressure to release the returns. \n\nOn the eve of Tuesday’s Republican caucuses in Nevada, where he is expected to do well, Mr. Trump also told Mr. Hewitt that he does not like the caucus system, which relies heavily on organizing and is more complex than a primary system. \n\n“I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it,” said Mr. Trump, who finished second to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Iowa caucuses. “I really don’t believe it’s a good system. You know, I like to have a person walk in, vote and leave, as opposed to walk in, sit around, and who knows what happens. So you know, that’s my preference, but let’s see. I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.” \n\nIn that regard, Mr. Trump has something in common with Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who have criticized the caucus system in the past for similar reasons.","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"12","title_2":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Gets Some Outside Help He Didn’t Ask For","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/20/bernie-sanders-gets-some-outside-help-he-didnt-ask-for/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"— America Rising PAC (@AmericaRising) January 19, 2016\n\nWith enemies like these, who needs friends?\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders often boasts that he has no “super PAC” supporting his candidacy and he has vigorously tried to keep any from forming. But he has been getting some unsolicited if mischievous help from Republican groups actively promoting the Vermont senator’s surging campaign.\n\nAmerica Rising, a Republican political action committee, reacted with glee on social media on Tuesday to a CNN/WMUR poll that showed Mr. Sanders with a large lead over Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire, sharing the news with “BREAKING” qualifiers and links to news stories.\n\nKarl Rove’s American Crossroads recently created an ad parroting Senator Bernie Sanders’s critiques of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, made repeatedly last week in the days before Sunday’s debate.\n\nAnd during the debate, Republican groups were blasting out rapid emails defending Mr. Sanders’s positions, including his universal health care plan, an issue many Republicans would embrace as warmly as they would higher taxes.\n\nAll of it, of course, is intended to get under Mrs. Clinton’s skin and promote the Democratic candidate they believe would be weaker in a general election. Republican groups and super PACs have spent nearly $5 million targeting Mrs. Clinton so far this cycle. They’ve yet to spend a dollar on advertising attacking Mr. Sanders.\n\nThe Clinton campaign released a statement saying this support only furthers their argument that Mrs. Clinton is the candidate the Republicans are most afraid of facing.\n\n“The Sanders argument falls apart when the G.O.P. spokesman is trying to help him and the Republicans run ads trying to stop Hillary Clinton in the primary,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for the Clinton campaign, in a statement. She asserted that Mr. Sanders was “taking his cues” from Mr. Rove, though the senator’s Wall Street attacks predated the Rove ad.\n\nThe effort on the right to attack Mrs. Clinton from the left has actually be underway for a while, with groups like American Crossroads and America Rising targeting digital content criticizing Mrs. Clinton’s positions on the Keystone oil pipeline, for example.\n\n“The idea is to make her life difficult in the primary,” Colin Reed, America Rising’s executive director, said last year.","gunning_fog_2":"7.6","flesch_2":"8.8","readability_2":"57.27","index_3":"75","title_3":"First Draft: Hillary Clinton Leads in Fund-Raising From Lobbyists","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/01/hillary-clinton-leads-in-fund-raising-from-lobbyists/","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"Registered lobbyists raised more money for the Democrat Hillary Clinton than for any other presidential candidate of either party during the three months ending in December, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAll told, Mrs. Clinton has taken $2 million so far from donors rounded up by lobbyists, most based in Washington.

Using footage from a lighthearted video Rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against America before cutting to video of Rubio discussing fantasy football. The ad is set to run in Iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by Rubio ahead of the caucuses.\nRubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security. \nRELATED: 2016ers hit the airwaves\nAnd a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, released an ad Tuesday touting Rubio's electability that calls him \"the one Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against,\" an attempt to tweak Cruz over concerns about his general election viability due to his hardline conservatism. \n\nCruz isn't the only candidate with whom Rubio is locking horns.\nThis week, the Florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, just as the brash governor is threatening Rubio's status as the GOP establishment's preferred candidate.\nRubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions, put up two ads in New Hampshire, blasting Christie over his record in New Jersey. The first calls Christie \"Obama's favorite Republican governor\" and criticizes his support for an Internet sales tax, the Common Core education initiative and 'liberal\" energy policies. \nThe second ad slams Christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: \"High taxes. Weak Economy. Scandals.\"\nChristie's team is hitting back. In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for \"someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out.\" The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform. \n\nMike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are hoping that strong showings in Iowa -- where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively -- will help sustain their campaigns. \nAnd as they woo social conservatives and evangelicals in the Hawkeye State, they're taking aim at Cruz.\nAn ad from Santorum's campaign this week seeks to do this by contrasting the former Pennsylvania senator's tenure with Cruz's. A narrator recounts Santorum's achievements before cutting to video of Cruz reading \"Green Eggs and Ham\" during his 2013 filibuster over Obamacare.\nHuckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super PAC, Pursuing America's Greatness, releasing an ad titled \"Two Teds.\" The attack attempts to paint Cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of Cruz at a New York City fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration.\nThe two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa -- and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, who overwhelmingly leads the rest of the GOP field according to a CNN/ORC poll released late last month, has received his share of flak from other candidates and the groups supporting them, even if they've failed to dent his seemingly impenetrable poll numbers. \nThe Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. In November, the group released a spot effectively comparing Trump to Hitler and the Nazis, and the PAC is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in New Hampshire.\nMeanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul \"reckless\" and \"impulsive\" in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he \"wasted\" $40 million.\nTrump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.","gunning_fog_4":"12.4","flesch_4":"12.3","readability_4":"53.55","index_5":"29","title_5":"Democrats hold key debate amid feuding over Sanders' medical records","url_5":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/z1CxBpCWk14/democrats-hold-key-debate-amid-feuding-over-sanders-medical-records.html","candidate_5":"Bernie Sanders","org_5":"Fox News","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he will release his medical records, after saying that any attempt by a political rival to get them is “vile and desperate,” as the primary race tightens and becomes more hard-hitting ahead of Sunday’s debate.\nSanders has increasingly cut into the lead of his rival Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, before the debate -- the final one before Iowa residents are set to vote Feb. 1 in the first Democratic and Republican caucuses.\n“Of course we’re going to release our medical records, the same way that … Clinton has gotten her medical records out,” the 74-year-old Sanders said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.\" “It is not a problem.”\nThe Vermont Independent senator and self-proclaimed Democratic-socialist had until Sunday tried to capitalize on the reported request for his medical records by David Brock, founder of the pro-Clinton super-PAC Correct the Record.  \n“They are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a fundraising email sent Saturday. \n“Bernie is in excellent health. But this personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and elections.”\nEven the Clinton campaign realized the political peril of questioning whether Sanders was fit enough to be president, instead of challenging him on such issues as health care, affordable college, Wall Street reform and income inequality.\n“Chill out. We're fighting on who would make a better president, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test,” Clinton campaign manager John Podesta tweeted Saturday to Brock.\nThe Sunday night debate will be hosted by NBC in Charleston, S.C.\nGun control has been a major issue so far in the 2016 presidential races, but it is expected to be an especially hot topic in this debate.\nClinton is hammering Sanders for just recently supporting a measure that would put more liability on gun manufacturers and for hesitating on whether to support efforts to close the so-called “Charleston loophole” -- which allows a gun sale to proceed if the federal background check on the buyer is not returned in three days.\nClinton and Sanders will be joined on stage by fellow Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley. The former Maryland governor is a strong proponent of tougher gun laws, but is polling only at about 3 percent.\nWith lots of fundraising money and a last name associated with a political dynasty, Clinton, a former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state, entered the race as the clear front-runner.\nHowever, Sanders’ progressive and inclusive message has captivated voters who appear frustrated by Wall Street and the Washington establishment controlling the direction of the country.\nSanders trailed Clinton nationally 56 percent to 31 percent in late December, but has now cut that lead to 13 percentage points, 51-to-38, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average.\nHe now trails Clinton by just 4 percentage points in Iowa, after being behind 56-27 in early November. And Sanders now leads Clinton by 7 percentage points in New Hampshire, which on Feb. 9 votes second in the country.\nThe debate will be the third so far for Democrats.\nSanders began the debate season by letting Clinton off easy, saying Americans were “sick and tired” of hearing about her email controversy, related to her tenure at the State Department.  \nStill, the Sanders campaign doesn’t appear ready to launch a major attack this time.\n “We don’t feel like we have to go in there and heat it up,” Sanders adviser Tad Devine told The Hill newspaper.","gunning_fog_5":"11.2","flesch_5":"12.3","readability_5":"48.13","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}},{"id":1952815849,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:55:02+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T22:54:21+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"San Jose","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915107,"worker_id":35959061,"trust":0.78125,"worker_trust":0.916847222222222,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"-1","q2":"0","q3":"1","q4":"1","q5":"-1","q6":"0","q7":"1","q8":"1","q9":"1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"donald_trump"},"unit_data":{"nil":"1","index_1":"98","title_1":"First Draft: Donald Trump Says He’ll Release Tax Returns ‘at Some Point’","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/donald-trump-says-hell-release-tax-returns-at-some-point/","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Donald J.

And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.” \n\nMr. Romney, who was a private equity executive before he was elected governor of Massachusetts, was savaged by a “super PAC” supporting President Obama, with campaign ads calling him a heartless corporate raider. Mr. Romney did not release his tax returns until the September before the general election that year, when more people were paying attention. They showed he paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent. He had faced months of pressure to release the returns. \n\nOn the eve of Tuesday’s Republican caucuses in Nevada, where he is expected to do well, Mr. Trump also told Mr. Hewitt that he does not like the caucus system, which relies heavily on organizing and is more complex than a primary system. \n\n“I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it,” said Mr. Trump, who finished second to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Iowa caucuses. “I really don’t believe it’s a good system. You know, I like to have a person walk in, vote and leave, as opposed to walk in, sit around, and who knows what happens. So you know, that’s my preference, but let’s see. I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.” \n\nIn that regard, Mr. Trump has something in common with Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who have criticized the caucus system in the past for similar reasons.","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"12","title_2":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Gets Some Outside Help He Didn’t Ask For","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/20/bernie-sanders-gets-some-outside-help-he-didnt-ask-for/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"— America Rising PAC (@AmericaRising) January 19, 2016\n\nWith enemies like these, who needs friends?\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders often boasts that he has no “super PAC” supporting his candidacy and he has vigorously tried to keep any from forming.

Using footage from a lighthearted video Rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against America before cutting to video of Rubio discussing fantasy football. The ad is set to run in Iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by Rubio ahead of the caucuses.\nRubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security. \nRELATED: 2016ers hit the airwaves\nAnd a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, released an ad Tuesday touting Rubio's electability that calls him \"the one Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against,\" an attempt to tweak Cruz over concerns about his general election viability due to his hardline conservatism. \n\nCruz isn't the only candidate with whom Rubio is locking horns.\nThis week, the Florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, just as the brash governor is threatening Rubio's status as the GOP establishment's preferred candidate.\nRubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions, put up two ads in New Hampshire, blasting Christie over his record in New Jersey. The first calls Christie \"Obama's favorite Republican governor\" and criticizes his support for an Internet sales tax, the Common Core education initiative and 'liberal\" energy policies. \nThe second ad slams Christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: \"High taxes. Weak Economy. Scandals.\"\nChristie's team is hitting back. In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for \"someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out.\" The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform. \n\nMike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are hoping that strong showings in Iowa -- where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively -- will help sustain their campaigns. \nAnd as they woo social conservatives and evangelicals in the Hawkeye State, they're taking aim at Cruz.\nAn ad from Santorum's campaign this week seeks to do this by contrasting the former Pennsylvania senator's tenure with Cruz's. A narrator recounts Santorum's achievements before cutting to video of Cruz reading \"Green Eggs and Ham\" during his 2013 filibuster over Obamacare.\nHuckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super PAC, Pursuing America's Greatness, releasing an ad titled \"Two Teds.\" The attack attempts to paint Cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of Cruz at a New York City fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration.\nThe two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa -- and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, who overwhelmingly leads the rest of the GOP field according to a CNN/ORC poll released late last month, has received his share of flak from other candidates and the groups supporting them, even if they've failed to dent his seemingly impenetrable poll numbers. \nThe Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. In November, the group released a spot effectively comparing Trump to Hitler and the Nazis, and the PAC is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in New Hampshire.\nMeanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul \"reckless\" and \"impulsive\" in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he \"wasted\" $40 million.\nTrump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.","gunning_fog_4":"12.4","flesch_4":"12.3","readability_4":"53.55","index_5":"29","title_5":"Democrats hold key debate amid feuding over Sanders' medical records","url_5":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/z1CxBpCWk14/democrats-hold-key-debate-amid-feuding-over-sanders-medical-records.html","candidate_5":"Bernie Sanders","org_5":"Fox News","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he will release his medical records, after saying that any attempt by a political rival to get them is “vile and desperate,” as the primary race tightens and becomes more hard-hitting ahead of Sunday’s debate.\nSanders has increasingly cut into the lead of his rival Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, before the debate -- the final one before Iowa residents are set to vote Feb. 1 in the first Democratic and Republican caucuses.\n“Of course we’re going to release our medical records, the same way that … Clinton has gotten her medical records out,” the 74-year-old Sanders said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.\" “It is not a problem.”\nThe Vermont Independent senator and self-proclaimed Democratic-socialist had until Sunday tried to capitalize on the reported request for his medical records by David Brock, founder of the pro-Clinton super-PAC Correct the Record.  \n“They are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a fundraising email sent Saturday. \n“Bernie is in excellent health. But this personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and elections.”\nEven the Clinton campaign realized the political peril of questioning whether Sanders was fit enough to be president, instead of challenging him on such issues as health care, affordable college, Wall Street reform and income inequality.\n“Chill out. We're fighting on who would make a better president, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test,” Clinton campaign manager John Podesta tweeted Saturday to Brock.\nThe Sunday night debate will be hosted by NBC in Charleston, S.C.\nGun control has been a major issue so far in the 2016 presidential races, but it is expected to be an especially hot topic in this debate.\nClinton is hammering Sanders for just recently supporting a measure that would put more liability on gun manufacturers and for hesitating on whether to support efforts to close the so-called “Charleston loophole” -- which allows a gun sale to proceed if the federal background check on the buyer is not returned in three days.\nClinton and Sanders will be joined on stage by fellow Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley. The former Maryland governor is a strong proponent of tougher gun laws, but is polling only at about 3 percent.\nWith lots of fundraising money and a last name associated with a political dynasty, Clinton, a former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state, entered the race as the clear front-runner.\nHowever, Sanders’ progressive and inclusive message has captivated voters who appear frustrated by Wall Street and the Washington establishment controlling the direction of the country.\nSanders trailed Clinton nationally 56 percent to 31 percent in late December, but has now cut that lead to 13 percentage points, 51-to-38, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average.\nHe now trails Clinton by just 4 percentage points in Iowa, after being behind 56-27 in early November. And Sanders now leads Clinton by 7 percentage points in New Hampshire, which on Feb. 9 votes second in the country.\nThe debate will be the third so far for Democrats.\nSanders began the debate season by letting Clinton off easy, saying Americans were “sick and tired” of hearing about her email controversy, related to her tenure at the State Department.  \nStill, the Sanders campaign doesn’t appear ready to launch a major attack this time.\n “We don’t feel like we have to go in there and heat it up,” Sanders adviser Tad Devine told The Hill newspaper.","gunning_fog_5":"11.2","flesch_5":"12.3","readability_5":"48.13","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}},{"id":1952826490,"created_at":"2016-04-07T23:09:03+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T22:55:22+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"GA","city":"Atlanta","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915107,"worker_id":34938843,"trust":0.520833333333333,"worker_trust":0.898194444444444,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"2","q1":"0","q2":"2","q3":"0","q4":"2","q5":"1","q6":"2","q7":"1","q8":"2","q9":"-1","q10":"2","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"1","index_1":"98","title_1":"First Draft: Donald Trump Says He’ll Release Tax Returns ‘at Some Point’","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/donald-trump-says-hell-release-tax-returns-at-some-point/","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Donald J.

I told my people the other day, start looking at it.” \n\nHis returns, he added, “are among the largest. I’m audited all the time by government. And I think every single year, I’ve had an audit for years. And you know, other people, friends of mine say they never get audited. I say congratulations. I have audits every year. So it’s, you know, one of those things. But we are working. They’re very complex papers, but we’re working on it.” \n\nMr. Hewitt pressed on, “Will we get them soon, do you think?” \n\n “I don’t know,” Mr. Trump replied. “I have to ask my accounting people. But we’ll be working on it. Everything is very much, you know, I gave my financials ahead of schedule, much ahead of schedule. I had a long time to give them, and I gave them immediately. And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.” \n\nMr. Romney, who was a private equity executive before he was elected governor of Massachusetts, was savaged by a “super PAC” supporting President Obama, with campaign ads calling him a heartless corporate raider. Mr. Romney did not release his tax returns until the September before the general election that year, when more people were paying attention. They showed he paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent. He had faced months of pressure to release the returns. \n\nOn the eve of Tuesday’s Republican caucuses in Nevada, where he is expected to do well, Mr. Trump also told Mr. Hewitt that he does not like the caucus system, which relies heavily on organizing and is more complex than a primary system. \n\n“I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it,” said Mr. Trump, who finished second to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Iowa caucuses. “I really don’t believe it’s a good system.

I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.” \n\nIn that regard, Mr. Trump has something in common with Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who have criticized the caucus system in the past for similar reasons.","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"12","title_2":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Gets Some Outside Help He Didn’t Ask For","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/20/bernie-sanders-gets-some-outside-help-he-didnt-ask-for/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"— America Rising PAC (@AmericaRising) January 19, 2016\n\nWith enemies like these, who needs friends?\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders often boasts that he has no “super PAC” supporting his candidacy and he has vigorously tried to keep any from forming.

They’ve yet to spend a dollar on advertising attacking Mr. Sanders.\n\nThe Clinton campaign released a statement saying this support only furthers their argument that Mrs. Clinton is the candidate the Republicans are most afraid of facing.\n\n“The Sanders argument falls apart when the G.O.P. spokesman is trying to help him and the Republicans run ads trying to stop Hillary Clinton in the primary,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for the Clinton campaign, in a statement. She asserted that Mr. Sanders was “taking his cues” from Mr. Rove, though the senator’s Wall Street attacks predated the Rove ad.\n\nThe effort on the right to attack Mrs. Clinton from the left has actually be underway for a while, with groups like American Crossroads and America Rising targeting digital content criticizing Mrs. Clinton’s positions on the Keystone oil pipeline, for example.\n\n“The idea is to make her life difficult in the primary,” Colin Reed, America Rising’s executive director, said last year.","gunning_fog_2":"7.6","flesch_2":"8.8","readability_2":"57.27","index_3":"75","title_3":"First Draft: Hillary Clinton Leads in Fund-Raising From Lobbyists","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/01/hillary-clinton-leads-in-fund-raising-from-lobbyists/","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"Registered lobbyists raised more money for the Democrat Hillary Clinton than for any other presidential candidate of either party during the three months ending in December, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAll told, Mrs. Clinton has taken $2 million so far from donors rounded up by lobbyists, most based in Washington.

Using footage from a lighthearted video Rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against America before cutting to video of Rubio discussing fantasy football. The ad is set to run in Iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by Rubio ahead of the caucuses.\nRubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security. \nRELATED: 2016ers hit the airwaves\nAnd a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, released an ad Tuesday touting Rubio's electability that calls him \"the one Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against,\" an attempt to tweak Cruz over concerns about his general election viability due to his hardline conservatism. \n\nCruz isn't the only candidate with whom Rubio is locking horns.\nThis week, the Florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, just as the brash governor is threatening Rubio's status as the GOP establishment's preferred candidate.\nRubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions, put up two ads in New Hampshire, blasting Christie over his record in New Jersey. The first calls Christie \"Obama's favorite Republican governor\" and criticizes his support for an Internet sales tax, the Common Core education initiative and 'liberal\" energy policies. \nThe second ad slams Christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: \"High taxes. Weak Economy. Scandals.\"\nChristie's team is hitting back. In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for \"someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out.\" The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform. \n\nMike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are hoping that strong showings in Iowa -- where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively -- will help sustain their campaigns. \nAnd as they woo social conservatives and evangelicals in the Hawkeye State, they're taking aim at Cruz.\nAn ad from Santorum's campaign this week seeks to do this by contrasting the former Pennsylvania senator's tenure with Cruz's. A narrator recounts Santorum's achievements before cutting to video of Cruz reading \"Green Eggs and Ham\" during his 2013 filibuster over Obamacare.\nHuckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super PAC, Pursuing America's Greatness, releasing an ad titled \"Two Teds.\" The attack attempts to paint Cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of Cruz at a New York City fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration.\nThe two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa -- and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, who overwhelmingly leads the rest of the GOP field according to a CNN/ORC poll released late last month, has received his share of flak from other candidates and the groups supporting them, even if they've failed to dent his seemingly impenetrable poll numbers. \nThe Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. In November, the group released a spot effectively comparing Trump to Hitler and the Nazis, and the PAC is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in New Hampshire.\nMeanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul \"reckless\" and \"impulsive\" in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he \"wasted\" $40 million.\nTrump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.","gunning_fog_4":"12.4","flesch_4":"12.3","readability_4":"53.55","index_5":"29","title_5":"Democrats hold key debate amid feuding over Sanders' medical records","url_5":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/z1CxBpCWk14/democrats-hold-key-debate-amid-feuding-over-sanders-medical-records.html","candidate_5":"Bernie Sanders","org_5":"Fox News","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he will release his medical records, after saying that any attempt by a political rival to get them is “vile and desperate,” as the primary race tightens and becomes more hard-hitting ahead of Sunday’s debate.\nSanders has increasingly cut into the lead of his rival Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, before the debate -- the final one before Iowa residents are set to vote Feb. 1 in the first Democratic and Republican caucuses.\n“Of course we’re going to release our medical records, the same way that … Clinton has gotten her medical records out,” the 74-year-old Sanders said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.\" “It is not a problem.”\nThe Vermont Independent senator and self-proclaimed Democratic-socialist had until Sunday tried to capitalize on the reported request for his medical records by David Brock, founder of the pro-Clinton super-PAC Correct the Record.  \n“They are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a fundraising email sent Saturday. \n“Bernie is in excellent health. But this personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and elections.”\nEven the Clinton campaign realized the political peril of questioning whether Sanders was fit enough to be president, instead of challenging him on such issues as health care, affordable college, Wall Street reform and income inequality.\n“Chill out. We're fighting on who would make a better president, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test,” Clinton campaign manager John Podesta tweeted Saturday to Brock.\nThe Sunday night debate will be hosted by NBC in Charleston, S.C.\nGun control has been a major issue so far in the 2016 presidential races, but it is expected to be an especially hot topic in this debate.\nClinton is hammering Sanders for just recently supporting a measure that would put more liability on gun manufacturers and for hesitating on whether to support efforts to close the so-called “Charleston loophole” -- which allows a gun sale to proceed if the federal background check on the buyer is not returned in three days.\nClinton and Sanders will be joined on stage by fellow Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley. The former Maryland governor is a strong proponent of tougher gun laws, but is polling only at about 3 percent.\nWith lots of fundraising money and a last name associated with a political dynasty, Clinton, a former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state, entered the race as the clear front-runner.\nHowever, Sanders’ progressive and inclusive message has captivated voters who appear frustrated by Wall Street and the Washington establishment controlling the direction of the country.\nSanders trailed Clinton nationally 56 percent to 31 percent in late December, but has now cut that lead to 13 percentage points, 51-to-38, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average.\nHe now trails Clinton by just 4 percentage points in Iowa, after being behind 56-27 in early November. And Sanders now leads Clinton by 7 percentage points in New Hampshire, which on Feb. 9 votes second in the country.\nThe debate will be the third so far for Democrats.\nSanders began the debate season by letting Clinton off easy, saying Americans were “sick and tired” of hearing about her email controversy, related to her tenure at the State Department.  \nStill, the Sanders campaign doesn’t appear ready to launch a major attack this time.\n “We don’t feel like we have to go in there and heat it up,” Sanders adviser Tad Devine told The Hill newspaper.","gunning_fog_5":"11.2","flesch_5":"12.3","readability_5":"48.13","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7737556561085974},"q1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.4343891402714933},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.4343891402714933},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7737556561085974},"q4":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4343891402714933},"q5":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6606334841628959},"q6":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7737556561085974},"q7":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q8":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4343891402714933},"q9":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.6606334841628959},"q10":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7737556561085974},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":0.6606334841628959},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":1.0},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"republican","confidence":0.7737556561085974},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"donald_trump","confidence":0.7737556561085974}}}

In a retooled stump speech flush with Trump overtones and delivered right before Trump took the stage himself, Cruz offered a checklist of fights that he had led that his opponents -- like Trump -- hadn't.\n \n\"How many people here have been burned by politicians?\" Cruz asked the crowd, hours after Cruz bashed Trump's record as more liberal than conservative. \"The stakes in 2016 have never been higher. Our country is hanging in the balance. So I've got a very simple question for the folks here: How do we not get burned again?\"\nCruz then listed off seven fights he had led, describing each as a \"time for choosing,\" a reference to Ronald Reagan's iconic 1964 speech: fighting for gun rights, traditional marriage, defunding Planned Parenthood, fighting against Obamacare, a nuclear Iran, \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants and government intervention for Wall Street and other favored industries.\n\"If someone tells you they're tea party, you can't be tea party and at the same time have supported TARP,\" Cruz said, using an acronym for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a controversial Wall Street bailout program. \"You can't be tea party and at the same time have supported Barack Obama's stimulus. You cant be tea party and at the same time support the ethanol mandate because it's good politics in Iowa and support the sugar subsidies because it's good politics in Florida.\"\nTrump is one of several candidates who support the Iowa ethanol mandate, and Rubio has advocated for his home state's subsidies. Cruz made sure to knock Republican candidates like Rubio who Cruz sees as insufficiently tough on immigration -- which is also one of Trump's signature issues.\n\"Anybody who was AWOL from the battle on the Gang of Eight has no standing as a candidate now to say they will enforce the border,\" Cruz said of the comprehensive immigration bill pushed by Rubio in 2013.\nTrump, for his part, backed off from his criticisms of Cruz that he had broadcast loudly all day on Saturday. During a 45-minute speech here, Trump left Cruz unscathed until the very end, when he mentioned the loans that Cruz received as a Senate candidate in 2012 but did not properly report to election authorities.\n \nAnd when Trump did finally mention Cruz's name, he appeared rattled after the tea party crowd loudly booed him. \n\"You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want,\" he said, the boos beginning. \"He's got bank loans from Goldman Sachs, he's got bank loans from Citibank -- and then he acts like Robin Hood?\"\nCruz, who suddenly has started criticizing Trump after seven months of refusing to do so, essentially offered South Carolina voters a roadmap to vet him. \n\"When someone announces as a Republican candidate for president, suddenly they agree with the values of everyone in this room,\" Cruz said. \"If they haven't been willing to stand and lead, you can know to an absolute fact they wouldn't do so as president either.\"","gunning_fog_2":"12.0","flesch_2":"11.9","readability_2":"54.56","index_3":"111","title_3":"First Draft: Hispanic Celebrities Denounce Donald Trump and G.O.P.

In his home state, Cruz often comes across as a rock star, a leader so admired by the grassroots that his endorsement in legislative primaries is the closest thing to a gold standard in state politics.\nBut thanks to Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, Cruz's shot at becoming President may end in Texas.\nCruz, despite his appeal as a native son ideologically in sync with a ruby red Republican base, could very well lose the Texas primary next week, a setback that would strike at the core of Cruz's southern political strategy. \nBoth Trump and Rubio are squeezing Cruz in the Lone Star State, cutting into his lead by blanketing the airwaves and working side by side to engineer an upset. Trump continues to hit Cruz with claims the senator is a \"liar,\" and Rubio wants to show he can win establishment and anti-Trump votes, which means taking from Cruz.\nNightcap: Mitt Romney predicts a 'bombshell' in Donald Trump's taxes | Sign up\nCruz aides remain optimistic that he can still compete elsewhere on Super Tuesday, but they have nevertheless sent stakes for his performance back on his home turf to new heights.\n\"This is make or break for Cruz. He has to win -- no close second is good enough,\" said Bill Miller, an unaligned, senior Republican lobbyist here. \"Unquestionably he's favored -- and it has been in the bag -- but the bag has a weak bottom.\"\nMost political observers still give Cruz the slight upper hand and expect him to claim the plurality of the state's 155 delegates, which his team believes can put him close to even in the delegate race after March 1. \nAnd Cruz certainly is not taking Texas for granted -- working the state's political machinery since the moment he announced and on Wednesday rolling out his highest-ranking endorsement yet anywhere in the country, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\nThe question, however, is whether of any of that will be able to stop the freight train of momentum that is Trump, who is planning a huge rally in Fort Worth on Friday morning.\n\"Most people are just listening to the message, and they're not necessarily going to have loyalty toward Cruz just because he's our current senator,\" said Wayne Richard, a Dallas-area activist supporting Trump. Richard acknowledged Cruz's strong field program, but was skeptical it would make much of a difference and that Texas could have a \"devastating impact\" on Cruz's White House hopes.\nRecent polling has shown Cruz with a solid, but not insurmountable lead over Trump. A Monmouth University survey released Thursday gave Cruz a particularly wide margin, putting him 15 points above Trump. And Cruz's vaunted ground game numbers 27,000 volunteers, which observers say gives Cruz even more of an edge. \nCruz is doing virtually nothing to tamp down expectations. On Tuesday, he called March 1 \"the single most important day in this presidential election.\"\n\nBut it's not just Trump that poses a threat: Cruz is also confronting an increasingly dangerous Rubio, whose campaign would like nothing more than to kneecap their arch-rival in his home state. \nThe Florida senator's super PAC has made its largest investment on Super Tuesday in Cruz's home state, sinking millions of dollars into territory it might not win with the hopes of embarrassing the candidate who really needs it.\nRubio also stands to benefit from the Bush bundler network, which is particularly deep in this town, migrating over into his camp.\n\"Rubio or bust,\" said Jacob Monty, a former Bush fundraiser here. \"No one from Bush has gone anywhere but Rubio. Rubio is the only hope for rational Republicans who would like to win the general.\"\nMonty, like other Latino Republican leaders in Houston, have also gravitated to Rubio. He was introduced at a rally in a hotel ballroom Wednesday afternoon by two of the country's most prominent Hispanic Republicans, and his crowd was more solidly Latino than most Cruz crowds.\n \n\"You're from Texas,\" Rubio told his supporters when someone interrupted him to shout something in Spanish. \"You know what he said.\"\nRubio's team recognizes it is unlikely to win as many delegates in Texas. But although some of Texas' 155 delegates are awarded statewide, most are distributed via congressional district: a candidate who earns more than 50% in one of the state's districts wins all three delegates in the district, and anyone who earns below 20% wins zero. So if Rubio's camp can surgically target Cruz and minimize his vote percentage in key districts, they can keep him from building a delegate lead on Super Tuesday.\n\"You can get nowhere near first place in Texas and still vacuum up a whole lot of delegates just because of the size of the state,\" said Todd Harris, Rubio's chief strategist. \"We're under no illusions that there won't be a resounding Ted Cruz victory, but there are things that we think we can do on the margins to sweep up some delegates -- and we're going to do it.\"\n\nCruz received a hometown hero's welcome at the Lincoln Reagan Dinner on Wednesday evening, where his stickers firmly stuck to guests' blazers.\nThat dominance wasn't always a sure thing.\nA year ago at this same dinner, the question in this city in the pre-Trump era was which of the men who have called it home would emerge victorious: Would it be Jeb Bush, whose father remains revered here by both Democrats and Republicans alike? Rick Perry, the powerful, 14-year governor? Rand Paul, who grew up in a nearby suburb? Or Cruz, who headquartered his campaign not far from his condominium? \nOr maybe an outsider: Scott Walker, who wowed as a keynote speaker here eleven months ago with odes to Reagan and who Abbott said governed \"like a Texan\" in Wisconsin.\nThe threat to Cruz has indeed been an outsider, but one that no one in this booming oil city saw coming.\nSo in the final days of the Texas primary, Cruz is looking to remind them of their shared roots. As he collected Abbott's endorsement in a factory on Wednesday afternoon, Cruz's rhetoric was awash with Texas pride and symbolism, calling on his constituents to cast aside their fascination with the New Yorker they love and vote for the Texan they know.\n\"We are not a people who are impressed by a lot of blustery rhetoric that's not backed up by truth,\" Cruz said. \"We can't be fooled by P.T. Barnum. The time for the clowns and the acrobats and the dancing bears has passed.\"","gunning_fog_4":"11.2","flesch_4":"11.1","readability_4":"56.59","index_5":"17","title_5":"First Draft: F.E.C.

That can be harder when donors use slightly different variations of their names or contribute from more than one address. Mr. Sanders’s campaign may choose to refund the excess contributions or re-designate the excess for use in a general election campaign, when candidates can accept another $2,700.\n\nBut the F.E.C.’s review suggests that the sheer volume of small contributions Mr. Sanders is receiving — more than 3 million of them so far, according to his campaign — may be straining his campaign’s ability to keep track of which donors are which. Most of the contributions cited by the commission were given by donors with relatively unusual names, whose small checks are generally easier to tally.\n\nIn early February, after the end of the fourth fund-raising quarter, Mr. Sanders’s campaign announced that it had more than 1.3 million donors, an astonishing number for so early in the campaign cycle.

As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also Republicans’ best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles.

Last year, a nonprofit called Conservative Solutions Project spent $11.6 million on commercials boosting Rubio.\nConnie Wehrkamp, a spokeswoman for New Day America, says: \"It's going to be difficult for Rubio's team to keep a straight face denying they are behind the shady dark money attacks.\"\nA spokesman for Conservative Solutions PAC says his group has nothing to do with the American Future Fund ad - and has not hesitated to contrast with other candidates in ads, meaning it would have little incentive to turn to another group to do so.\nThe leader of American Future Fund also has said no candidate allies approached him about making the ad.\n___\n2:45 p.m.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich says if elected president he'll push Congress to freeze every federal regulation not dealing with health and safety for a full year.\nCampaigning at an Elks Lodge in Salem, New Hampshire, Kasich says cutting regulations that kill small businesses would be a priority of his first 100 days. He says after sending Congress a bill to freeze regulations, he'd start a review of \"every regulation in the country.\"\nKasich has made reducing the size of government central to his campaign. A clock showing the growing national debt is standard at his town hall events, and he often cites his work to balance the federal budget when he was in Congress during the 1990s.\nKasich is the only candidate in New Hampshire on Sunday as his rivals campaign in Iowa.

In October, Singer wrote a letter to his friends encouraging them to back Rubio in the primary contests. Chicago-based investor Ken Griffin also gave $2.5 million shortly after announcing his support for Rubio in December.\nOther seven-figure contributors include Florida auto dealer and longtime Rubio booster Norman Braman, financier Cliff Asness of New York and roofing company executive David Humphreys of Missouri.\nConservative Solutions PAC began the year with about $14 million left to spend.\n___\n12:44 p.m.\nOn a day when presidential candidates report their fundraising totals for 2015 to federal regulators, Democratic contender Bernie Sanders is going a step further.

He says if you can't do that, don't speak.\nCruz attended the service with his wife, Heidi, and their two daughters. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley was also there but did not sit by Cruz.\nHousholder said after the service he wrote the sermon before he found out the Texas senator would attend and did not tailor it to him.\nCruz greeted parishioners, shook hands and took pictures before departing for his first campaign stop of the day in Iowa City.\n__\n11:20 a.m.\nEven the candidate who says he's the best, the smartest and the highest-energy in the Republican field is leaving nothing to chance a day out from the Iowa caucuses.\nAttendees at Donald Trump's event in Dubuque Saturday night awakened to an email from his Iowa political director, Chuck Laudner, personally thanking them for coming.\nAnd urging them to caucus.\n\"It is extremely important that you get out there and VOTE for Mr. Trump,\" Laudner wrote.

The State Department announced it's withholding some of those emails because the information they contain is too highly classified. The former secretary of state says she's been told some of that email correspondence included a public newspaper article. Clinton insists she never sent or received information on her personal email account that was classified at the time. She repeated her call for the emails' release.\nAs secretary of state, Clinton presided over a key piece of the government's response to the deadly 2012 assaults on a diplomatic compound and CIA quarters in Benghazi, Libya. The attacks killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and quickly became a political rallying cry for Republicans.\n___\n8:40 a.m.\nRepublican presidential contender Donald Trump says \"many\" senators will endorse his candidacy, \"very soon.\"\nTrump tells on ABC's \"This Week\" that members of the Senate will choose him over their own colleague, Sen.

In a retooled stump speech flush with Trump overtones and delivered right before Trump took the stage himself, Cruz offered a checklist of fights that he had led that his opponents -- like Trump -- hadn't.\n \n\"How many people here have been burned by politicians?\" Cruz asked the crowd, hours after Cruz bashed Trump's record as more liberal than conservative. \"The stakes in 2016 have never been higher. Our country is hanging in the balance. So I've got a very simple question for the folks here: How do we not get burned again?\"\nCruz then listed off seven fights he had led, describing each as a \"time for choosing,\" a reference to Ronald Reagan's iconic 1964 speech: fighting for gun rights, traditional marriage, defunding Planned Parenthood, fighting against Obamacare, a nuclear Iran, \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants and government intervention for Wall Street and other favored industries.\n\"If someone tells you they're tea party, you can't be tea party and at the same time have supported TARP,\" Cruz said, using an acronym for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a controversial Wall Street bailout program. \"You can't be tea party and at the same time have supported Barack Obama's stimulus. You cant be tea party and at the same time support the ethanol mandate because it's good politics in Iowa and support the sugar subsidies because it's good politics in Florida.\"\nTrump is one of several candidates who support the Iowa ethanol mandate, and Rubio has advocated for his home state's subsidies. Cruz made sure to knock Republican candidates like Rubio who Cruz sees as insufficiently tough on immigration -- which is also one of Trump's signature issues.\n\"Anybody who was AWOL from the battle on the Gang of Eight has no standing as a candidate now to say they will enforce the border,\" Cruz said of the comprehensive immigration bill pushed by Rubio in 2013.\nTrump, for his part, backed off from his criticisms of Cruz that he had broadcast loudly all day on Saturday. During a 45-minute speech here, Trump left Cruz unscathed until the very end, when he mentioned the loans that Cruz received as a Senate candidate in 2012 but did not properly report to election authorities.\n \nAnd when Trump did finally mention Cruz's name, he appeared rattled after the tea party crowd loudly booed him. \n\"You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want,\" he said, the boos beginning. \"He's got bank loans from Goldman Sachs, he's got bank loans from Citibank -- and then he acts like Robin Hood?\"\nCruz, who suddenly has started criticizing Trump after seven months of refusing to do so, essentially offered South Carolina voters a roadmap to vet him. \n\"When someone announces as a Republican candidate for president, suddenly they agree with the values of everyone in this room,\" Cruz said. \"If they haven't been willing to stand and lead, you can know to an absolute fact they wouldn't do so as president either.\"","gunning_fog_2":"12.0","flesch_2":"11.9","readability_2":"54.56","index_3":"111","title_3":"First Draft: Hispanic Celebrities Denounce Donald Trump and G.O.P.

In his home state, Cruz often comes across as a rock star, a leader so admired by the grassroots that his endorsement in legislative primaries is the closest thing to a gold standard in state politics.\nBut thanks to Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, Cruz's shot at becoming President may end in Texas.\nCruz, despite his appeal as a native son ideologically in sync with a ruby red Republican base, could very well lose the Texas primary next week, a setback that would strike at the core of Cruz's southern political strategy. \nBoth Trump and Rubio are squeezing Cruz in the Lone Star State, cutting into his lead by blanketing the airwaves and working side by side to engineer an upset. Trump continues to hit Cruz with claims the senator is a \"liar,\" and Rubio wants to show he can win establishment and anti-Trump votes, which means taking from Cruz.\nNightcap: Mitt Romney predicts a 'bombshell' in Donald Trump's taxes | Sign up\nCruz aides remain optimistic that he can still compete elsewhere on Super Tuesday, but they have nevertheless sent stakes for his performance back on his home turf to new heights.\n\"This is make or break for Cruz. He has to win -- no close second is good enough,\" said Bill Miller, an unaligned, senior Republican lobbyist here. \"Unquestionably he's favored -- and it has been in the bag -- but the bag has a weak bottom.\"\nMost political observers still give Cruz the slight upper hand and expect him to claim the plurality of the state's 155 delegates, which his team believes can put him close to even in the delegate race after March 1. \nAnd Cruz certainly is not taking Texas for granted -- working the state's political machinery since the moment he announced and on Wednesday rolling out his highest-ranking endorsement yet anywhere in the country, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\nThe question, however, is whether of any of that will be able to stop the freight train of momentum that is Trump, who is planning a huge rally in Fort Worth on Friday morning.\n\"Most people are just listening to the message, and they're not necessarily going to have loyalty toward Cruz just because he's our current senator,\" said Wayne Richard, a Dallas-area activist supporting Trump. Richard acknowledged Cruz's strong field program, but was skeptical it would make much of a difference and that Texas could have a \"devastating impact\" on Cruz's White House hopes.\nRecent polling has shown Cruz with a solid, but not insurmountable lead over Trump. A Monmouth University survey released Thursday gave Cruz a particularly wide margin, putting him 15 points above Trump. And Cruz's vaunted ground game numbers 27,000 volunteers, which observers say gives Cruz even more of an edge. \nCruz is doing virtually nothing to tamp down expectations. On Tuesday, he called March 1 \"the single most important day in this presidential election.\"\n\nBut it's not just Trump that poses a threat: Cruz is also confronting an increasingly dangerous Rubio, whose campaign would like nothing more than to kneecap their arch-rival in his home state. \nThe Florida senator's super PAC has made its largest investment on Super Tuesday in Cruz's home state, sinking millions of dollars into territory it might not win with the hopes of embarrassing the candidate who really needs it.\nRubio also stands to benefit from the Bush bundler network, which is particularly deep in this town, migrating over into his camp.\n\"Rubio or bust,\" said Jacob Monty, a former Bush fundraiser here. \"No one from Bush has gone anywhere but Rubio. Rubio is the only hope for rational Republicans who would like to win the general.\"\nMonty, like other Latino Republican leaders in Houston, have also gravitated to Rubio. He was introduced at a rally in a hotel ballroom Wednesday afternoon by two of the country's most prominent Hispanic Republicans, and his crowd was more solidly Latino than most Cruz crowds.\n \n\"You're from Texas,\" Rubio told his supporters when someone interrupted him to shout something in Spanish. \"You know what he said.\"\nRubio's team recognizes it is unlikely to win as many delegates in Texas. But although some of Texas' 155 delegates are awarded statewide, most are distributed via congressional district: a candidate who earns more than 50% in one of the state's districts wins all three delegates in the district, and anyone who earns below 20% wins zero. So if Rubio's camp can surgically target Cruz and minimize his vote percentage in key districts, they can keep him from building a delegate lead on Super Tuesday.\n\"You can get nowhere near first place in Texas and still vacuum up a whole lot of delegates just because of the size of the state,\" said Todd Harris, Rubio's chief strategist. \"We're under no illusions that there won't be a resounding Ted Cruz victory, but there are things that we think we can do on the margins to sweep up some delegates -- and we're going to do it.\"\n\nCruz received a hometown hero's welcome at the Lincoln Reagan Dinner on Wednesday evening, where his stickers firmly stuck to guests' blazers.\nThat dominance wasn't always a sure thing.\nA year ago at this same dinner, the question in this city in the pre-Trump era was which of the men who have called it home would emerge victorious: Would it be Jeb Bush, whose father remains revered here by both Democrats and Republicans alike? Rick Perry, the powerful, 14-year governor? Rand Paul, who grew up in a nearby suburb? Or Cruz, who headquartered his campaign not far from his condominium? \nOr maybe an outsider: Scott Walker, who wowed as a keynote speaker here eleven months ago with odes to Reagan and who Abbott said governed \"like a Texan\" in Wisconsin.\nThe threat to Cruz has indeed been an outsider, but one that no one in this booming oil city saw coming.\nSo in the final days of the Texas primary, Cruz is looking to remind them of their shared roots. As he collected Abbott's endorsement in a factory on Wednesday afternoon, Cruz's rhetoric was awash with Texas pride and symbolism, calling on his constituents to cast aside their fascination with the New Yorker they love and vote for the Texan they know.\n\"We are not a people who are impressed by a lot of blustery rhetoric that's not backed up by truth,\" Cruz said. \"We can't be fooled by P.T. Barnum. The time for the clowns and the acrobats and the dancing bears has passed.\"","gunning_fog_4":"11.2","flesch_4":"11.1","readability_4":"56.59","index_5":"17","title_5":"First Draft: F.E.C.

That can be harder when donors use slightly different variations of their names or contribute from more than one address. Mr. Sanders’s campaign may choose to refund the excess contributions or re-designate the excess for use in a general election campaign, when candidates can accept another $2,700.\n\nBut the F.E.C.’s review suggests that the sheer volume of small contributions Mr. Sanders is receiving — more than 3 million of them so far, according to his campaign — may be straining his campaign’s ability to keep track of which donors are which. Most of the contributions cited by the commission were given by donors with relatively unusual names, whose small checks are generally easier to tally.\n\nIn early February, after the end of the fourth fund-raising quarter, Mr. Sanders’s campaign announced that it had more than 1.3 million donors, an astonishing number for so early in the campaign cycle.

As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also Republicans’ best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles.

The best deal-maker, the best master negotiator.\"\nTrump is also joined by his pregnant daughter Ivanka and her developer husband.\nTrump says doctors advised Ivanka not to make the trip and joked about her potentially giving birth here.\n\"Wouldn't it be great if she had the baby in Iowa?\" he asks the crowd.\n4:40 p.m.\nBernie Sanders is urging his supporters to help him make history and send a message to those who back establishment politics.\nKicking off his final day of campaigning in Waterloo, Sanders says the nation will be looking at whether Iowa is prepared to move the nation away from establishment politics and economics. He says Monday night could be a \"very historic night for this country. We can make history.\"\nThe self-described \"democratic socialist\" said the country would not make progress unless voters had the \"courage\" to confront challenges head-on.\n\"If you sweep the problems under the rug they ain't going to get better,\" he said.\nSanders is pushing back against arguments by Clinton and her supporters that she would be the most electable Democrat to take on Republicans in the fall. The Vermont senator says the \"excitement and the energy is with our campaign\" and it will help the party drive a large voter turnout in the fall.\n___\n4:15 p.m.\nHundreds of people packed a fairground building in Iowa City to hear Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of celebrity backers the day before the Iowa caucuses.\nCruz says on Sunday that the stakes are too high for Iowa voters to make the wrong choice. He says \"we can't get fooled again.\"\nCruz and his wife, Heidi, were joined by Cruz's father, Rafael, and by \"Duck Dynasty\" reality TV star Phil Robertson, conservative commentator Glenn Beck and Iowa Rep. Steve King.\nRobertson says the country is mired in \"depravity\" and \"perversion,\" but Cruz can turn it around because he trusts God and James Madison, the architect of the Constitution. Robertson says \"That trumps Trump.\"\nCruz supporter Carlene Murphy, of Kalona, Iowa, says she thinks the caucuses will be tight, but that Cruz will prevail. She came to see him in Iowa City.\nMurphy says, \"I think we're going to pull through.\"\n___\n3:44 p.m.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is criticizing a mailer rival Ted Cruz's campaign sent to voters that Iowa's secretary of state says misrepresents the law.\nTrump claims at a rally in Council Bluffs that Cruz is under investigation over a \"voting violation\" notice his campaign sent to caucus goers.\nTrump says, \"You're not allowed to do it and they're investigating him now.\"\n\"It is so dishonest. It is so dishonest,\" he adds.\nIn a statement released Saturday, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate says the mailers misrepresent Iowa election law and adds, \"Accusing citizens of Iowa of a 'voting violation' based on Iowa caucus participation, or lack thereof, is false representation of an official act.\"\nBut Pate made no mention of an investigation.\nCruz told reporters in Sioux City on Saturday that the mailing is \"routine.\"\n___\n3:26 p.m.\nRubio is making an all-out appeal Sunday to about 450 pragmatic Republicans during his last question-and-answer session of the Iowa campaign.\nRubio tells the audience at the University of Northern Iowa, \"It's not just about who you like the most. It's about who gives us the best chance of winning.\"\nGroups supporting Cruz or Rubio are trading attack ads on the two senators' records on issues, especially on immigration.\nAnd although Rubio has critiqued Cruz for voting to cut military spending, he adds, \"This is not just about making a point, it's about making a difference. This election has to be about the future.\"\n___\n2:50 p.m.\nLeaders of a super PAC backing John Kasich are accusing a super PAC backing Marco Rubio of involvement in an attack ad put up by a political group that doesn't reveal its donors.\nThe American Future Fund recently spent more than $1 million on a New Hampshire commercial calling Kasich \"an Obama Republican.\" As a nonprofit, that group does not have to disclose its donors.\nAmerican Future Fund and Conservative Solutions PAC, a super PAC backing Rubio, share an ad producer, Outlaw Media, which on its website bills itself as a \"boutique\" firm.\nNew Day for America cites this and a separate secret-money group that has helped Rubio as clues that the rival candidate's backers are behind the American Future Fund ad. Last year, a nonprofit called Conservative Solutions Project spent $11.6 million on commercials boosting Rubio.\nConnie Wehrkamp, a spokeswoman for New Day America, says: \"It's going to be difficult for Rubio's team to keep a straight face denying they are behind the shady dark money attacks.\"\nA spokesman for Conservative Solutions PAC says his group has nothing to do with the American Future Fund ad - and has not hesitated to contrast with other candidates in ads, meaning it would have little incentive to turn to another group to do so.\nThe leader of American Future Fund also has said no candidate allies approached him about making the ad.\n___\n2:45 p.m.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich says if elected president he'll push Congress to freeze every federal regulation not dealing with health and safety for a full year.\nCampaigning at an Elks Lodge in Salem, New Hampshire, Kasich says cutting regulations that kill small businesses would be a priority of his first 100 days. He says after sending Congress a bill to freeze regulations, he'd start a review of \"every regulation in the country.\"\nKasich has made reducing the size of government central to his campaign. A clock showing the growing national debt is standard at his town hall events, and he often cites his work to balance the federal budget when he was in Congress during the 1990s.\nKasich is the only candidate in New Hampshire on Sunday as his rivals campaign in Iowa. He does not plan to return to Iowa for Monday's caucuses. He'll host three events in New Hampshire instead.\n___\n2:40 p.m.\nThe Democratic National Committee says it's reached an agreement in principal to have the party sanction and manage more debates during the presidential primary schedule, including a debate in New Hampshire next week.\nThe DNC says it wants to give Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley time to focus on Monday's Iowa caucuses and would finalize details on Tuesday morning.\nThe statement comes after the Clinton and Sanders' campaigns traded testy statements about plans for Thursday's debate in New Hampshire and three more during the spring.\nClinton trails Sanders in New Hampshire and wants next week's debate to help her connect with undecided voters before the state's primary on Feb. 9.\nSanders hopes to extend his run deep into the spring and adding three more forums might help him accomplish that goal.\n___\n2:35 p.m.\nMarco Rubio says watch for the boots.\nMarco Rubio says the lofty-heeled boots he caught ribbing about early this month may make a return, if he does well on caucus night.\nAt the start of a campaign event in Cedar Falls, Rubio joked with people in the front row of the University of Northern Iowa auditorium about sneaking a peak at his footwear.\nDid he have them on?\n\"No, I don't,\" he says, adding they're only for \"really, really, really, really special occasions.\nSo if Rubio does well in Monday night's caucuses, look out for them.\n\"They may come back. If I look 6-foot-4 on TV, it's because I'm wearing boots.\"\n___\n2:30 p.m.\nIowa Gov. Terry Branstad will make appearances on behalf of two candidates before the state's caucuses on Monday.\nBranstad says he'll introduce New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at an event Sunday night and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at an event Monday. He says they are the people who asked and who fit his schedule.\nThe popular six-term Republican has not endorsed a candidate, though he drew headlines recently for encouraging Iowans to support candidates other than Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz opposes the federal renewable fuel standard, which requires a minimum amount of petroleum additives such as corn-based ethanol.\nBranstad says the Bush and Christie events are just to show \"appreciation for what they've done for me.\"\n___\n1:30 p.m.\nRepublican presidential contender Donald Trump is looking to close the deal with Iowa's evangelical Christian voters on the last day before they caucus.\nTrump attended services at the First Christian Orchard Campus, a nondenominational church in Council Bluffs.\nHe, his wife, Melania, and two staffers took communion when it was passed. But Trump, momentarily confused, mistook the silver plates circulated around the auditorium and dug several bills out of his pocket.\n\"I thought it was for offering,\" he said with a laugh to his staff.\nHe contributed several minutes later when the offering plates were passed.\nAs Trump was leaving one of the church pastors put his hand on Trump's shoulder and offered a prayer, \"That Jesus would guide his decisions and that only Christ could guide his decisions,\" the pastor later said.\nTrump gladly accepted, bowing his head.\n\"Thank you, I need that,\" he said.\n___\n1:10 p.m.\nThe chief super PAC helping Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio raised more than $30 million last year, half of it in the last six months.\nConservative Solutions PAC shared its fundraising numbers ahead of a required filing Sunday with federal regulators.\nBillionaire New York investor Paul Singer gave $2.5 million, making him one of Rubio's most generous supporters. In October, Singer wrote a letter to his friends encouraging them to back Rubio in the primary contests. Chicago-based investor Ken Griffin also gave $2.5 million shortly after announcing his support for Rubio in December.\nOther seven-figure contributors include Florida auto dealer and longtime Rubio booster Norman Braman, financier Cliff Asness of New York and roofing company executive David Humphreys of Missouri.\nConservative Solutions PAC began the year with about $14 million left to spend.\n___\n12:44 p.m.\nOn a day when presidential candidates report their fundraising totals for 2015 to federal regulators, Democratic contender Bernie Sanders is going a step further. His campaign says it raised more than $20 million this month.\nThat means his pace is picking up. Earlier, his campaign said it raised $33 million over the last three months of 2015, compared to $37 million for Hillary Clinton's campaign in the same time period.\nClinton's campaign did not immediately respond to a question about its January fundraising.\n___\n12:20 p.m.\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio is upbeat entering the final stretch of his Iowa campaign, while trying to stay realistic about the outcome of Monday's contest.\nDuring an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Rubio built expectations for rival Sen. Ted Cruz as \"clearly the front-runner,\" while trying to trim his own prospects the day before the caucuses.\nA Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll of likely Republican caucus goers published Saturday showed Cruz trailing billionaire Donald Trump and Rubio in solid third.\nRubio is wrapping up a nine-day blitz of Iowa on Sunday with events in Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids and Davenport.\nRubio tells CBS: \"The crowds are growing. The people signing up are growing. Our campaign structure feels good about it...We'll have a strong showing on Monday night.\"\n___\n11:30 a. m.\nEven at church, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz can't escape politics.\nThe Texas senator attended services Sunday morning at Lutheran Church of Hope outside Des Moines. The sermon by pastor Mike Housholder called on politicians to treat their opponents with love, not attack ads.\nHousholder preached that speaking the truth with love is a better way to treat others. He says if you can't do that, don't speak.\nCruz attended the service with his wife, Heidi, and their two daughters. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley was also there but did not sit by Cruz.\nHousholder said after the service he wrote the sermon before he found out the Texas senator would attend and did not tailor it to him.\nCruz greeted parishioners, shook hands and took pictures before departing for his first campaign stop of the day in Iowa City.\n__\n11:20 a.m.\nEven the candidate who says he's the best, the smartest and the highest-energy in the Republican field is leaving nothing to chance a day out from the Iowa caucuses.\nAttendees at Donald Trump's event in Dubuque Saturday night awakened to an email from his Iowa political director, Chuck Laudner, personally thanking them for coming.\nAnd urging them to caucus.\n\"It is extremely important that you get out there and VOTE for Mr. Trump,\" Laudner wrote. Not sure where? Laudner includes a special tool \"to make this process as easy, and fun, as possible\"  the \"Republican Iowa Caucus Finder.\"\nClick the link and enter a home address and the finder will \"tell you the correct place to show up on caucus night so that you can help elect Donald Trump!\"\n___\n8:59 a.m.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says the hubbub over whether she had secret emails on her server is \"very much like Benghazi,\" a politically motivated scandal that's likely not as serious as Republicans suggest.\nClinton told ABC's \"This Week\" that \"it's pretty clear\" that Republicans are \"grasping at straws\" in their response to the latest release of emails from Clinton's private home server. The State Department announced it's withholding some of those emails because the information they contain is too highly classified. The former secretary of state says she's been told some of that email correspondence included a public newspaper article. Clinton insists she never sent or received information on her personal email account that was classified at the time. She repeated her call for the emails' release.\nAs secretary of state, Clinton presided over a key piece of the government's response to the deadly 2012 assaults on a diplomatic compound and CIA quarters in Benghazi, Libya. The attacks killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and quickly became a political rallying cry for Republicans.\n___\n8:40 a.m.\nRepublican presidential contender Donald Trump says \"many\" senators will endorse his candidacy, \"very soon.\"\nTrump tells on ABC's \"This Week\" that members of the Senate will choose him over their own colleague, Sen. Ted Cruz, who is also Trump's top rival in Iowa. Trump did not offer any senators' names.\nTrump says Cruz is \"a nasty guy\" and a \"liar,\" particularly about whether Trump essentially supports President Barack Obama's signature national health care program. Trump says he would replace that law and make other deals that would accomplish his public policy goals.\nCruz says the nation doesn't need a deal-maker, it needs a \"fighter\" for conservative causes.\n___\n8:30 a.m.\nBernie Sanders says he's ready to turn the political world upside down in Iowa.\nThe Democratic presidential candidate says that if his supporters turn out in large numbers for Monday night's caucuses, \"I think you're going to look at one of the biggest political upsets in the modern history of our country.\"\nThe Vermont senator is in a tight race with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nSanders tells CNN's \"State of the Union\" that his campaign has gotten lots of people involved in politics who hadn't been before. He mentions the working class as well as young people who no longer \"want to sit back\" but want to help direct their country's future.\n___\n7:45 a.m.\nDonald Trump isn't shy about boasting, but the Republican presidential front-runner says he also has a humble side.\nHere's what he tells CBS' \" Face the Nation\" in an interview: \"We're all the same. I mean, we're all going to the same place, probably one of two places, you know? But we're all the same.  And I do have, actually, much more humility than a lot of people would think.\"\nAsked about hiding that side, the billionaire businessman says, \"I'd rather not play my cards. I want to be unpredictable.\"\nOne thing he's not lacking is confidence. In the interview, he said \"none of the other guys will win.\"","gunning_fog_1":"8.8","flesch_1":"8.7","readability_1":"62.68","index_2":"59","title_2":"Cruz to tea party supporters: Don't get 'burned' by fake conservatives","url_2":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/ted-cruz-tea-party-rally-donald-trump-marco-rubio/index.html","candidate_2":"Ted Cruz","org_2":"CNN","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (CNN) Ted Cruz implored a Tea Party audience here on Saturday to examine closely the record of candidates like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, warning a crowd not to get \"burned\" by fake brothers in arms even as he declined to utter his rivals' names.\nThe Texas senator typically asks audiences to distinguish between \"campaign conservatives\" and \"consistent conservatives,\" but Cruz's remarks Saturday were essentially a dare to those gathered here to look finely at opponents' histories on seven key battles. In a retooled stump speech flush with Trump overtones and delivered right before Trump took the stage himself, Cruz offered a checklist of fights that he had led that his opponents -- like Trump -- hadn't.\n \n\"How many people here have been burned by politicians?\" Cruz asked the crowd, hours after Cruz bashed Trump's record as more liberal than conservative. \"The stakes in 2016 have never been higher. Our country is hanging in the balance. So I've got a very simple question for the folks here: How do we not get burned again?\"\nCruz then listed off seven fights he had led, describing each as a \"time for choosing,\" a reference to Ronald Reagan's iconic 1964 speech: fighting for gun rights, traditional marriage, defunding Planned Parenthood, fighting against Obamacare, a nuclear Iran, \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants and government intervention for Wall Street and other favored industries.\n\"If someone tells you they're tea party, you can't be tea party and at the same time have supported TARP,\" Cruz said, using an acronym for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a controversial Wall Street bailout program. \"You can't be tea party and at the same time have supported Barack Obama's stimulus. You cant be tea party and at the same time support the ethanol mandate because it's good politics in Iowa and support the sugar subsidies because it's good politics in Florida.\"\nTrump is one of several candidates who support the Iowa ethanol mandate, and Rubio has advocated for his home state's subsidies. Cruz made sure to knock Republican candidates like Rubio who Cruz sees as insufficiently tough on immigration -- which is also one of Trump's signature issues.\n\"Anybody who was AWOL from the battle on the Gang of Eight has no standing as a candidate now to say they will enforce the border,\" Cruz said of the comprehensive immigration bill pushed by Rubio in 2013.\nTrump, for his part, backed off from his criticisms of Cruz that he had broadcast loudly all day on Saturday. During a 45-minute speech here, Trump left Cruz unscathed until the very end, when he mentioned the loans that Cruz received as a Senate candidate in 2012 but did not properly report to election authorities.\n \nAnd when Trump did finally mention Cruz's name, he appeared rattled after the tea party crowd loudly booed him. \n\"You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want,\" he said, the boos beginning. \"He's got bank loans from Goldman Sachs, he's got bank loans from Citibank -- and then he acts like Robin Hood?\"\nCruz, who suddenly has started criticizing Trump after seven months of refusing to do so, essentially offered South Carolina voters a roadmap to vet him. \n\"When someone announces as a Republican candidate for president, suddenly they agree with the values of everyone in this room,\" Cruz said. \"If they haven't been willing to stand and lead, you can know to an absolute fact they wouldn't do so as president either.\"","gunning_fog_2":"12.0","flesch_2":"11.9","readability_2":"54.56","index_3":"111","title_3":"First Draft: Hispanic Celebrities Denounce Donald Trump and G.O.P.

In his home state, Cruz often comes across as a rock star, a leader so admired by the grassroots that his endorsement in legislative primaries is the closest thing to a gold standard in state politics.\nBut thanks to Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, Cruz's shot at becoming President may end in Texas.\nCruz, despite his appeal as a native son ideologically in sync with a ruby red Republican base, could very well lose the Texas primary next week, a setback that would strike at the core of Cruz's southern political strategy. \nBoth Trump and Rubio are squeezing Cruz in the Lone Star State, cutting into his lead by blanketing the airwaves and working side by side to engineer an upset. Trump continues to hit Cruz with claims the senator is a \"liar,\" and Rubio wants to show he can win establishment and anti-Trump votes, which means taking from Cruz.\nNightcap: Mitt Romney predicts a 'bombshell' in Donald Trump's taxes | Sign up\nCruz aides remain optimistic that he can still compete elsewhere on Super Tuesday, but they have nevertheless sent stakes for his performance back on his home turf to new heights.\n\"This is make or break for Cruz. He has to win -- no close second is good enough,\" said Bill Miller, an unaligned, senior Republican lobbyist here. \"Unquestionably he's favored -- and it has been in the bag -- but the bag has a weak bottom.\"\nMost political observers still give Cruz the slight upper hand and expect him to claim the plurality of the state's 155 delegates, which his team believes can put him close to even in the delegate race after March 1. \nAnd Cruz certainly is not taking Texas for granted -- working the state's political machinery since the moment he announced and on Wednesday rolling out his highest-ranking endorsement yet anywhere in the country, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\nThe question, however, is whether of any of that will be able to stop the freight train of momentum that is Trump, who is planning a huge rally in Fort Worth on Friday morning.\n\"Most people are just listening to the message, and they're not necessarily going to have loyalty toward Cruz just because he's our current senator,\" said Wayne Richard, a Dallas-area activist supporting Trump. Richard acknowledged Cruz's strong field program, but was skeptical it would make much of a difference and that Texas could have a \"devastating impact\" on Cruz's White House hopes.\nRecent polling has shown Cruz with a solid, but not insurmountable lead over Trump. A Monmouth University survey released Thursday gave Cruz a particularly wide margin, putting him 15 points above Trump. And Cruz's vaunted ground game numbers 27,000 volunteers, which observers say gives Cruz even more of an edge. \nCruz is doing virtually nothing to tamp down expectations. On Tuesday, he called March 1 \"the single most important day in this presidential election.\"\n\nBut it's not just Trump that poses a threat: Cruz is also confronting an increasingly dangerous Rubio, whose campaign would like nothing more than to kneecap their arch-rival in his home state. \nThe Florida senator's super PAC has made its largest investment on Super Tuesday in Cruz's home state, sinking millions of dollars into territory it might not win with the hopes of embarrassing the candidate who really needs it.\nRubio also stands to benefit from the Bush bundler network, which is particularly deep in this town, migrating over into his camp.\n\"Rubio or bust,\" said Jacob Monty, a former Bush fundraiser here. \"No one from Bush has gone anywhere but Rubio. Rubio is the only hope for rational Republicans who would like to win the general.\"\nMonty, like other Latino Republican leaders in Houston, have also gravitated to Rubio. He was introduced at a rally in a hotel ballroom Wednesday afternoon by two of the country's most prominent Hispanic Republicans, and his crowd was more solidly Latino than most Cruz crowds.\n \n\"You're from Texas,\" Rubio told his supporters when someone interrupted him to shout something in Spanish. \"You know what he said.\"\nRubio's team recognizes it is unlikely to win as many delegates in Texas. But although some of Texas' 155 delegates are awarded statewide, most are distributed via congressional district: a candidate who earns more than 50% in one of the state's districts wins all three delegates in the district, and anyone who earns below 20% wins zero. So if Rubio's camp can surgically target Cruz and minimize his vote percentage in key districts, they can keep him from building a delegate lead on Super Tuesday.\n\"You can get nowhere near first place in Texas and still vacuum up a whole lot of delegates just because of the size of the state,\" said Todd Harris, Rubio's chief strategist. \"We're under no illusions that there won't be a resounding Ted Cruz victory, but there are things that we think we can do on the margins to sweep up some delegates -- and we're going to do it.\"\n\nCruz received a hometown hero's welcome at the Lincoln Reagan Dinner on Wednesday evening, where his stickers firmly stuck to guests' blazers.\nThat dominance wasn't always a sure thing.\nA year ago at this same dinner, the question in this city in the pre-Trump era was which of the men who have called it home would emerge victorious: Would it be Jeb Bush, whose father remains revered here by both Democrats and Republicans alike? Rick Perry, the powerful, 14-year governor? Rand Paul, who grew up in a nearby suburb? Or Cruz, who headquartered his campaign not far from his condominium? \nOr maybe an outsider: Scott Walker, who wowed as a keynote speaker here eleven months ago with odes to Reagan and who Abbott said governed \"like a Texan\" in Wisconsin.\nThe threat to Cruz has indeed been an outsider, but one that no one in this booming oil city saw coming.\nSo in the final days of the Texas primary, Cruz is looking to remind them of their shared roots. As he collected Abbott's endorsement in a factory on Wednesday afternoon, Cruz's rhetoric was awash with Texas pride and symbolism, calling on his constituents to cast aside their fascination with the New Yorker they love and vote for the Texan they know.\n\"We are not a people who are impressed by a lot of blustery rhetoric that's not backed up by truth,\" Cruz said. \"We can't be fooled by P.T. Barnum. The time for the clowns and the acrobats and the dancing bears has passed.\"","gunning_fog_4":"11.2","flesch_4":"11.1","readability_4":"56.59","index_5":"17","title_5":"First Draft: F.E.C.

That can be harder when donors use slightly different variations of their names or contribute from more than one address. Mr. Sanders’s campaign may choose to refund the excess contributions or re-designate the excess for use in a general election campaign, when candidates can accept another $2,700.\n\nBut the F.E.C.’s review suggests that the sheer volume of small contributions Mr. Sanders is receiving — more than 3 million of them so far, according to his campaign — may be straining his campaign’s ability to keep track of which donors are which. Most of the contributions cited by the commission were given by donors with relatively unusual names, whose small checks are generally easier to tally.\n\nIn early February, after the end of the fourth fund-raising quarter, Mr. Sanders’s campaign announced that it had more than 1.3 million donors, an astonishing number for so early in the campaign cycle. And last week, the campaign announced it had received 3.25 million total donations, the most of any presidential candidate in the race.

As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also Republicans’ best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles. We support Ted Cruz for president."}},{"id":1953010174,"created_at":"2016-04-08T05:21:14+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T05:11:05+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"bitcoinget","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"KY","city":"Ashland","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915108,"worker_id":21678835,"trust":0.583333333333333,"worker_trust":0.933928571428571,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"1","q4":"0","q5":"-1","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"-1","q9":"1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"2","index_1":"108","title_1":"Trump's closing pitch to Iowa caucus-goers a family affair","url_1":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-01-31-US--2016-Election-The%20Latest/id-3b77ffea54704d26a8f9fcc61ff634b6","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"the Associated Press","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)  The Latest on the 2016 race for president on the final weekend of campaigning before Monday's leadoff Iowa caucuses:\n4:45 p.m.\nDonald Trump's closing pitch to Iowa caucus-goers is a family affair.\nThe GOP candidate's rarely-heard-from wife Melania has joined her husband at an afternoon rally after a visit to a local church.\nShe says her husband with be, \"unbelievable. The best deal-maker, the best master negotiator.\"\nTrump is also joined by his pregnant daughter Ivanka and her developer husband.\nTrump says doctors advised Ivanka not to make the trip and joked about her potentially giving birth here.\n\"Wouldn't it be great if she had the baby in Iowa?\" he asks the crowd.\n4:40 p.m.\nBernie Sanders is urging his supporters to help him make history and send a message to those who back establishment politics.\nKicking off his final day of campaigning in Waterloo, Sanders says the nation will be looking at whether Iowa is prepared to move the nation away from establishment politics and economics. He says Monday night could be a \"very historic night for this country. We can make history.\"\nThe self-described \"democratic socialist\" said the country would not make progress unless voters had the \"courage\" to confront challenges head-on.\n\"If you sweep the problems under the rug they ain't going to get better,\" he said.\nSanders is pushing back against arguments by Clinton and her supporters that she would be the most electable Democrat to take on Republicans in the fall. The Vermont senator says the \"excitement and the energy is with our campaign\" and it will help the party drive a large voter turnout in the fall.\n___\n4:15 p.m.\nHundreds of people packed a fairground building in Iowa City to hear Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of celebrity backers the day before the Iowa caucuses.\nCruz says on Sunday that the stakes are too high for Iowa voters to make the wrong choice. He says \"we can't get fooled again.\"\nCruz and his wife, Heidi, were joined by Cruz's father, Rafael, and by \"Duck Dynasty\" reality TV star Phil Robertson, conservative commentator Glenn Beck and Iowa Rep. Steve King.\nRobertson says the country is mired in \"depravity\" and \"perversion,\" but Cruz can turn it around because he trusts God and James Madison, the architect of the Constitution. Robertson says \"That trumps Trump.\"\nCruz supporter Carlene Murphy, of Kalona, Iowa, says she thinks the caucuses will be tight, but that Cruz will prevail. She came to see him in Iowa City.\nMurphy says, \"I think we're going to pull through.\"\n___\n3:44 p.m.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is criticizing a mailer rival Ted Cruz's campaign sent to voters that Iowa's secretary of state says misrepresents the law.\nTrump claims at a rally in Council Bluffs that Cruz is under investigation over a \"voting violation\" notice his campaign sent to caucus goers.\nTrump says, \"You're not allowed to do it and they're investigating him now.\"\n\"It is so dishonest. It is so dishonest,\" he adds.\nIn a statement released Saturday, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate says the mailers misrepresent Iowa election law and adds, \"Accusing citizens of Iowa of a 'voting violation' based on Iowa caucus participation, or lack thereof, is false representation of an official act.\"\nBut Pate made no mention of an investigation.\nCruz told reporters in Sioux City on Saturday that the mailing is \"routine.\"\n___\n3:26 p.m.\nRubio is making an all-out appeal Sunday to about 450 pragmatic Republicans during his last question-and-answer session of the Iowa campaign.\nRubio tells the audience at the University of Northern Iowa, \"It's not just about who you like the most. It's about who gives us the best chance of winning.\"\nGroups supporting Cruz or Rubio are trading attack ads on the two senators' records on issues, especially on immigration.\nAnd although Rubio has critiqued Cruz for voting to cut military spending, he adds, \"This is not just about making a point, it's about making a difference. This election has to be about the future.\"\n___\n2:50 p.m.\nLeaders of a super PAC backing John Kasich are accusing a super PAC backing Marco Rubio of involvement in an attack ad put up by a political group that doesn't reveal its donors.\nThe American Future Fund recently spent more than $1 million on a New Hampshire commercial calling Kasich \"an Obama Republican.\" As a nonprofit, that group does not have to disclose its donors.\nAmerican Future Fund and Conservative Solutions PAC, a super PAC backing Rubio, share an ad producer, Outlaw Media, which on its website bills itself as a \"boutique\" firm.\nNew Day for America cites this and a separate secret-money group that has helped Rubio as clues that the rival candidate's backers are behind the American Future Fund ad. Last year, a nonprofit called Conservative Solutions Project spent $11.6 million on commercials boosting Rubio.\nConnie Wehrkamp, a spokeswoman for New Day America, says: \"It's going to be difficult for Rubio's team to keep a straight face denying they are behind the shady dark money attacks.\"\nA spokesman for Conservative Solutions PAC says his group has nothing to do with the American Future Fund ad - and has not hesitated to contrast with other candidates in ads, meaning it would have little incentive to turn to another group to do so.\nThe leader of American Future Fund also has said no candidate allies approached him about making the ad.\n___\n2:45 p.m.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich says if elected president he'll push Congress to freeze every federal regulation not dealing with health and safety for a full year.\nCampaigning at an Elks Lodge in Salem, New Hampshire, Kasich says cutting regulations that kill small businesses would be a priority of his first 100 days. He says after sending Congress a bill to freeze regulations, he'd start a review of \"every regulation in the country.\"\nKasich has made reducing the size of government central to his campaign. A clock showing the growing national debt is standard at his town hall events, and he often cites his work to balance the federal budget when he was in Congress during the 1990s.\nKasich is the only candidate in New Hampshire on Sunday as his rivals campaign in Iowa. He does not plan to return to Iowa for Monday's caucuses. He'll host three events in New Hampshire instead.\n___\n2:40 p.m.\nThe Democratic National Committee says it's reached an agreement in principal to have the party sanction and manage more debates during the presidential primary schedule, including a debate in New Hampshire next week.\nThe DNC says it wants to give Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley time to focus on Monday's Iowa caucuses and would finalize details on Tuesday morning.\nThe statement comes after the Clinton and Sanders' campaigns traded testy statements about plans for Thursday's debate in New Hampshire and three more during the spring.\nClinton trails Sanders in New Hampshire and wants next week's debate to help her connect with undecided voters before the state's primary on Feb. 9.\nSanders hopes to extend his run deep into the spring and adding three more forums might help him accomplish that goal.\n___\n2:35 p.m.\nMarco Rubio says watch for the boots.\nMarco Rubio says the lofty-heeled boots he caught ribbing about early this month may make a return, if he does well on caucus night.\nAt the start of a campaign event in Cedar Falls, Rubio joked with people in the front row of the University of Northern Iowa auditorium about sneaking a peak at his footwear.\nDid he have them on?\n\"No, I don't,\" he says, adding they're only for \"really, really, really, really special occasions.\nSo if Rubio does well in Monday night's caucuses, look out for them.\n\"They may come back. If I look 6-foot-4 on TV, it's because I'm wearing boots.\"\n___\n2:30 p.m.\nIowa Gov. Terry Branstad will make appearances on behalf of two candidates before the state's caucuses on Monday.\nBranstad says he'll introduce New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at an event Sunday night and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at an event Monday. He says they are the people who asked and who fit his schedule.\nThe popular six-term Republican has not endorsed a candidate, though he drew headlines recently for encouraging Iowans to support candidates other than Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz opposes the federal renewable fuel standard, which requires a minimum amount of petroleum additives such as corn-based ethanol.\nBranstad says the Bush and Christie events are just to show \"appreciation for what they've done for me.\"\n___\n1:30 p.m.\nRepublican presidential contender Donald Trump is looking to close the deal with Iowa's evangelical Christian voters on the last day before they caucus.\nTrump attended services at the First Christian Orchard Campus, a nondenominational church in Council Bluffs.\nHe, his wife, Melania, and two staffers took communion when it was passed. But Trump, momentarily confused, mistook the silver plates circulated around the auditorium and dug several bills out of his pocket.\n\"I thought it was for offering,\" he said with a laugh to his staff.\nHe contributed several minutes later when the offering plates were passed.\nAs Trump was leaving one of the church pastors put his hand on Trump's shoulder and offered a prayer, \"That Jesus would guide his decisions and that only Christ could guide his decisions,\" the pastor later said.\nTrump gladly accepted, bowing his head.\n\"Thank you, I need that,\" he said.\n___\n1:10 p.m.\nThe chief super PAC helping Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio raised more than $30 million last year, half of it in the last six months.\nConservative Solutions PAC shared its fundraising numbers ahead of a required filing Sunday with federal regulators.\nBillionaire New York investor Paul Singer gave $2.5 million, making him one of Rubio's most generous supporters. In October, Singer wrote a letter to his friends encouraging them to back Rubio in the primary contests. Chicago-based investor Ken Griffin also gave $2.5 million shortly after announcing his support for Rubio in December.\nOther seven-figure contributors include Florida auto dealer and longtime Rubio booster Norman Braman, financier Cliff Asness of New York and roofing company executive David Humphreys of Missouri.\nConservative Solutions PAC began the year with about $14 million left to spend.\n___\n12:44 p.m.\nOn a day when presidential candidates report their fundraising totals for 2015 to federal regulators, Democratic contender Bernie Sanders is going a step further. His campaign says it raised more than $20 million this month.\nThat means his pace is picking up. Earlier, his campaign said it raised $33 million over the last three months of 2015, compared to $37 million for Hillary Clinton's campaign in the same time period.\nClinton's campaign did not immediately respond to a question about its January fundraising.\n___\n12:20 p.m.\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio is upbeat entering the final stretch of his Iowa campaign, while trying to stay realistic about the outcome of Monday's contest.\nDuring an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Rubio built expectations for rival Sen. Ted Cruz as \"clearly the front-runner,\" while trying to trim his own prospects the day before the caucuses.\nA Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll of likely Republican caucus goers published Saturday showed Cruz trailing billionaire Donald Trump and Rubio in solid third.\nRubio is wrapping up a nine-day blitz of Iowa on Sunday with events in Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids and Davenport.\nRubio tells CBS: \"The crowds are growing. The people signing up are growing. Our campaign structure feels good about it...We'll have a strong showing on Monday night.\"\n___\n11:30 a. m.\nEven at church, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz can't escape politics.\nThe Texas senator attended services Sunday morning at Lutheran Church of Hope outside Des Moines. The sermon by pastor Mike Housholder called on politicians to treat their opponents with love, not attack ads.\nHousholder preached that speaking the truth with love is a better way to treat others. He says if you can't do that, don't speak.\nCruz attended the service with his wife, Heidi, and their two daughters. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley was also there but did not sit by Cruz.\nHousholder said after the service he wrote the sermon before he found out the Texas senator would attend and did not tailor it to him.\nCruz greeted parishioners, shook hands and took pictures before departing for his first campaign stop of the day in Iowa City.\n__\n11:20 a.m.\nEven the candidate who says he's the best, the smartest and the highest-energy in the Republican field is leaving nothing to chance a day out from the Iowa caucuses.\nAttendees at Donald Trump's event in Dubuque Saturday night awakened to an email from his Iowa political director, Chuck Laudner, personally thanking them for coming.\nAnd urging them to caucus.\n\"It is extremely important that you get out there and VOTE for Mr. Trump,\" Laudner wrote. Not sure where? Laudner includes a special tool \"to make this process as easy, and fun, as possible\"  the \"Republican Iowa Caucus Finder.\"\nClick the link and enter a home address and the finder will \"tell you the correct place to show up on caucus night so that you can help elect Donald Trump!\"\n___\n8:59 a.m.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says the hubbub over whether she had secret emails on her server is \"very much like Benghazi,\" a politically motivated scandal that's likely not as serious as Republicans suggest.\nClinton told ABC's \"This Week\" that \"it's pretty clear\" that Republicans are \"grasping at straws\" in their response to the latest release of emails from Clinton's private home server. The State Department announced it's withholding some of those emails because the information they contain is too highly classified. The former secretary of state says she's been told some of that email correspondence included a public newspaper article. Clinton insists she never sent or received information on her personal email account that was classified at the time. She repeated her call for the emails' release.\nAs secretary of state, Clinton presided over a key piece of the government's response to the deadly 2012 assaults on a diplomatic compound and CIA quarters in Benghazi, Libya. The attacks killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and quickly became a political rallying cry for Republicans.\n___\n8:40 a.m.\nRepublican presidential contender Donald Trump says \"many\" senators will endorse his candidacy, \"very soon.\"\nTrump tells on ABC's \"This Week\" that members of the Senate will choose him over their own colleague, Sen. Ted Cruz, who is also Trump's top rival in Iowa. Trump did not offer any senators' names.\nTrump says Cruz is \"a nasty guy\" and a \"liar,\" particularly about whether Trump essentially supports President Barack Obama's signature national health care program. Trump says he would replace that law and make other deals that would accomplish his public policy goals.\nCruz says the nation doesn't need a deal-maker, it needs a \"fighter\" for conservative causes.\n___\n8:30 a.m.\nBernie Sanders says he's ready to turn the political world upside down in Iowa.\nThe Democratic presidential candidate says that if his supporters turn out in large numbers for Monday night's caucuses, \"I think you're going to look at one of the biggest political upsets in the modern history of our country.\"\nThe Vermont senator is in a tight race with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nSanders tells CNN's \"State of the Union\" that his campaign has gotten lots of people involved in politics who hadn't been before. He mentions the working class as well as young people who no longer \"want to sit back\" but want to help direct their country's future.\n___\n7:45 a.m.\nDonald Trump isn't shy about boasting, but the Republican presidential front-runner says he also has a humble side.\nHere's what he tells CBS' \" Face the Nation\" in an interview: \"We're all the same. I mean, we're all going to the same place, probably one of two places, you know? But we're all the same.  And I do have, actually, much more humility than a lot of people would think.\"\nAsked about hiding that side, the billionaire businessman says, \"I'd rather not play my cards. I want to be unpredictable.\"\nOne thing he's not lacking is confidence. In the interview, he said \"none of the other guys will win.\"","gunning_fog_1":"8.8","flesch_1":"8.7","readability_1":"62.68","index_2":"59","title_2":"Cruz to tea party supporters: Don't get 'burned' by fake conservatives","url_2":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/ted-cruz-tea-party-rally-donald-trump-marco-rubio/index.html","candidate_2":"Ted Cruz","org_2":"CNN","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (CNN) Ted Cruz implored a Tea Party audience here on Saturday to examine closely the record of candidates like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, warning a crowd not to get \"burned\" by fake brothers in arms even as he declined to utter his rivals' names.\nThe Texas senator typically asks audiences to distinguish between \"campaign conservatives\" and \"consistent conservatives,\" but Cruz's remarks Saturday were essentially a dare to those gathered here to look finely at opponents' histories on seven key battles. In a retooled stump speech flush with Trump overtones and delivered right before Trump took the stage himself, Cruz offered a checklist of fights that he had led that his opponents -- like Trump -- hadn't.\n \n\"How many people here have been burned by politicians?\" Cruz asked the crowd, hours after Cruz bashed Trump's record as more liberal than conservative. \"The stakes in 2016 have never been higher. Our country is hanging in the balance. So I've got a very simple question for the folks here: How do we not get burned again?\"\nCruz then listed off seven fights he had led, describing each as a \"time for choosing,\" a reference to Ronald Reagan's iconic 1964 speech: fighting for gun rights, traditional marriage, defunding Planned Parenthood, fighting against Obamacare, a nuclear Iran, \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants and government intervention for Wall Street and other favored industries.\n\"If someone tells you they're tea party, you can't be tea party and at the same time have supported TARP,\" Cruz said, using an acronym for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a controversial Wall Street bailout program. \"You can't be tea party and at the same time have supported Barack Obama's stimulus. You cant be tea party and at the same time support the ethanol mandate because it's good politics in Iowa and support the sugar subsidies because it's good politics in Florida.\"\nTrump is one of several candidates who support the Iowa ethanol mandate, and Rubio has advocated for his home state's subsidies. Cruz made sure to knock Republican candidates like Rubio who Cruz sees as insufficiently tough on immigration -- which is also one of Trump's signature issues.\n\"Anybody who was AWOL from the battle on the Gang of Eight has no standing as a candidate now to say they will enforce the border,\" Cruz said of the comprehensive immigration bill pushed by Rubio in 2013.\nTrump, for his part, backed off from his criticisms of Cruz that he had broadcast loudly all day on Saturday. During a 45-minute speech here, Trump left Cruz unscathed until the very end, when he mentioned the loans that Cruz received as a Senate candidate in 2012 but did not properly report to election authorities.\n \nAnd when Trump did finally mention Cruz's name, he appeared rattled after the tea party crowd loudly booed him. \n\"You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want,\" he said, the boos beginning. \"He's got bank loans from Goldman Sachs, he's got bank loans from Citibank -- and then he acts like Robin Hood?\"\nCruz, who suddenly has started criticizing Trump after seven months of refusing to do so, essentially offered South Carolina voters a roadmap to vet him. \n\"When someone announces as a Republican candidate for president, suddenly they agree with the values of everyone in this room,\" Cruz said. \"If they haven't been willing to stand and lead, you can know to an absolute fact they wouldn't do so as president either.\"","gunning_fog_2":"12.0","flesch_2":"11.9","readability_2":"54.56","index_3":"111","title_3":"First Draft: Hispanic Celebrities Denounce Donald Trump and G.O.P.

In his home state, Cruz often comes across as a rock star, a leader so admired by the grassroots that his endorsement in legislative primaries is the closest thing to a gold standard in state politics.\nBut thanks to Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, Cruz's shot at becoming President may end in Texas.\nCruz, despite his appeal as a native son ideologically in sync with a ruby red Republican base, could very well lose the Texas primary next week, a setback that would strike at the core of Cruz's southern political strategy. \nBoth Trump and Rubio are squeezing Cruz in the Lone Star State, cutting into his lead by blanketing the airwaves and working side by side to engineer an upset. Trump continues to hit Cruz with claims the senator is a \"liar,\" and Rubio wants to show he can win establishment and anti-Trump votes, which means taking from Cruz.\nNightcap: Mitt Romney predicts a 'bombshell' in Donald Trump's taxes | Sign up\nCruz aides remain optimistic that he can still compete elsewhere on Super Tuesday, but they have nevertheless sent stakes for his performance back on his home turf to new heights.\n\"This is make or break for Cruz. He has to win -- no close second is good enough,\" said Bill Miller, an unaligned, senior Republican lobbyist here. \"Unquestionably he's favored -- and it has been in the bag -- but the bag has a weak bottom.\"\nMost political observers still give Cruz the slight upper hand and expect him to claim the plurality of the state's 155 delegates, which his team believes can put him close to even in the delegate race after March 1. \nAnd Cruz certainly is not taking Texas for granted -- working the state's political machinery since the moment he announced and on Wednesday rolling out his highest-ranking endorsement yet anywhere in the country, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\nThe question, however, is whether of any of that will be able to stop the freight train of momentum that is Trump, who is planning a huge rally in Fort Worth on Friday morning.\n\"Most people are just listening to the message, and they're not necessarily going to have loyalty toward Cruz just because he's our current senator,\" said Wayne Richard, a Dallas-area activist supporting Trump. Richard acknowledged Cruz's strong field program, but was skeptical it would make much of a difference and that Texas could have a \"devastating impact\" on Cruz's White House hopes.\nRecent polling has shown Cruz with a solid, but not insurmountable lead over Trump. A Monmouth University survey released Thursday gave Cruz a particularly wide margin, putting him 15 points above Trump. And Cruz's vaunted ground game numbers 27,000 volunteers, which observers say gives Cruz even more of an edge. \nCruz is doing virtually nothing to tamp down expectations. On Tuesday, he called March 1 \"the single most important day in this presidential election.\"\n\nBut it's not just Trump that poses a threat: Cruz is also confronting an increasingly dangerous Rubio, whose campaign would like nothing more than to kneecap their arch-rival in his home state. \nThe Florida senator's super PAC has made its largest investment on Super Tuesday in Cruz's home state, sinking millions of dollars into territory it might not win with the hopes of embarrassing the candidate who really needs it.\nRubio also stands to benefit from the Bush bundler network, which is particularly deep in this town, migrating over into his camp.\n\"Rubio or bust,\" said Jacob Monty, a former Bush fundraiser here. \"No one from Bush has gone anywhere but Rubio. Rubio is the only hope for rational Republicans who would like to win the general.\"\nMonty, like other Latino Republican leaders in Houston, have also gravitated to Rubio. He was introduced at a rally in a hotel ballroom Wednesday afternoon by two of the country's most prominent Hispanic Republicans, and his crowd was more solidly Latino than most Cruz crowds.\n \n\"You're from Texas,\" Rubio told his supporters when someone interrupted him to shout something in Spanish. \"You know what he said.\"\nRubio's team recognizes it is unlikely to win as many delegates in Texas. But although some of Texas' 155 delegates are awarded statewide, most are distributed via congressional district: a candidate who earns more than 50% in one of the state's districts wins all three delegates in the district, and anyone who earns below 20% wins zero. So if Rubio's camp can surgically target Cruz and minimize his vote percentage in key districts, they can keep him from building a delegate lead on Super Tuesday.\n\"You can get nowhere near first place in Texas and still vacuum up a whole lot of delegates just because of the size of the state,\" said Todd Harris, Rubio's chief strategist. \"We're under no illusions that there won't be a resounding Ted Cruz victory, but there are things that we think we can do on the margins to sweep up some delegates -- and we're going to do it.\"\n\nCruz received a hometown hero's welcome at the Lincoln Reagan Dinner on Wednesday evening, where his stickers firmly stuck to guests' blazers.\nThat dominance wasn't always a sure thing.\nA year ago at this same dinner, the question in this city in the pre-Trump era was which of the men who have called it home would emerge victorious: Would it be Jeb Bush, whose father remains revered here by both Democrats and Republicans alike? Rick Perry, the powerful, 14-year governor? Rand Paul, who grew up in a nearby suburb? Or Cruz, who headquartered his campaign not far from his condominium? \nOr maybe an outsider: Scott Walker, who wowed as a keynote speaker here eleven months ago with odes to Reagan and who Abbott said governed \"like a Texan\" in Wisconsin.\nThe threat to Cruz has indeed been an outsider, but one that no one in this booming oil city saw coming.\nSo in the final days of the Texas primary, Cruz is looking to remind them of their shared roots. As he collected Abbott's endorsement in a factory on Wednesday afternoon, Cruz's rhetoric was awash with Texas pride and symbolism, calling on his constituents to cast aside their fascination with the New Yorker they love and vote for the Texan they know.\n\"We are not a people who are impressed by a lot of blustery rhetoric that's not backed up by truth,\" Cruz said. \"We can't be fooled by P.T. Barnum. The time for the clowns and the acrobats and the dancing bears has passed.\"","gunning_fog_4":"11.2","flesch_4":"11.1","readability_4":"56.59","index_5":"17","title_5":"First Draft: F.E.C.

That can be harder when donors use slightly different variations of their names or contribute from more than one address. Mr. Sanders’s campaign may choose to refund the excess contributions or re-designate the excess for use in a general election campaign, when candidates can accept another $2,700.\n\nBut the F.E.C.’s review suggests that the sheer volume of small contributions Mr. Sanders is receiving — more than 3 million of them so far, according to his campaign — may be straining his campaign’s ability to keep track of which donors are which. Most of the contributions cited by the commission were given by donors with relatively unusual names, whose small checks are generally easier to tally.\n\nIn early February, after the end of the fourth fund-raising quarter, Mr. Sanders’s campaign announced that it had more than 1.3 million donors, an astonishing number for so early in the campaign cycle. And last week, the campaign announced it had received 3.25 million total donations, the most of any presidential candidate in the race. The campaign’s most recent F.E.C. filing was nearly 100,000 pages long.\n\nIn an e-mail, Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said, “We are looking into the F.E.C. staff questions and are committed to full and accurate disclosure of the tremendous grass-roots support for Sen. Sanders from people all across America.”","gunning_fog_5":"8.0","flesch_5":"9.1","readability_5":"56.25","gold_title":"Ted Cruz for President","gold_url":"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432682/ted-cruz-national-review-endorses-texas-senator-president","gold_candidate":"Ted Cruz","gold_org":"The National Review","gold_body":"Conservatives have had difficulty choosing a champion in the presidential race in part because it has featured so many candidates with very good claims on our support. As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also Republicans’ best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles. We support Ted Cruz for president."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5596330275229358},"q1":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5596330275229358},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5596330275229358},"q4":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5596330275229358},"q5":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q6":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.4403669724770643},"q7":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.4403669724770643},"q8":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.743119266055046},"q9":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.743119266055046},"q10":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5596330275229358},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":0.6972477064220183},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":0.743119266055046},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"republican","confidence":0.4403669724770643},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"ted_cruz","confidence":0.4403669724770643}}}

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"\nClinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. \nIn Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. \nThe secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. \n\"So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,\" said Sherman. \"To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.\"\nThe Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.\nPrevious email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. \nThe State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. \nThe conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,\" so it was born classified when the emails were created. \n\"Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,\" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. \"This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.\"\nA Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. \nThe polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important. \n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

The so-called Hyde Amendment, passed in 1976, is the long-standing compromise between pro-life and pro-choice lawmakers that restricts federally funded abortion cases only to those of rape, incest and life of the mother. Over time, this has grown to include government health programs like Medicaid and Obamacare.

Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN’s Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump. … Cruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on ‘State of the Union’ that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S. ‘No, I don’t intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That’s not how we enforce the law for any crime,’ Cruz [said.]”\n\nTrump’s new birther gusto - WaPo: “After days of coyly raising questions about Ted Cruz’s eligibility to be president, given that he was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father, Donald Trump let his audience weigh in at a rally Sunday afternoon. ‘Is he a natural-born citizen?’ the Republican White House hopeful asked several thousand gathered in a Reno ballroom. Members of the crowd shouted back, ‘No!’ ‘I don’t know,’ Trump said. ‘Honestly, we don’t know. Who the hell knows.’ Cruz was Trump’s No. 1 target during the 65-minute event, revealing just how much of a threat the Republican senator from Texas has become to the front-runner. Before the rally started, Bruce Springsteen's ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ blared, a new edition to Trump’s playlist.”\n\nTrump signs Huntsman group’s pledge - AP: “No Labels, formed after the 2010 midterm elections, is asking candidates to embrace four broad goals related to job creation, the federal budget, energy independence and entitlements, promote them in the campaign and promise to work with a bipartisan group in Congress on at least one of them within 30 days of taking office…On Monday, the group’s leaders are announcing the six who stepped up: Democrat Martin O'Malley, and Republicans Ben Carson, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rand Paul and Donald Trump.”\n\nABC drops debate partner at Trump’s behest - WFXT: “Donald Trump announced Sunday that he had the New Hampshire Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate on Feb. 6. Politico reports that ABC cut their partnership with the paper, the largest newspaper in New Hampshire, a source citing a strained relationship, caused by the front page editorials about Donald Trump. Trump is taking credit for the end of the relationship, saying the paper’s behavior has been ‘highly unethical’ and it has endorsed a candidate who can’t win. On Nov. 28, the paper endorsed Gov. Chris Christie.”\n\nRubio makes major ad push in Iowa - DMR: “Marco Rubio is poised to dominate Iowa’s television airwaves with about 7,000 ads scheduled to run from Jan. 1 until caucus day — an effort that accounts for more than one-third of all political ads slated to air during that time. The purchases on Rubio's behalf make up more than half of the $9.4 million in total spending for ads that are scheduled to air across the state during the final month of the caucus campaign.”\n\nDespite past quotes, Christie denies Planned Parenthood donations - WSJ: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied Sunday that he has given money to Planned Parenthood, hitting back at a claim by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. ‘I never donated to Planned Parenthood,’ Mr. Christie told CBS on Face the Nation…On Fox Business last week, Mr. Rubio highlighted positions that he said aligned Mr. Christie with President Barack Obama [including Planned Parenthood donations]…A 2012 book on the governor – ‘Chris Christie: The Inside Story of His Rise to Power’ — recalls an incident in the mid-90s where Mr. Christie opposed county funding for Planned Parenthood on financial grounds, even though he said he supported it ideologically. ‘I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution,’ he said, according to the book. When asked about the apparent conflict with the statement from decades ago, a Christie spokeswoman said: ‘The governor didn’t donate to Planned Parenthood.’”\n\nPOWER PLAY: IOWA INTRICACIES\nAs Donald Trump continues to dig into Ted Cruz, the competition for Iowa is kicking into high gear.

A similar ad with a different ending will be shown in New Hampshire.\n\nOpening on the White House, the ad shows a sweltering industrial plant, a fighter taking off from an aircraft carrier and a family of four sitting down to dinner. “The person who lives here,” a male narrator intones, “has to solve problems as big as the world and as small as your kitchen table.”\n\nViewers are taken on a quick tour of Mrs. Clinton’s extended career in public service: surrounded by children as first lady, when she “helped get health care for eight million kids”; as a senator from New York, standing grim-faced in a trench coat amid the debris at ground zero, where, the ad says, she “helped a city rise again”; and speaking soberly to an attentive President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as the voice-over says she has “stared down hostile leaders around the world.” She is seen on the campaign trail and in the Situation Room with President Obama as the ad calls her the “one candidate for president who has everything it takes to do every part of the job.”\n\nThe ad rattles off Mrs. Clinton’s touchstone promises: to defend Social Security and Medicare against privatization, protect Planned Parenthood from shutdown, “take on the gun lobby” and “finally get equal pay for women.” Clips of a shouting Donald J. Trump and of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas aiming an assault weapon at a gun range symbolize the threat as the narrator says Mrs. Clinton will “stop the Republicans from ripping all our progress away.”\n\nIt closes with Mrs. Clinton, back in October, assuring Iowa Democrats, “I’m listening to you, I’m fighting for you, and with your support, I’m going to deliver,” as viewers are urged to “caucus for Hillary.”\n\nAn entire candidacy boiled down to a minute. With its heavy focus on foreign policy and experience in a crisis, the ad plays up ways in which Mrs. Clinton’s résumé compares favorably with that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her unnamed Democratic rival. The references to gun control offer a reminder of her recent attacks on Mr. Sanders’s record on that issue. And she returns to women’s rights, on which she began her campaign. To “keep America safe and build a stronger economy,” the ad sums up, “Hillary’s the choice.”\n\nIn 2008, Mrs. Clinton was criticized for what some saw as an overstatement of her role in enacting the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. But this ad gets it right: She was a driving force on the bill within her husband’s administration, aiding the efforts of Edward M. Kennedy and others who led the fight for it in the Senate.\n\nIowa broadcast markets.\n\nIt feels as if it’s much longer than 60 seconds, and that is a good thing: The ad seeks to give Mrs. Clinton’s strengths the feeling of overwhelming force while conveying that only she has what it takes to meet the demands of the presidency and to defend what Democrats hold dear.","gunning_fog_5":"9.2","flesch_5":"7.9","readability_5":"70.13","gold_title":"The Seattle Times editorial board recommends John Kasich, Bernie Sanders","gold_url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-seattle-times-editorial-board-recommends-john-kasich-bernie-sanders/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Seattle Times","gold_body":"Authenticity and consistency are so rare in politics these days — no wonder a strong number of voters are supporting U.S. Sen.

He has long warned about the dangers of media consolidation, which limits the range of information citizens need to maintain a strong democracy.\n\nOverall, Sanders is not as politically experienced as Hillary Clinton, who knows the ropes in both the executive and legislative branches.

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"\nClinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. \nIn Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. \nThe secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. \n\"So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,\" said Sherman. \"To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.\"\nThe Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.\nPrevious email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. \nThe State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. \nThe conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,\" so it was born classified when the emails were created. \n\"Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,\" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. \"This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.\"\nA Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. \nThe polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important. \n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

The so-called Hyde Amendment, passed in 1976, is the long-standing compromise between pro-life and pro-choice lawmakers that restricts federally funded abortion cases only to those of rape, incest and life of the mother. Over time, this has grown to include government health programs like Medicaid and Obamacare. At the rally, Clinton said she believes Planned Parenthood, America’s largest abortion provider, should be “fully funded” citing that the measure discriminates against low-income women. The group took in over $500 million from taxpayers in 2014 for non-abortion activities.\n\nSanders strengthens in Iowa, N.H. - WSJ: “ Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are deadlocked in both Iowa and New Hampshire three weeks before voting begins in the 2016 presidential race, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds.

Is he probably just Huntsmaning? Yes. Would that be consequential? Yes.\n\nState and national polling shows that the third coming of Chris Christie is not upon us. After weeks of media speculation that the long-dormant chances of the New Jersey governor were going erupt in a riot of electoral possibilities, there’s no evidence of it.\n\nSame goes for Jeb Bush, whose remaining loyalists say is now eying South Carolina as his real last stand. Bless his heart.\n\nThe name of the game for Kasich, Christie and Bush is to beat Marco Rubio. Anywhere. Anyhow. He runs best against Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups and, booties or not, seems to be starting to solidify his place.\n\nNew Hampshire, with a primary open to Democrats and independents, and an electorate more liberal and secular than the rest of the early voting-states presents the best chance to knock down Rubio.\n\nAside from an iron-clad consistency that Christie seems to lack and an energy that Bush cannot bring, Kasich is also the kind of Republican that attracts Democrats. Like Trump, he has true crossover appeal.\n\nWhile Rubio has been sparring with Christie and Bush, he may fight his last round in New Hampshire with Kasich.\n\n1) Ted Cruz; 2) Marco Rubio; 3) Donald Trump; 4) Jeb Bush [+1]; 5) Chris Christie [-1]; 6) John Kasich [previously unranked]\n\nOn the radar - Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Rand Paul\n\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins “The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\n\nWhat would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN’s Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump. … Cruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on ‘State of the Union’ that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S. ‘No, I don’t intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That’s not how we enforce the law for any crime,’ Cruz [said.]”\n\nTrump’s new birther gusto - WaPo: “After days of coyly raising questions about Ted Cruz’s eligibility to be president, given that he was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father, Donald Trump let his audience weigh in at a rally Sunday afternoon. ‘Is he a natural-born citizen?’ the Republican White House hopeful asked several thousand gathered in a Reno ballroom. Members of the crowd shouted back, ‘No!’ ‘I don’t know,’ Trump said. ‘Honestly, we don’t know. Who the hell knows.’ Cruz was Trump’s No. 1 target during the 65-minute event, revealing just how much of a threat the Republican senator from Texas has become to the front-runner. Before the rally started, Bruce Springsteen's ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ blared, a new edition to Trump’s playlist.”\n\nTrump signs Huntsman group’s pledge - AP: “No Labels, formed after the 2010 midterm elections, is asking candidates to embrace four broad goals related to job creation, the federal budget, energy independence and entitlements, promote them in the campaign and promise to work with a bipartisan group in Congress on at least one of them within 30 days of taking office…On Monday, the group’s leaders are announcing the six who stepped up: Democrat Martin O'Malley, and Republicans Ben Carson, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rand Paul and Donald Trump.”\n\nABC drops debate partner at Trump’s behest - WFXT: “Donald Trump announced Sunday that he had the New Hampshire Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate on Feb. 6. Politico reports that ABC cut their partnership with the paper, the largest newspaper in New Hampshire, a source citing a strained relationship, caused by the front page editorials about Donald Trump. Trump is taking credit for the end of the relationship, saying the paper’s behavior has been ‘highly unethical’ and it has endorsed a candidate who can’t win. On Nov. 28, the paper endorsed Gov. Chris Christie.”\n\nRubio makes major ad push in Iowa - DMR: “Marco Rubio is poised to dominate Iowa’s television airwaves with about 7,000 ads scheduled to run from Jan. 1 until caucus day — an effort that accounts for more than one-third of all political ads slated to air during that time. The purchases on Rubio's behalf make up more than half of the $9.4 million in total spending for ads that are scheduled to air across the state during the final month of the caucus campaign.”\n\nDespite past quotes, Christie denies Planned Parenthood donations - WSJ: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied Sunday that he has given money to Planned Parenthood, hitting back at a claim by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. ‘I never donated to Planned Parenthood,’ Mr. Christie told CBS on Face the Nation…On Fox Business last week, Mr. Rubio highlighted positions that he said aligned Mr. Christie with President Barack Obama [including Planned Parenthood donations]…A 2012 book on the governor – ‘Chris Christie: The Inside Story of His Rise to Power’ — recalls an incident in the mid-90s where Mr. Christie opposed county funding for Planned Parenthood on financial grounds, even though he said he supported it ideologically. ‘I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution,’ he said, according to the book. When asked about the apparent conflict with the statement from decades ago, a Christie spokeswoman said: ‘The governor didn’t donate to Planned Parenthood.’”\n\nPOWER PLAY: IOWA INTRICACIES\nAs Donald Trump continues to dig into Ted Cruz, the competition for Iowa is kicking into high gear. But a caucus is a lot more involved than going to the polling booth and checking a ballot. Will the attacks incentivize Trump supporters to caucus for him?

A similar ad with a different ending will be shown in New Hampshire.\n\nOpening on the White House, the ad shows a sweltering industrial plant, a fighter taking off from an aircraft carrier and a family of four sitting down to dinner. “The person who lives here,” a male narrator intones, “has to solve problems as big as the world and as small as your kitchen table.”\n\nViewers are taken on a quick tour of Mrs. Clinton’s extended career in public service: surrounded by children as first lady, when she “helped get health care for eight million kids”; as a senator from New York, standing grim-faced in a trench coat amid the debris at ground zero, where, the ad says, she “helped a city rise again”; and speaking soberly to an attentive President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as the voice-over says she has “stared down hostile leaders around the world.” She is seen on the campaign trail and in the Situation Room with President Obama as the ad calls her the “one candidate for president who has everything it takes to do every part of the job.”\n\nThe ad rattles off Mrs. Clinton’s touchstone promises: to defend Social Security and Medicare against privatization, protect Planned Parenthood from shutdown, “take on the gun lobby” and “finally get equal pay for women.” Clips of a shouting Donald J. Trump and of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas aiming an assault weapon at a gun range symbolize the threat as the narrator says Mrs. Clinton will “stop the Republicans from ripping all our progress away.”\n\nIt closes with Mrs. Clinton, back in October, assuring Iowa Democrats, “I’m listening to you, I’m fighting for you, and with your support, I’m going to deliver,” as viewers are urged to “caucus for Hillary.”\n\nAn entire candidacy boiled down to a minute. With its heavy focus on foreign policy and experience in a crisis, the ad plays up ways in which Mrs. Clinton’s résumé compares favorably with that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her unnamed Democratic rival. The references to gun control offer a reminder of her recent attacks on Mr. Sanders’s record on that issue. And she returns to women’s rights, on which she began her campaign. To “keep America safe and build a stronger economy,” the ad sums up, “Hillary’s the choice.”\n\nIn 2008, Mrs. Clinton was criticized for what some saw as an overstatement of her role in enacting the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. But this ad gets it right: She was a driving force on the bill within her husband’s administration, aiding the efforts of Edward M. Kennedy and others who led the fight for it in the Senate.\n\nIowa broadcast markets.\n\nIt feels as if it’s much longer than 60 seconds, and that is a good thing: The ad seeks to give Mrs. Clinton’s strengths the feeling of overwhelming force while conveying that only she has what it takes to meet the demands of the presidency and to defend what Democrats hold dear.","gunning_fog_5":"9.2","flesch_5":"7.9","readability_5":"70.13","gold_title":"The Seattle Times editorial board recommends John Kasich, Bernie Sanders","gold_url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-seattle-times-editorial-board-recommends-john-kasich-bernie-sanders/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Seattle Times","gold_body":"Authenticity and consistency are so rare in politics these days — no wonder a strong number of voters are supporting U.S. Sen.

Is he probably just Huntsmaning? Yes. Would that be consequential? Yes.\n\nState and national polling shows that the third coming of Chris Christie is not upon us. After weeks of media speculation that the long-dormant chances of the New Jersey governor were going erupt in a riot of electoral possibilities, there’s no evidence of it.\n\nSame goes for Jeb Bush, whose remaining loyalists say is now eying South Carolina as his real last stand. Bless his heart.\n\nThe name of the game for Kasich, Christie and Bush is to beat Marco Rubio. Anywhere. Anyhow. He runs best against Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups and, booties or not, seems to be starting to solidify his place.\n\nNew Hampshire, with a primary open to Democrats and independents, and an electorate more liberal and secular than the rest of the early voting-states presents the best chance to knock down Rubio.\n\nAside from an iron-clad consistency that Christie seems to lack and an energy that Bush cannot bring, Kasich is also the kind of Republican that attracts Democrats. Like Trump, he has true crossover appeal.\n\nWhile Rubio has been sparring with Christie and Bush, he may fight his last round in New Hampshire with Kasich.\n\n1) Ted Cruz; 2) Marco Rubio; 3) Donald Trump; 4) Jeb Bush [+1]; 5) Chris Christie [-1]; 6) John Kasich [previously unranked]\n\nOn the radar - Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Rand Paul\n\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins “The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\n\nWhat would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN’s Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump. … Cruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on ‘State of the Union’ that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S. ‘No, I don’t intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That’s not how we enforce the law for any crime,’ Cruz [said.]”\n\nTrump’s new birther gusto - WaPo: “After days of coyly raising questions about Ted Cruz’s eligibility to be president, given that he was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father, Donald Trump let his audience weigh in at a rally Sunday afternoon. ‘Is he a natural-born citizen?’ the Republican White House hopeful asked several thousand gathered in a Reno ballroom. Members of the crowd shouted back, ‘No!’ ‘I don’t know,’ Trump said. ‘Honestly, we don’t know. Who the hell knows.’ Cruz was Trump’s No. 1 target during the 65-minute event, revealing just how much of a threat the Republican senator from Texas has become to the front-runner. Before the rally started, Bruce Springsteen's ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ blared, a new edition to Trump’s playlist.”\n\nTrump signs Huntsman group’s pledge - AP: “No Labels, formed after the 2010 midterm elections, is asking candidates to embrace four broad goals related to job creation, the federal budget, energy independence and entitlements, promote them in the campaign and promise to work with a bipartisan group in Congress on at least one of them within 30 days of taking office…On Monday, the group’s leaders are announcing the six who stepped up: Democrat Martin O'Malley, and Republicans Ben Carson, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rand Paul and Donald Trump.”\n\nABC drops debate partner at Trump’s behest - WFXT: “Donald Trump announced Sunday that he had the New Hampshire Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate on Feb. 6. Politico reports that ABC cut their partnership with the paper, the largest newspaper in New Hampshire, a source citing a strained relationship, caused by the front page editorials about Donald Trump. Trump is taking credit for the end of the relationship, saying the paper’s behavior has been ‘highly unethical’ and it has endorsed a candidate who can’t win. On Nov. 28, the paper endorsed Gov. Chris Christie.”\n\nRubio makes major ad push in Iowa - DMR: “Marco Rubio is poised to dominate Iowa’s television airwaves with about 7,000 ads scheduled to run from Jan. 1 until caucus day — an effort that accounts for more than one-third of all political ads slated to air during that time. The purchases on Rubio's behalf make up more than half of the $9.4 million in total spending for ads that are scheduled to air across the state during the final month of the caucus campaign.”\n\nDespite past quotes, Christie denies Planned Parenthood donations - WSJ: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied Sunday that he has given money to Planned Parenthood, hitting back at a claim by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. ‘I never donated to Planned Parenthood,’ Mr. Christie told CBS on Face the Nation…On Fox Business last week, Mr. Rubio highlighted positions that he said aligned Mr. Christie with President Barack Obama [including Planned Parenthood donations]…A 2012 book on the governor – ‘Chris Christie: The Inside Story of His Rise to Power’ — recalls an incident in the mid-90s where Mr. Christie opposed county funding for Planned Parenthood on financial grounds, even though he said he supported it ideologically. ‘I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution,’ he said, according to the book. When asked about the apparent conflict with the statement from decades ago, a Christie spokeswoman said: ‘The governor didn’t donate to Planned Parenthood.’”\n\nPOWER PLAY: IOWA INTRICACIES\nAs Donald Trump continues to dig into Ted Cruz, the competition for Iowa is kicking into high gear.

A similar ad with a different ending will be shown in New Hampshire.\n\nOpening on the White House, the ad shows a sweltering industrial plant, a fighter taking off from an aircraft carrier and a family of four sitting down to dinner. “The person who lives here,” a male narrator intones, “has to solve problems as big as the world and as small as your kitchen table.”\n\nViewers are taken on a quick tour of Mrs. Clinton’s extended career in public service: surrounded by children as first lady, when she “helped get health care for eight million kids”; as a senator from New York, standing grim-faced in a trench coat amid the debris at ground zero, where, the ad says, she “helped a city rise again”; and speaking soberly to an attentive President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as the voice-over says she has “stared down hostile leaders around the world.” She is seen on the campaign trail and in the Situation Room with President Obama as the ad calls her the “one candidate for president who has everything it takes to do every part of the job.”\n\nThe ad rattles off Mrs. Clinton’s touchstone promises: to defend Social Security and Medicare against privatization, protect Planned Parenthood from shutdown, “take on the gun lobby” and “finally get equal pay for women.” Clips of a shouting Donald J. Trump and of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas aiming an assault weapon at a gun range symbolize the threat as the narrator says Mrs. Clinton will “stop the Republicans from ripping all our progress away.”\n\nIt closes with Mrs. Clinton, back in October, assuring Iowa Democrats, “I’m listening to you, I’m fighting for you, and with your support, I’m going to deliver,” as viewers are urged to “caucus for Hillary.”\n\nAn entire candidacy boiled down to a minute. With its heavy focus on foreign policy and experience in a crisis, the ad plays up ways in which Mrs. Clinton’s résumé compares favorably with that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her unnamed Democratic rival. The references to gun control offer a reminder of her recent attacks on Mr. Sanders’s record on that issue. And she returns to women’s rights, on which she began her campaign. To “keep America safe and build a stronger economy,” the ad sums up, “Hillary’s the choice.”\n\nIn 2008, Mrs. Clinton was criticized for what some saw as an overstatement of her role in enacting the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. But this ad gets it right: She was a driving force on the bill within her husband’s administration, aiding the efforts of Edward M. Kennedy and others who led the fight for it in the Senate.\n\nIowa broadcast markets.\n\nIt feels as if it’s much longer than 60 seconds, and that is a good thing: The ad seeks to give Mrs. Clinton’s strengths the feeling of overwhelming force while conveying that only she has what it takes to meet the demands of the presidency and to defend what Democrats hold dear.","gunning_fog_5":"9.2","flesch_5":"7.9","readability_5":"70.13","gold_title":"The Seattle Times editorial board recommends John Kasich, Bernie Sanders","gold_url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-seattle-times-editorial-board-recommends-john-kasich-bernie-sanders/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Seattle Times","gold_body":"Authenticity and consistency are so rare in politics these days — no wonder a strong number of voters are supporting U.S. Sen.

So, whatever information can appropriately be transmitted unclassified often was...’ Mrs. Clinton said Sunday that the request to her staffer didn’t amount to an order to violate laws on handling classified material, and said the email was never sent in any case.”\n\nHillary calls for taxpayer funding of abortions - At a Planned Parenthood endorsement rally for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee called for an end to the 40-year-old ban on taxpayer funds for abortion. The so-called Hyde Amendment, passed in 1976, is the long-standing compromise between pro-life and pro-choice lawmakers that restricts federally funded abortion cases only to those of rape, incest and life of the mother. Over time, this has grown to include government health programs like Medicaid and Obamacare. At the rally, Clinton said she believes Planned Parenthood, America’s largest abortion provider, should be “fully funded” citing that the measure discriminates against low-income women. The group took in over $500 million from taxpayers in 2014 for non-abortion activities.\n\nSanders strengthens in Iowa, N.H. - WSJ: “ Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are deadlocked in both Iowa and New Hampshire three weeks before voting begins in the 2016 presidential race, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds. The Republican primary contest also remains tight in Iowa. Mrs. Clinton holds a slim, 48%-to-45% lead over the Vermont senator among likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, the survey found. Mr. Sanders edges the former secretary of state among likely primary voters in New Hampshire, 50% to 46%. Both leads are within the polling margins of error.”\n\nKOCH GROUP UNVEILS OBAMACARE RATE TRACKER\nFreedom Partners is releasing a 2016 Obamacare Premium Increase Tracker today, ahead of President Obama’s State of the Union speech. The tracker shows the average health care premium increases in each state on the individual marketplace for 2016. Freedom Partners’ policy team calculates that premiums on the individual marketplace increased in 49 out of 50 states. In most states, costs went up by double-digits. Seventeen states will see premium increases of 20 percent of more, the group says.\n\n[Brackets Obama - Rather than giving her old boss a clear media lane for his last big speech as president, Hillary Clinton is doing a sit-down interview with CNN that’s set to air Tuesday, just ahead of President Obama’s final State of the Union Address.]\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE…\nSaying you liked the music of David Bowie would be like saying you liked Chinese food.

Is he probably just Huntsmaning? Yes. Would that be consequential? Yes.\n\nState and national polling shows that the third coming of Chris Christie is not upon us. After weeks of media speculation that the long-dormant chances of the New Jersey governor were going erupt in a riot of electoral possibilities, there’s no evidence of it.\n\nSame goes for Jeb Bush, whose remaining loyalists say is now eying South Carolina as his real last stand. Bless his heart.\n\nThe name of the game for Kasich, Christie and Bush is to beat Marco Rubio. Anywhere. Anyhow. He runs best against Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups and, booties or not, seems to be starting to solidify his place.\n\nNew Hampshire, with a primary open to Democrats and independents, and an electorate more liberal and secular than the rest of the early voting-states presents the best chance to knock down Rubio.\n\nAside from an iron-clad consistency that Christie seems to lack and an energy that Bush cannot bring, Kasich is also the kind of Republican that attracts Democrats. Like Trump, he has true crossover appeal.\n\nWhile Rubio has been sparring with Christie and Bush, he may fight his last round in New Hampshire with Kasich.\n\n1) Ted Cruz; 2) Marco Rubio; 3) Donald Trump; 4) Jeb Bush [+1]; 5) Chris Christie [-1]; 6) John Kasich [previously unranked]\n\nOn the radar - Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Rand Paul\n\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins “The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\n\nWhat would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN’s Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump. … Cruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on ‘State of the Union’ that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S. ‘No, I don’t intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That’s not how we enforce the law for any crime,’ Cruz [said.]”\n\nTrump’s new birther gusto - WaPo: “After days of coyly raising questions about Ted Cruz’s eligibility to be president, given that he was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father, Donald Trump let his audience weigh in at a rally Sunday afternoon. ‘Is he a natural-born citizen?’ the Republican White House hopeful asked several thousand gathered in a Reno ballroom. Members of the crowd shouted back, ‘No!’ ‘I don’t know,’ Trump said. ‘Honestly, we don’t know. Who the hell knows.’ Cruz was Trump’s No. 1 target during the 65-minute event, revealing just how much of a threat the Republican senator from Texas has become to the front-runner. Before the rally started, Bruce Springsteen's ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ blared, a new edition to Trump’s playlist.”\n\nTrump signs Huntsman group’s pledge - AP: “No Labels, formed after the 2010 midterm elections, is asking candidates to embrace four broad goals related to job creation, the federal budget, energy independence and entitlements, promote them in the campaign and promise to work with a bipartisan group in Congress on at least one of them within 30 days of taking office…On Monday, the group’s leaders are announcing the six who stepped up: Democrat Martin O'Malley, and Republicans Ben Carson, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rand Paul and Donald Trump.”\n\nABC drops debate partner at Trump’s behest - WFXT: “Donald Trump announced Sunday that he had the New Hampshire Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate on Feb. 6. Politico reports that ABC cut their partnership with the paper, the largest newspaper in New Hampshire, a source citing a strained relationship, caused by the front page editorials about Donald Trump. Trump is taking credit for the end of the relationship, saying the paper’s behavior has been ‘highly unethical’ and it has endorsed a candidate who can’t win. On Nov. 28, the paper endorsed Gov. Chris Christie.”\n\nRubio makes major ad push in Iowa - DMR: “Marco Rubio is poised to dominate Iowa’s television airwaves with about 7,000 ads scheduled to run from Jan. 1 until caucus day — an effort that accounts for more than one-third of all political ads slated to air during that time. The purchases on Rubio's behalf make up more than half of the $9.4 million in total spending for ads that are scheduled to air across the state during the final month of the caucus campaign.”\n\nDespite past quotes, Christie denies Planned Parenthood donations - WSJ: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied Sunday that he has given money to Planned Parenthood, hitting back at a claim by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. ‘I never donated to Planned Parenthood,’ Mr. Christie told CBS on Face the Nation…On Fox Business last week, Mr. Rubio highlighted positions that he said aligned Mr. Christie with President Barack Obama [including Planned Parenthood donations]…A 2012 book on the governor – ‘Chris Christie: The Inside Story of His Rise to Power’ — recalls an incident in the mid-90s where Mr. Christie opposed county funding for Planned Parenthood on financial grounds, even though he said he supported it ideologically. ‘I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution,’ he said, according to the book. When asked about the apparent conflict with the statement from decades ago, a Christie spokeswoman said: ‘The governor didn’t donate to Planned Parenthood.’”\n\nPOWER PLAY: IOWA INTRICACIES\nAs Donald Trump continues to dig into Ted Cruz, the competition for Iowa is kicking into high gear.

A similar ad with a different ending will be shown in New Hampshire.\n\nOpening on the White House, the ad shows a sweltering industrial plant, a fighter taking off from an aircraft carrier and a family of four sitting down to dinner. “The person who lives here,” a male narrator intones, “has to solve problems as big as the world and as small as your kitchen table.”\n\nViewers are taken on a quick tour of Mrs. Clinton’s extended career in public service: surrounded by children as first lady, when she “helped get health care for eight million kids”; as a senator from New York, standing grim-faced in a trench coat amid the debris at ground zero, where, the ad says, she “helped a city rise again”; and speaking soberly to an attentive President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as the voice-over says she has “stared down hostile leaders around the world.” She is seen on the campaign trail and in the Situation Room with President Obama as the ad calls her the “one candidate for president who has everything it takes to do every part of the job.”\n\nThe ad rattles off Mrs. Clinton’s touchstone promises: to defend Social Security and Medicare against privatization, protect Planned Parenthood from shutdown, “take on the gun lobby” and “finally get equal pay for women.” Clips of a shouting Donald J. Trump and of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas aiming an assault weapon at a gun range symbolize the threat as the narrator says Mrs. Clinton will “stop the Republicans from ripping all our progress away.”\n\nIt closes with Mrs. Clinton, back in October, assuring Iowa Democrats, “I’m listening to you, I’m fighting for you, and with your support, I’m going to deliver,” as viewers are urged to “caucus for Hillary.”\n\nAn entire candidacy boiled down to a minute. With its heavy focus on foreign policy and experience in a crisis, the ad plays up ways in which Mrs. Clinton’s résumé compares favorably with that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her unnamed Democratic rival. The references to gun control offer a reminder of her recent attacks on Mr. Sanders’s record on that issue. And she returns to women’s rights, on which she began her campaign. To “keep America safe and build a stronger economy,” the ad sums up, “Hillary’s the choice.”\n\nIn 2008, Mrs. Clinton was criticized for what some saw as an overstatement of her role in enacting the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. But this ad gets it right: She was a driving force on the bill within her husband’s administration, aiding the efforts of Edward M. Kennedy and others who led the fight for it in the Senate.\n\nIowa broadcast markets.\n\nIt feels as if it’s much longer than 60 seconds, and that is a good thing: The ad seeks to give Mrs. Clinton’s strengths the feeling of overwhelming force while conveying that only she has what it takes to meet the demands of the presidency and to defend what Democrats hold dear.","gunning_fog_5":"9.2","flesch_5":"7.9","readability_5":"70.13","gold_title":"The Seattle Times editorial board recommends John Kasich, Bernie Sanders","gold_url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-seattle-times-editorial-board-recommends-john-kasich-bernie-sanders/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Seattle Times","gold_body":"Authenticity and consistency are so rare in politics these days — no wonder a strong number of voters are supporting U.S. Sen.

He took dozens of shouted questions each day at events not billed as town halls, and reveled in the adoration given to a candidate who badly wants to earn top billing here on February 1. \nHis red meat connected. His crowds swelled. His applause never ended.\nRead: Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented\nHe also has, by most accounts, a first-class ground game and as of this Wednesday, a high-powered super PAC operation to fund his message on the airwaves here.\nBut beneath the surface, Cruz's hold on Iowa is tenuous, a close observation of 15 of his events reveals. He's on the defensive over his ethanol position, has had his religion and citizenship questioned. And there's still plenty of time for the dynamics of the race to shift against him.\nHere's what we learned from Cruz's bus tour -- and what can still hold him back in the final three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nCruz spent much of the week fielding persistent questions not about his momentum in Iowa, but about his mother's voting history in Canada and whether he was being 100% truthful about his knowledge of what happened north of the border. It was, in the eyes of any political observer, off message.\nRead: Why Donald Trump may be hoping for a long caucus night in Iowa\nThe son of a Cuban man and an American woman, most legal experts agree Cruz is a naturally-born U.S. citizen eligible to be commander-in-chief. \nCruz told CNN's Dana Bash that he's not concerned about the issue. \"Of course not,\" Cruz said. \"Yes, I'm sure. The media, with all due respect, love to engage in silly sideshows. We need to focus on what matters.\"\n\"The legal issue is straightforward,\" he added, calling it a \"non-issue.\" \"Listen, the Constitution and the laws of the United States are straightforward. The very first Congress defined the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad as a natural-born citizen.\"\nRead: Cruz dismisses 'swamp theories' on citizenship\nTrump does not appear to see it that way. Although the billionaire has not outright said Cruz is ineligible to be president, he intensified his criticism at two Iowa campaign rallies on Saturday.\n\"He was born in Canada. I guess his parents voted in Canada,\" Trump said in Clear Lake. \"So if you were born in Canada, immediately it's a little bit of a problem.\"\nAfter six months of never veering off the message of unbridled respect for the national GOP front-runner, Cruz this week said that he wouldn't be accepting unsolicited legal advice from him and suggested that Trump is \"panicking\" because of Cruz's recent surge in Iowa polls.\nRead: Rubio hits Cruz on immigration, Snowden\n\"A few weeks ago, everyone in the field was attacking Donald Trump,\" Cruz said time and time again across northern Iowa, barely containing his smile. \"Now, everyone's attacking me. That suggests something's changed.\" \nBut the most substantive political point came late Friday evening in a basement at Mabe's Pizza in Winneshiek County. It was his sixth stop of the day -- Cruz had more energy than the press corps and senior staff traveling with him -- when a man asked him to directly pitch why he should vote for Cruz over his rival.\n\"Listen, there is an 'Iowa way' of campaigning and deciding caucuses. I believe the only way to compete and win in the state of Iowa is to come and spend the time asking the voters for their support, looking them in the eye, having the humility to submit yourself to the men and women of this state,\" his voice racing forward and raising in volume. \"And if a candidate is not doing that, that ought to be an indication.\" \n\nAt event after event in northern Iowa, Cruz was repeatedly confronted by audience members who lodged emotional, and sometimes agitated, complaints about his record on ethanol and desire to eliminate the Renewable Fuel Standard.\nThere was the man in the Casey's General Store in Manly who button-holed Cruz and wouldn't let him go until an aide physically moved the senator onto a different voter. There were the farmers who asked, with a pang of concern, whether there was just something about Cruz's position that they must've misheard.\n\"I'm a corn farmer. I've been following your campaign and I see that you've modified your stance on the RFS,\" Bob Hemesath, a local corn industry leader, asked Cruz in Decorah. \"And in reality, you haven't really modified your stance.\"\nCruz nodded. On that, they agreed.\nRead: For Ted Cruz, the last voter in the room is the hardest\nCruz has tried to pitch Iowans on other parts of his ethanol policy beyond the RFS, most prominently rolling back an EPA regulation that limits the amount of gasoline that can be in an ethanol blend. But these Iowans that Cruz has tried to win over were rarely convinced by those arguments, which they see as B-list concerns to the RFS that Cruz wants to phase out within five years.\nAt nearly every stop, Cruz would motion behind him and point at the best validator he could, Dave VanderGreind, an Iowan ethanol magnate who agreed with Cruz's point that the RFS was not the be-all-end-all.  \nThe campaign wants to keep repeating its message, and when the team was surprised to see no one ask about his position on the RFS in Webster City on Thursday, Rep. Steve King whispered in Cruz's ear.\n\"Alright, so Steve raised one additional question. He said there may be someone here wondering about ethanol,\" Cruz said. \"So let's talk about that for a second.\"\n\nThe scourge of Washington Republicans -- he has few friends in the Senate -- and of critics who label him robotic, harsh and grating, Cruz is offering Iowans a look at a kinder, gentler side in the final weeks before voters here decide his fate. It is his campaign's soft sell, its final attempt to show Republicans that he isn't just right on the issues, but decent enough and homely enough to win their vote.\n\"It's not just smart politics. It's smart relationships,\" said Bob Vander Plaats, who is standing a step behind Cruz at every stop on his bus tour as one of Cruz's top allies in the state. \"You're seeing him being more vulnerable.\" \nWhen a woman in a hotel lobby told Cruz about the death of her son, a veteran who suffered from post-traumatic disorder, the Texas firebrand lowered his voice to something close to a microphoned whisper: \"My mom lost my older brother as an infant,\" he shared.\nAt Dr. Thomas Gleason's Airplane Hangar in Webster City, he told Edith Verman-Frank, a 76-year-old survivor of two simultaneous stage four cancers, that his mother too was a 15-year breast cancer survivor. Two questions later, Cruz was explaining to Jaci Bagwell that he understand her worries about student loans debt -- he only paid off his $100,000 in debt five years ago.\nBut Cruz has worked hard over the past seven months to maintain his standing as the most conservative candidate in the field, and his outpourings of empathy have political limits.\nWhen asked in the hotel lobby in Storm Lake by a young, undocumented woman who said she was troubled by Cruz's new plan that he would deport people like her immediately if elected, Cruz showed no pity. \n\"Well, listen, I would note if you're a DACA recipient, it means that you were brought here illegally,\" Cruz told her as the room grew silent. \"And violating the laws have consequences.\"","gunning_fog_1":"10.0","flesch_1":"8.7","readability_1":"68.1","index_2":"0","title_2":"Bernie Sanders Lunchtime Scoop: ‘Tuna Salad’","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/bernie-sanders-lunchtime-scoop-tuna-salad/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"ST.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said that 22 documents containing “top secret” information will be excluded entirely from the release of Mrs. Clinton’s email archive. So far, more than 1,300 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails have been redacted, with portions blocked out, due to the presence of classified information, but this is the first example of emails being entirely withheld from public release.\nMr. Kirby also said the State Department would conduct an investigation to determine whether the emails were classified at the time they were sent or received on Mrs. Clinton’s personal email server. That marks a shift from the longtime State Department position that any classification was done after the fact. Mr. Kirby added that whether they were classified at the time or not, they didn’t contain markings identifying them as classified. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, wrote on Twitter:  “This is overclassification run amok. We adamantly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails.” Byron Tau reports.\nTHE A-HED: FIGHTING FOR IOWA VOTERS, BERNIE SANDERS LEADS IN YAROSLAVL\nA trip to the Soviet Union in 1988 gave rise in Yaroslavl to a small but ardent Russian outpost of enthusiastic Bernie Sanders fans. Paul Sonne reports.\nWSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS\nINCOME FOR RECENT GRADUATES THE HIGHEST IN OVER A DECADE: The labor market has taken a sharp turn for the better for young college graduates. Incomes for the newest batch of diploma-holders have reached the highest level in more than a decade and their unemployment rates are falling quickly, according to a new economic report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Their experience now underscores a growing divide in the U.S. economybetween those with a college degree and those without. The median holder of a bachelor’s degree, ages 22 to 27, earned $43,000 last year, an increase of over $3,000 from the year before. That is the highest since 2003, showing that the job market for freshly minted graduates has nearly recovered to the best years on record.  Josh Zumbrun reports.\nCENTRAL BANKS TRY UNCONVENTIONAL POLICY TOOLS: Central banks around the world are going to new lengths to boost their economies, underscoring both the importance and limitations of monetary policy in a global economy plagued by paltry growth and unsettled markets. In the latest shift, the Bank of Japan Friday joined a number of European peers in setting its key short-term interest rate below zero for the first time. The move, long denied as a possible course by the banks own governor, came a week after the European Central Bank president said he was ready to launch additional monetary stimulus in March, and just days after the U.S. Federal Reserve expressed renewed worry about market turbulence and sluggish growth overseas.

The economy had advanced 2% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter. Despite weak first and fourth quarters to bookend the year, growth for 2015 as a whole was steady.

That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.666666666666667,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T02:39:43+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952915765,"created_at":"2016-04-08T02:00:11+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T01:49:24+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CO","city":"Denver","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915110,"worker_id":25111984,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.898324978381833,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"-1","q2":"1","q3":"1","q4":"2","q5":"-1","q6":"0","q7":"-1","q8":"1","q9":"0","q10":"2","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"5064","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"4","index_1":"45","title_1":"Takeaways from Ted Cruz's Iowa road trip","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/cruz-iowa-takeaways/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Strawberry Point, Iowa (CNN) He is the front-runner, and he knows it.\nOn the surface, Ted Cruz looked as strong as ever during his six-day, 28-county bus tour across the Hawkeye State last week week, filling Christian bookstores and old schoolhouses as he trekked from the Missouri to the Mississippi rivers at a workmanlike pace. He took dozens of shouted questions each day at events not billed as town halls, and reveled in the adoration given to a candidate who badly wants to earn top billing here on February 1. \nHis red meat connected. His crowds swelled. His applause never ended.\nRead: Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented\nHe also has, by most accounts, a first-class ground game and as of this Wednesday, a high-powered super PAC operation to fund his message on the airwaves here.\nBut beneath the surface, Cruz's hold on Iowa is tenuous, a close observation of 15 of his events reveals. He's on the defensive over his ethanol position, has had his religion and citizenship questioned. And there's still plenty of time for the dynamics of the race to shift against him.\nHere's what we learned from Cruz's bus tour -- and what can still hold him back in the final three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nCruz spent much of the week fielding persistent questions not about his momentum in Iowa, but about his mother's voting history in Canada and whether he was being 100% truthful about his knowledge of what happened north of the border. It was, in the eyes of any political observer, off message.\nRead: Why Donald Trump may be hoping for a long caucus night in Iowa\nThe son of a Cuban man and an American woman, most legal experts agree Cruz is a naturally-born U.S. citizen eligible to be commander-in-chief. \nCruz told CNN's Dana Bash that he's not concerned about the issue. \"Of course not,\" Cruz said. \"Yes, I'm sure. The media, with all due respect, love to engage in silly sideshows. We need to focus on what matters.\"\n\"The legal issue is straightforward,\" he added, calling it a \"non-issue.\" \"Listen, the Constitution and the laws of the United States are straightforward. The very first Congress defined the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad as a natural-born citizen.\"\nRead: Cruz dismisses 'swamp theories' on citizenship\nTrump does not appear to see it that way. Although the billionaire has not outright said Cruz is ineligible to be president, he intensified his criticism at two Iowa campaign rallies on Saturday.\n\"He was born in Canada. I guess his parents voted in Canada,\" Trump said in Clear Lake. \"So if you were born in Canada, immediately it's a little bit of a problem.\"\nAfter six months of never veering off the message of unbridled respect for the national GOP front-runner, Cruz this week said that he wouldn't be accepting unsolicited legal advice from him and suggested that Trump is \"panicking\" because of Cruz's recent surge in Iowa polls.\nRead: Rubio hits Cruz on immigration, Snowden\n\"A few weeks ago, everyone in the field was attacking Donald Trump,\" Cruz said time and time again across northern Iowa, barely containing his smile. \"Now, everyone's attacking me. That suggests something's changed.\" \nBut the most substantive political point came late Friday evening in a basement at Mabe's Pizza in Winneshiek County. It was his sixth stop of the day -- Cruz had more energy than the press corps and senior staff traveling with him -- when a man asked him to directly pitch why he should vote for Cruz over his rival.\n\"Listen, there is an 'Iowa way' of campaigning and deciding caucuses. I believe the only way to compete and win in the state of Iowa is to come and spend the time asking the voters for their support, looking them in the eye, having the humility to submit yourself to the men and women of this state,\" his voice racing forward and raising in volume. \"And if a candidate is not doing that, that ought to be an indication.\" \n\nAt event after event in northern Iowa, Cruz was repeatedly confronted by audience members who lodged emotional, and sometimes agitated, complaints about his record on ethanol and desire to eliminate the Renewable Fuel Standard.\nThere was the man in the Casey's General Store in Manly who button-holed Cruz and wouldn't let him go until an aide physically moved the senator onto a different voter. There were the farmers who asked, with a pang of concern, whether there was just something about Cruz's position that they must've misheard.\n\"I'm a corn farmer. I've been following your campaign and I see that you've modified your stance on the RFS,\" Bob Hemesath, a local corn industry leader, asked Cruz in Decorah. \"And in reality, you haven't really modified your stance.\"\nCruz nodded. On that, they agreed.\nRead: For Ted Cruz, the last voter in the room is the hardest\nCruz has tried to pitch Iowans on other parts of his ethanol policy beyond the RFS, most prominently rolling back an EPA regulation that limits the amount of gasoline that can be in an ethanol blend. But these Iowans that Cruz has tried to win over were rarely convinced by those arguments, which they see as B-list concerns to the RFS that Cruz wants to phase out within five years.\nAt nearly every stop, Cruz would motion behind him and point at the best validator he could, Dave VanderGreind, an Iowan ethanol magnate who agreed with Cruz's point that the RFS was not the be-all-end-all.  \nThe campaign wants to keep repeating its message, and when the team was surprised to see no one ask about his position on the RFS in Webster City on Thursday, Rep. Steve King whispered in Cruz's ear.\n\"Alright, so Steve raised one additional question. He said there may be someone here wondering about ethanol,\" Cruz said. \"So let's talk about that for a second.\"\n\nThe scourge of Washington Republicans -- he has few friends in the Senate -- and of critics who label him robotic, harsh and grating, Cruz is offering Iowans a look at a kinder, gentler side in the final weeks before voters here decide his fate. It is his campaign's soft sell, its final attempt to show Republicans that he isn't just right on the issues, but decent enough and homely enough to win their vote.\n\"It's not just smart politics. It's smart relationships,\" said Bob Vander Plaats, who is standing a step behind Cruz at every stop on his bus tour as one of Cruz's top allies in the state. \"You're seeing him being more vulnerable.\" \nWhen a woman in a hotel lobby told Cruz about the death of her son, a veteran who suffered from post-traumatic disorder, the Texas firebrand lowered his voice to something close to a microphoned whisper: \"My mom lost my older brother as an infant,\" he shared.\nAt Dr. Thomas Gleason's Airplane Hangar in Webster City, he told Edith Verman-Frank, a 76-year-old survivor of two simultaneous stage four cancers, that his mother too was a 15-year breast cancer survivor. Two questions later, Cruz was explaining to Jaci Bagwell that he understand her worries about student loans debt -- he only paid off his $100,000 in debt five years ago.\nBut Cruz has worked hard over the past seven months to maintain his standing as the most conservative candidate in the field, and his outpourings of empathy have political limits.\nWhen asked in the hotel lobby in Storm Lake by a young, undocumented woman who said she was troubled by Cruz's new plan that he would deport people like her immediately if elected, Cruz showed no pity. \n\"Well, listen, I would note if you're a DACA recipient, it means that you were brought here illegally,\" Cruz told her as the room grew silent. \"And violating the laws have consequences.\"","gunning_fog_1":"10.0","flesch_1":"8.7","readability_1":"68.1","index_2":"0","title_2":"Bernie Sanders Lunchtime Scoop: ‘Tuna Salad’","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/bernie-sanders-lunchtime-scoop-tuna-salad/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"ST.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said that 22 documents containing “top secret” information will be excluded entirely from the release of Mrs. Clinton’s email archive. So far, more than 1,300 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails have been redacted, with portions blocked out, due to the presence of classified information, but this is the first example of emails being entirely withheld from public release.\nMr. Kirby also said the State Department would conduct an investigation to determine whether the emails were classified at the time they were sent or received on Mrs. Clinton’s personal email server. That marks a shift from the longtime State Department position that any classification was done after the fact. Mr. Kirby added that whether they were classified at the time or not, they didn’t contain markings identifying them as classified. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, wrote on Twitter:  “This is overclassification run amok. We adamantly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails.” Byron Tau reports.\nTHE A-HED: FIGHTING FOR IOWA VOTERS, BERNIE SANDERS LEADS IN YAROSLAVL\nA trip to the Soviet Union in 1988 gave rise in Yaroslavl to a small but ardent Russian outpost of enthusiastic Bernie Sanders fans. Paul Sonne reports.\nWSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS\nINCOME FOR RECENT GRADUATES THE HIGHEST IN OVER A DECADE: The labor market has taken a sharp turn for the better for young college graduates. Incomes for the newest batch of diploma-holders have reached the highest level in more than a decade and their unemployment rates are falling quickly, according to a new economic report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Their experience now underscores a growing divide in the U.S. economybetween those with a college degree and those without. The median holder of a bachelor’s degree, ages 22 to 27, earned $43,000 last year, an increase of over $3,000 from the year before. That is the highest since 2003, showing that the job market for freshly minted graduates has nearly recovered to the best years on record.  Josh Zumbrun reports.\nCENTRAL BANKS TRY UNCONVENTIONAL POLICY TOOLS: Central banks around the world are going to new lengths to boost their economies, underscoring both the importance and limitations of monetary policy in a global economy plagued by paltry growth and unsettled markets. In the latest shift, the Bank of Japan Friday joined a number of European peers in setting its key short-term interest rate below zero for the first time. The move, long denied as a possible course by the banks own governor, came a week after the European Central Bank president said he was ready to launch additional monetary stimulus in March, and just days after the U.S. Federal Reserve expressed renewed worry about market turbulence and sluggish growth overseas.

The economy had advanced 2% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter. Despite weak first and fourth quarters to bookend the year, growth for 2015 as a whole was steady.

That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}},{"id":1952916270,"created_at":"2016-04-08T02:01:21+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T01:50:29+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NY","city":"New York","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915110,"worker_id":36517633,"trust":0.8125,"worker_trust":0.877375,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"2","q1":"1","q2":"1","q3":"1","q4":"2","q5":"-1","q6":"2","q7":"-1","q8":"2","q9":"-1","q10":"2","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"4","index_1":"45","title_1":"Takeaways from Ted Cruz's Iowa road trip","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/cruz-iowa-takeaways/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Strawberry Point, Iowa (CNN) He is the front-runner, and he knows it.\nOn the surface, Ted Cruz looked as strong as ever during his six-day, 28-county bus tour across the Hawkeye State last week week, filling Christian bookstores and old schoolhouses as he trekked from the Missouri to the Mississippi rivers at a workmanlike pace. He took dozens of shouted questions each day at events not billed as town halls, and reveled in the adoration given to a candidate who badly wants to earn top billing here on February 1. \nHis red meat connected. His crowds swelled. His applause never ended.\nRead: Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented\nHe also has, by most accounts, a first-class ground game and as of this Wednesday, a high-powered super PAC operation to fund his message on the airwaves here.\nBut beneath the surface, Cruz's hold on Iowa is tenuous, a close observation of 15 of his events reveals. He's on the defensive over his ethanol position, has had his religion and citizenship questioned. And there's still plenty of time for the dynamics of the race to shift against him.\nHere's what we learned from Cruz's bus tour -- and what can still hold him back in the final three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nCruz spent much of the week fielding persistent questions not about his momentum in Iowa, but about his mother's voting history in Canada and whether he was being 100% truthful about his knowledge of what happened north of the border. It was, in the eyes of any political observer, off message.\nRead: Why Donald Trump may be hoping for a long caucus night in Iowa\nThe son of a Cuban man and an American woman, most legal experts agree Cruz is a naturally-born U.S. citizen eligible to be commander-in-chief. \nCruz told CNN's Dana Bash that he's not concerned about the issue. \"Of course not,\" Cruz said. \"Yes, I'm sure. The media, with all due respect, love to engage in silly sideshows. We need to focus on what matters.\"\n\"The legal issue is straightforward,\" he added, calling it a \"non-issue.\" \"Listen, the Constitution and the laws of the United States are straightforward. The very first Congress defined the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad as a natural-born citizen.\"\nRead: Cruz dismisses 'swamp theories' on citizenship\nTrump does not appear to see it that way. Although the billionaire has not outright said Cruz is ineligible to be president, he intensified his criticism at two Iowa campaign rallies on Saturday.\n\"He was born in Canada. I guess his parents voted in Canada,\" Trump said in Clear Lake. \"So if you were born in Canada, immediately it's a little bit of a problem.\"\nAfter six months of never veering off the message of unbridled respect for the national GOP front-runner, Cruz this week said that he wouldn't be accepting unsolicited legal advice from him and suggested that Trump is \"panicking\" because of Cruz's recent surge in Iowa polls.\nRead: Rubio hits Cruz on immigration, Snowden\n\"A few weeks ago, everyone in the field was attacking Donald Trump,\" Cruz said time and time again across northern Iowa, barely containing his smile. \"Now, everyone's attacking me. That suggests something's changed.\" \nBut the most substantive political point came late Friday evening in a basement at Mabe's Pizza in Winneshiek County. It was his sixth stop of the day -- Cruz had more energy than the press corps and senior staff traveling with him -- when a man asked him to directly pitch why he should vote for Cruz over his rival.\n\"Listen, there is an 'Iowa way' of campaigning and deciding caucuses. I believe the only way to compete and win in the state of Iowa is to come and spend the time asking the voters for their support, looking them in the eye, having the humility to submit yourself to the men and women of this state,\" his voice racing forward and raising in volume. \"And if a candidate is not doing that, that ought to be an indication.\" \n\nAt event after event in northern Iowa, Cruz was repeatedly confronted by audience members who lodged emotional, and sometimes agitated, complaints about his record on ethanol and desire to eliminate the Renewable Fuel Standard.\nThere was the man in the Casey's General Store in Manly who button-holed Cruz and wouldn't let him go until an aide physically moved the senator onto a different voter. There were the farmers who asked, with a pang of concern, whether there was just something about Cruz's position that they must've misheard.\n\"I'm a corn farmer. I've been following your campaign and I see that you've modified your stance on the RFS,\" Bob Hemesath, a local corn industry leader, asked Cruz in Decorah. \"And in reality, you haven't really modified your stance.\"\nCruz nodded. On that, they agreed.\nRead: For Ted Cruz, the last voter in the room is the hardest\nCruz has tried to pitch Iowans on other parts of his ethanol policy beyond the RFS, most prominently rolling back an EPA regulation that limits the amount of gasoline that can be in an ethanol blend. But these Iowans that Cruz has tried to win over were rarely convinced by those arguments, which they see as B-list concerns to the RFS that Cruz wants to phase out within five years.\nAt nearly every stop, Cruz would motion behind him and point at the best validator he could, Dave VanderGreind, an Iowan ethanol magnate who agreed with Cruz's point that the RFS was not the be-all-end-all.  \nThe campaign wants to keep repeating its message, and when the team was surprised to see no one ask about his position on the RFS in Webster City on Thursday, Rep. Steve King whispered in Cruz's ear.\n\"Alright, so Steve raised one additional question. He said there may be someone here wondering about ethanol,\" Cruz said. \"So let's talk about that for a second.\"\n\nThe scourge of Washington Republicans -- he has few friends in the Senate -- and of critics who label him robotic, harsh and grating, Cruz is offering Iowans a look at a kinder, gentler side in the final weeks before voters here decide his fate. It is his campaign's soft sell, its final attempt to show Republicans that he isn't just right on the issues, but decent enough and homely enough to win their vote.\n\"It's not just smart politics. It's smart relationships,\" said Bob Vander Plaats, who is standing a step behind Cruz at every stop on his bus tour as one of Cruz's top allies in the state. \"You're seeing him being more vulnerable.\" \nWhen a woman in a hotel lobby told Cruz about the death of her son, a veteran who suffered from post-traumatic disorder, the Texas firebrand lowered his voice to something close to a microphoned whisper: \"My mom lost my older brother as an infant,\" he shared.\nAt Dr. Thomas Gleason's Airplane Hangar in Webster City, he told Edith Verman-Frank, a 76-year-old survivor of two simultaneous stage four cancers, that his mother too was a 15-year breast cancer survivor. Two questions later, Cruz was explaining to Jaci Bagwell that he understand her worries about student loans debt -- he only paid off his $100,000 in debt five years ago.\nBut Cruz has worked hard over the past seven months to maintain his standing as the most conservative candidate in the field, and his outpourings of empathy have political limits.\nWhen asked in the hotel lobby in Storm Lake by a young, undocumented woman who said she was troubled by Cruz's new plan that he would deport people like her immediately if elected, Cruz showed no pity. \n\"Well, listen, I would note if you're a DACA recipient, it means that you were brought here illegally,\" Cruz told her as the room grew silent. \"And violating the laws have consequences.\"","gunning_fog_1":"10.0","flesch_1":"8.7","readability_1":"68.1","index_2":"0","title_2":"Bernie Sanders Lunchtime Scoop: ‘Tuna Salad’","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/bernie-sanders-lunchtime-scoop-tuna-salad/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"ST.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said that 22 documents containing “top secret” information will be excluded entirely from the release of Mrs. Clinton’s email archive. So far, more than 1,300 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails have been redacted, with portions blocked out, due to the presence of classified information, but this is the first example of emails being entirely withheld from public release.\nMr. Kirby also said the State Department would conduct an investigation to determine whether the emails were classified at the time they were sent or received on Mrs. Clinton’s personal email server. That marks a shift from the longtime State Department position that any classification was done after the fact. Mr. Kirby added that whether they were classified at the time or not, they didn’t contain markings identifying them as classified. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, wrote on Twitter:  “This is overclassification run amok. We adamantly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails.” Byron Tau reports.\nTHE A-HED: FIGHTING FOR IOWA VOTERS, BERNIE SANDERS LEADS IN YAROSLAVL\nA trip to the Soviet Union in 1988 gave rise in Yaroslavl to a small but ardent Russian outpost of enthusiastic Bernie Sanders fans. Paul Sonne reports.\nWSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS\nINCOME FOR RECENT GRADUATES THE HIGHEST IN OVER A DECADE: The labor market has taken a sharp turn for the better for young college graduates. Incomes for the newest batch of diploma-holders have reached the highest level in more than a decade and their unemployment rates are falling quickly, according to a new economic report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Their experience now underscores a growing divide in the U.S. economybetween those with a college degree and those without. The median holder of a bachelor’s degree, ages 22 to 27, earned $43,000 last year, an increase of over $3,000 from the year before. That is the highest since 2003, showing that the job market for freshly minted graduates has nearly recovered to the best years on record.  Josh Zumbrun reports.\nCENTRAL BANKS TRY UNCONVENTIONAL POLICY TOOLS: Central banks around the world are going to new lengths to boost their economies, underscoring both the importance and limitations of monetary policy in a global economy plagued by paltry growth and unsettled markets. In the latest shift, the Bank of Japan Friday joined a number of European peers in setting its key short-term interest rate below zero for the first time. The move, long denied as a possible course by the banks own governor, came a week after the European Central Bank president said he was ready to launch additional monetary stimulus in March, and just days after the U.S. Federal Reserve expressed renewed worry about market turbulence and sluggish growth overseas.

The economy had advanced 2% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter. Despite weak first and fourth quarters to bookend the year, growth for 2015 as a whole was steady.

That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}},{"id":1952935182,"created_at":"2016-04-08T02:39:31+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T02:31:57+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NE","city":"Papillion","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915110,"worker_id":16468100,"trust":0.520833333333333,"worker_trust":0.830360562143171,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"0","q6":"1","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"0","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"ted_cruz"},"unit_data":{"nil":"4","index_1":"45","title_1":"Takeaways from Ted Cruz's Iowa road trip","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/cruz-iowa-takeaways/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Strawberry Point, Iowa (CNN) He is the front-runner, and he knows it.\nOn the surface, Ted Cruz looked as strong as ever during his six-day, 28-county bus tour across the Hawkeye State last week week, filling Christian bookstores and old schoolhouses as he trekked from the Missouri to the Mississippi rivers at a workmanlike pace. He took dozens of shouted questions each day at events not billed as town halls, and reveled in the adoration given to a candidate who badly wants to earn top billing here on February 1. \nHis red meat connected. His crowds swelled. His applause never ended.\nRead: Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented\nHe also has, by most accounts, a first-class ground game and as of this Wednesday, a high-powered super PAC operation to fund his message on the airwaves here.\nBut beneath the surface, Cruz's hold on Iowa is tenuous, a close observation of 15 of his events reveals. He's on the defensive over his ethanol position, has had his religion and citizenship questioned. And there's still plenty of time for the dynamics of the race to shift against him.\nHere's what we learned from Cruz's bus tour -- and what can still hold him back in the final three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nCruz spent much of the week fielding persistent questions not about his momentum in Iowa, but about his mother's voting history in Canada and whether he was being 100% truthful about his knowledge of what happened north of the border. It was, in the eyes of any political observer, off message.\nRead: Why Donald Trump may be hoping for a long caucus night in Iowa\nThe son of a Cuban man and an American woman, most legal experts agree Cruz is a naturally-born U.S. citizen eligible to be commander-in-chief. \nCruz told CNN's Dana Bash that he's not concerned about the issue. \"Of course not,\" Cruz said. \"Yes, I'm sure. The media, with all due respect, love to engage in silly sideshows. We need to focus on what matters.\"\n\"The legal issue is straightforward,\" he added, calling it a \"non-issue.\" \"Listen, the Constitution and the laws of the United States are straightforward. The very first Congress defined the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad as a natural-born citizen.\"\nRead: Cruz dismisses 'swamp theories' on citizenship\nTrump does not appear to see it that way. Although the billionaire has not outright said Cruz is ineligible to be president, he intensified his criticism at two Iowa campaign rallies on Saturday.\n\"He was born in Canada. I guess his parents voted in Canada,\" Trump said in Clear Lake. \"So if you were born in Canada, immediately it's a little bit of a problem.\"\nAfter six months of never veering off the message of unbridled respect for the national GOP front-runner, Cruz this week said that he wouldn't be accepting unsolicited legal advice from him and suggested that Trump is \"panicking\" because of Cruz's recent surge in Iowa polls.\nRead: Rubio hits Cruz on immigration, Snowden\n\"A few weeks ago, everyone in the field was attacking Donald Trump,\" Cruz said time and time again across northern Iowa, barely containing his smile. \"Now, everyone's attacking me. That suggests something's changed.\" \nBut the most substantive political point came late Friday evening in a basement at Mabe's Pizza in Winneshiek County. It was his sixth stop of the day -- Cruz had more energy than the press corps and senior staff traveling with him -- when a man asked him to directly pitch why he should vote for Cruz over his rival.\n\"Listen, there is an 'Iowa way' of campaigning and deciding caucuses. I believe the only way to compete and win in the state of Iowa is to come and spend the time asking the voters for their support, looking them in the eye, having the humility to submit yourself to the men and women of this state,\" his voice racing forward and raising in volume. \"And if a candidate is not doing that, that ought to be an indication.\" \n\nAt event after event in northern Iowa, Cruz was repeatedly confronted by audience members who lodged emotional, and sometimes agitated, complaints about his record on ethanol and desire to eliminate the Renewable Fuel Standard.\nThere was the man in the Casey's General Store in Manly who button-holed Cruz and wouldn't let him go until an aide physically moved the senator onto a different voter. There were the farmers who asked, with a pang of concern, whether there was just something about Cruz's position that they must've misheard.\n\"I'm a corn farmer. I've been following your campaign and I see that you've modified your stance on the RFS,\" Bob Hemesath, a local corn industry leader, asked Cruz in Decorah. \"And in reality, you haven't really modified your stance.\"\nCruz nodded. On that, they agreed.\nRead: For Ted Cruz, the last voter in the room is the hardest\nCruz has tried to pitch Iowans on other parts of his ethanol policy beyond the RFS, most prominently rolling back an EPA regulation that limits the amount of gasoline that can be in an ethanol blend. But these Iowans that Cruz has tried to win over were rarely convinced by those arguments, which they see as B-list concerns to the RFS that Cruz wants to phase out within five years.\nAt nearly every stop, Cruz would motion behind him and point at the best validator he could, Dave VanderGreind, an Iowan ethanol magnate who agreed with Cruz's point that the RFS was not the be-all-end-all.  \nThe campaign wants to keep repeating its message, and when the team was surprised to see no one ask about his position on the RFS in Webster City on Thursday, Rep. Steve King whispered in Cruz's ear.\n\"Alright, so Steve raised one additional question. He said there may be someone here wondering about ethanol,\" Cruz said. \"So let's talk about that for a second.\"\n\nThe scourge of Washington Republicans -- he has few friends in the Senate -- and of critics who label him robotic, harsh and grating, Cruz is offering Iowans a look at a kinder, gentler side in the final weeks before voters here decide his fate. It is his campaign's soft sell, its final attempt to show Republicans that he isn't just right on the issues, but decent enough and homely enough to win their vote.\n\"It's not just smart politics. It's smart relationships,\" said Bob Vander Plaats, who is standing a step behind Cruz at every stop on his bus tour as one of Cruz's top allies in the state. \"You're seeing him being more vulnerable.\" \nWhen a woman in a hotel lobby told Cruz about the death of her son, a veteran who suffered from post-traumatic disorder, the Texas firebrand lowered his voice to something close to a microphoned whisper: \"My mom lost my older brother as an infant,\" he shared.\nAt Dr. Thomas Gleason's Airplane Hangar in Webster City, he told Edith Verman-Frank, a 76-year-old survivor of two simultaneous stage four cancers, that his mother too was a 15-year breast cancer survivor. Two questions later, Cruz was explaining to Jaci Bagwell that he understand her worries about student loans debt -- he only paid off his $100,000 in debt five years ago.\nBut Cruz has worked hard over the past seven months to maintain his standing as the most conservative candidate in the field, and his outpourings of empathy have political limits.\nWhen asked in the hotel lobby in Storm Lake by a young, undocumented woman who said she was troubled by Cruz's new plan that he would deport people like her immediately if elected, Cruz showed no pity. \n\"Well, listen, I would note if you're a DACA recipient, it means that you were brought here illegally,\" Cruz told her as the room grew silent. \"And violating the laws have consequences.\"","gunning_fog_1":"10.0","flesch_1":"8.7","readability_1":"68.1","index_2":"0","title_2":"Bernie Sanders Lunchtime Scoop: ‘Tuna Salad’","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/bernie-sanders-lunchtime-scoop-tuna-salad/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"ST.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said that 22 documents containing “top secret” information will be excluded entirely from the release of Mrs. Clinton’s email archive. So far, more than 1,300 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails have been redacted, with portions blocked out, due to the presence of classified information, but this is the first example of emails being entirely withheld from public release.\nMr. Kirby also said the State Department would conduct an investigation to determine whether the emails were classified at the time they were sent or received on Mrs. Clinton’s personal email server. That marks a shift from the longtime State Department position that any classification was done after the fact. Mr. Kirby added that whether they were classified at the time or not, they didn’t contain markings identifying them as classified. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, wrote on Twitter:  “This is overclassification run amok. We adamantly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails.” Byron Tau reports.\nTHE A-HED: FIGHTING FOR IOWA VOTERS, BERNIE SANDERS LEADS IN YAROSLAVL\nA trip to the Soviet Union in 1988 gave rise in Yaroslavl to a small but ardent Russian outpost of enthusiastic Bernie Sanders fans. Paul Sonne reports.\nWSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS\nINCOME FOR RECENT GRADUATES THE HIGHEST IN OVER A DECADE: The labor market has taken a sharp turn for the better for young college graduates. Incomes for the newest batch of diploma-holders have reached the highest level in more than a decade and their unemployment rates are falling quickly, according to a new economic report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Their experience now underscores a growing divide in the U.S. economybetween those with a college degree and those without. The median holder of a bachelor’s degree, ages 22 to 27, earned $43,000 last year, an increase of over $3,000 from the year before. That is the highest since 2003, showing that the job market for freshly minted graduates has nearly recovered to the best years on record.  Josh Zumbrun reports.\nCENTRAL BANKS TRY UNCONVENTIONAL POLICY TOOLS: Central banks around the world are going to new lengths to boost their economies, underscoring both the importance and limitations of monetary policy in a global economy plagued by paltry growth and unsettled markets.

The move, long denied as a possible course by the banks own governor, came a week after the European Central Bank president said he was ready to launch additional monetary stimulus in March, and just days after the U.S. Federal Reserve expressed renewed worry about market turbulence and sluggish growth overseas.

The economy had advanced 2% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter. Despite weak first and fourth quarters to bookend the year, growth for 2015 as a whole was steady.

That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.4285714285714286},"q1":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.4285714285714286},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7767857142857144},"q4":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.7767857142857144},"q5":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.7767857142857144},"q6":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4285714285714286},"q7":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.7767857142857144},"q8":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6517857142857142},"q9":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.6517857142857142},"q10":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.7767857142857144},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"female","confidence":1.0},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":0.5714285714285714},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"independent_other","confidence":0.7767857142857144},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"hillary_clinton","confidence":0.7767857142857144}}}

Lieberman as the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee in 2000.\n\nThe likely reason: While Mr. Sanders was raised Jewish and even spent time on an Israeli kibbutz in the 1960s, he has been muted in his own embrace of the faith. “Generally the Vermont senator seems uncomfortable with efforts to place a Jewish frame on his candidacy,” The Forward noted.\n\nIsraeli and Jewish media outlets swarmed over news of his victory, analyzing it for its significance good and bad. The Israeli paper Haaretz noted that Mr. Sanders often refers to himself as the son of a Polish immigrant, rather than a Jewish immigrant. “The Jewish establishment has a hard time considering him one of its own,” the paper observed.\n\nAnother Haaretz commentator, Chemi Shalev, worried that Mr. Sanders’ victory, and his firebrand liberal politics, would stoke anti-Semitism: “More than any other Democratic candidate, Sanders fits the bill of the G.O.P.’s favorite Jewish bogeyman, Saul Alinsky.” Mr. Alinsky, considered the father of community organizing, was frequently invoked by conservatives in the 2008 presidential campaign to tar President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who wrote her college dissertation on him.\n\nAnd despite the symbolism of Mr. Sanders’s winning the first-in-the-nation primary, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency played down the significance. The news organization noted before the vote that New Hampshire is one of the nation’s smallest and least diverse states. After Mr. Sanders won, it said, “An estimated 10,000 Jews live in New Hampshire.”\n\nAt his victory address Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders himself did not even note the historic nature of his win.\n\nBut The Forward saw the evening as one for the books. “Tuesday night will go down in history as the first time a Jew won a presidential primary,” the paper wrote.","gunning_fog_3":"8.0","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"56.25","index_4":"58","title_4":"Who's funding this pro-Ted Cruz super PAC?","url_4":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/06/politics/ted-cruz-super-pac/index.html","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"CNN","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) A super PAC spending millions of dollars to bash Ted Cruz's Republican rivals is shielding the names of many of its top donors and strategists, accepting and directing donations through a particularly high number of hard-to-trace companies, new documents reveal. \nStand for Truth, Inc., an emerging player in the orbit of often clashing constellation of pro-Cruz super PACs, recently pledged to air more than $4 million in television ads to back Cruz in Iowa and South Carolina. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions but are required to disclose their financial backers.\nThe twist here is that Stand for Truth has accepted more than $1 million in donations from corporations or limited liability companies, whose funders are difficult to uncover, meaning the original source of the campaign cash is hidden. While corporations can make donations to super PACs, an LLC allows individual donors to steer cash through easy-to-register, self-owned organizations. \n\"LLCs seem to be a new vehicle for laundering money into elections,\" said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance reformer worried about donors essentially using them as shell companies to transfer cash anonymously. \"It's really hard to find out about LLCs. That's one of the reasons they've become popular.\"\nStand for Truth has largely operated quietly, not responding to questions about new television advertisements from media and discarding with the in-the-news public profile maintained by many powerful groups in favor of a sparse website.\nNo leadership beyond the treasurer who filed its federal elections forms, a former counsel to Mitch McConnell named Eric Lycan, has publicly identified itself. Lycan has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN about the group's activities, and he declined to talk by phone this week. He did say in an email on Friday that the group was run by \"consultants from across the country committed to electing a courageous conservative as our next President.\"\nThe main hand behind the super PAC is Josh Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Governors Association who now heads RedPrint Strategy, Lycan confirmed. Another name behind the group, Lycan said, is a Texas strategist named Keats Norfleet, who did not respond to requests for comment. \nOverall, Stand for Truth raised nearly $2.5 million last year in the brief time it had before the December 31 filing deadline. On Thursday, it purchased an additional $800,000 in negative advertisements attacking Marco Rubio in South Carolina.  \nThere is no evidence that routing the LLCs was a coordinated attempt to avoid disclosures, but the amount of cash donated is substantial.\nOf the 29 individual contributions made to the group between Nov. 20 and Dec. 31, more than half of the gifts were not immediately connectable to an individual donor, the FEC report shows. On December 21, for instance, five seemingly identical donations in equal increments of $50,000 came from five different LLCs -- \"LL Baltimore, LLC\"; \"LL Fort Wayne, LLC\"; \"LL Peoria, LLC\"; \"\"LL West Allis, LLC' and \"PF Fort Myers LLC.\"\nMany of the individuals plotting the group's plans remain unknown as well. The individuals receiving payment from Stand for Truth are all being paid through similar entities, with all but one company receiving payment using a limited liability companies or a limited liability partnership to accept the funds. \n\nIt is not uncommon for vendors to receive payments from campaigns through groups like these, and some of those firms are easily identifiable, such Lycan's Kentucky-based law firm, Dinsmore and Shohl.\nBut LLCs are more difficult to crack. The Texas-based \"Stalwart Advisory LLC\" and Robinson's \"One Harbor LLC\" that the group used as consultants are not visible to the public without sleuthing through Texas public records. Stalwart Advisory does not appear in any state's corporate records, according to OpenCorporates.com, which tracks these filings, nor does One Harbor's ties to Robinson.\nLycan, asked why so much of the group's intake and outflow of cash were conducted through these LLC's declined to directly answer.\n\"Stand for Truth reports the information for each donor from whom a contribution is received, in accordance with applicable law,\" he wrote in an email.\nDonors are increasingly using LLCs like these to give to political groups ever since the Citizens United decision made it easier for non-individuals to cut checks. But the prevalence of these opaque companies on Stand for Truth's report is widespread, campaign finance observers say. \n\"The super PAC probably gets more corporate funding than most do by a pretty big margin, but still the bigger donors are individuals,\" said David Keating of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group advocating for looser restrictions on donations. \"This isn't Exxon Mobil corporate funding.\" \nStand for Truth, meant to add to menu of choices for high-dollar donors, has so far focused on negative television advertisements aimed at both Rubio and Donald Trump. A leading force behind the group, Lycan confirmed, is Hal Lambert, a Dallas money-manager who was a co-chair of the official campaign's finance committee until he started the outside group and is a close ally of Willie Langston, the Houston campaign's finance chair. \nAnd largely funding the group is Adam and Tara Ross, a Dallas couple close to Ted and Heidi Cruz who together gave $1 million of the $2.5 million raised.

He is making clear that with challenges including global warming, economic inequality and the still-open Guantanamo Bay prison, he will use every last ounce of authority and influence left to get things done.\nObama to focus on future in his final State of the Union speech\n\"I want us to be able, when we walk out this door, to say, 'We couldn't think of anything else that we didn't try to do ... that we weren't timid or got tired or somehow thinking about the next thing because there is no next thing,' \" he said in a pre-State of the Union video released on Monday.\nBut for all the promises of an engaged 2016, there's no getting around the fact that in just one year and eight days, Obama must cede the power to protect what he sees as his greatest achievements, including health care reform, staying out of Middle East quagmires and advancing social justice issues such as gay rights and economic prosperity.\nThere is no doubt that Obama has an awful lot riding on Clinton capturing the White House -- although he has also met with her left-wing rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the White House said Monday.\nA Democratic successor is imperative for Obama because Republicans have vowed to dismantle key aspects of the Obama legacy immediately if they win back the presidential mansion after eight years, including Obamacare, a nuclear deal with Iran, executive actions shielding immigrants and policies designed to slow or reverse climate change.\n\nThough the White House says Obama will not endorse a candidate in the 2016 primary race, there is no doubt that he has long seen Clinton as the best hope for preserving his legacy. \nIn fact, that belief was one reason many people in the administration's inner circle were wary of a run by Vice President Joe Biden.\n\"I think Barack Obama believes that it is incredibly important that Hillary Cinton succeeds him,\" said a former close aide to Obama who is still connected with the White House. \"The only way that we have an economy where people aren't losing their health care is if Hillary Clinton becomes president.\"\nJeff Shesol, who is familiar with the dynamic between a president and his preferred successor after working in the final years of the Clinton White House as a speechwriter, including on the State of the Union address, highlighted Obama's reliance on Clinton for his place in history.\n\"The single most important thing that could happen from here on out for the Obama legacy is the election of Hillary Clinton,\" he said.\nOn one level, the fact that Obama hopes to entrust his legacy to Clinton is richly ironic. After all, a rejection of the kind of politics of \"division and distraction\" that he hinted that the Clintons helped sow was a strong thematic undercurrent of his 2008 election campaign.\nBut over the years, after working closely with Clinton when she was his secretary of state and as his prickly relationship with Bill Clinton eased during the former president's important embrace of his 2012 re-election campaign, it's been clear that Obama and his West Wing see the rival he slayed in 2008 as the best bet to safeguard his achievements.\nObama, for instance, was effusive in his praise of his outgoing secretary of state when she left office in 2013. He has continued to meet her for occasional private lunches at the White House and members of his orbit who once decried the Clintons now privately and publicly advocate for her.\nFor instance, David Plouffe, his one-time political guru who outmaneuvered the Clinton campaign in 2008, wrote in an eye-opening op-ed on Medium in October that she would make an \"outstanding and worthy successor.\"\n\nThe question for Clinton, as she faces a closer-than-expected race with Sanders and a potentially tight general election, is how much Obama helps her as she seeks to mobilize the Obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 but tries to mitigate the impact of his political failings.\nThe former secretary of state is touting the administration's record on the economy, with the halving of the unemployment rate and progress on gay rights, health care and climate change -- issues that are important to the Democratic base and the Obama hordes of young, affluent, educated white voters and minorities that she needs to turn out.\nShe is, meanwhile, vowing to go further than Obama on reforming the immigration system and to be more energetic on preventing gun violence. \nBut any downturn in the economy during his last year could render the President's record less impressive and harm her own chances.\nObama's struggles to impose U.S. power in the restive Middle East and elsewhere help fuel a Republican narrative that his foreign policy is a bust, to which she is vulnerable as his first-term secretary of state.\nClinton has already signaled she would go further than Obama in Syria, in tackling ISIS, in mending relations with Israel and in adopting a tougher stance toward Iran, Russia and China than Obama has pursued. The Clinton campaign declined to comment on how Obama's foreign policy legacy will impact Clinton. But aides have previously quarreled with the Republican contention that her time as secretary of state will be a liability.\nClinton has also broken with Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which is opposed by many union leaders and grassroots Democrats. She backed the deal as secretary of state but now says does too little to protect the American worker.\nHer move on TPP is one indication of why it is so hard for a candidate of the same party to succeed a two-term president -- a feat so rare that it's only been done once, by George H.W. Bush, since World War II.\nClinton has a firm interest in the incumbent President doing well, but she must also create a campaign in her own right that protects her from his baggage. It was a trick, for example, that Vice President Al Gore failed to pull off as he sought to succeed President Bill Clinton in 2000.\nThat's one reason Clinton has a clear interest in Obama's State of the Union address heralding a strong 2016 for the President.\nSources who know both Clinton and Obama say that the relationship between the President and Clinton remains friendly and cooperative. That will be tested, however, if Clinton is the nominee and as Obama faces pressure to recede into the background before the fall campaign. Awkwardness is bound to flair between the two camps, especially if Clinton finds herself obliged to begin criticizing aspects of his record for her own political reasons.\n\n\"I think there is tension inherently because you have a president who is still president who has certain points that he wants to press and certain directions he wants to lead and he wants his successor to go,\" said Shesol. \"He probably has a good deal of confidence in his political judgment and thinks he knows best.\"\nHe continued, \"There have been very few presidents who just wanted to get the hell out of there. President Obama doesn't want to stop being president. If we didn't have a 22nd Amendment, I am sure he would be running again.\"\nThe requirement for an incumbent president to step back -- a process that begins Tuesday night -- is not an easy one, and it requires him to bite his tongue in some situations when his preferred successor deems it necessary to criticize him.\nDemocrats to colleagues: Bring Muslims to State of the Union\nFor instance, in an interview with the Des Moines Editorial Board on Monday, the former New York senator said she would improve on Obama's tortured relationship with Congress.\n\"I have much more experience doing it. At the end of the day, you have to build those relations and consistently be looking for common ground,\" Clinton said.\nBut in the case of Obama and Clinton, the tension may be eased by the fact that there is now substantial cross-pollination between the two camps.\nTwo senior aides to the former first lady -- her communications director Jennifer Palmieri and the campaign's chairman John Podesta -- worked in the White House in recent years, and other lower-level staffers also have a foot in both camps.\nAnd if there are strains in execution, they will pale in comparison with the common goals that Obama and Clinton share -- and which the President will lay out in Tuesday's prime-time address.","gunning_fog_5":"13.2","flesch_5":"13.0","readability_5":"51.52","gold_title":" This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest","gold_url":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The Guardian","gold_body":"t’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.708333333333333,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T11:20:12+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1953181195,"created_at":"2016-04-08T10:42:27+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T10:41:50+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NV","city":"Las Vegas","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915111,"worker_id":32672123,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.844444444444444,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"0","g2":"1","q1":"1","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"1","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"0","q9":"0","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"5","index_1":"9","title_1":"Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.\nAt the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.\nThey were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long.

Lieberman as the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee in 2000.\n\nThe likely reason: While Mr. Sanders was raised Jewish and even spent time on an Israeli kibbutz in the 1960s, he has been muted in his own embrace of the faith. “Generally the Vermont senator seems uncomfortable with efforts to place a Jewish frame on his candidacy,” The Forward noted.\n\nIsraeli and Jewish media outlets swarmed over news of his victory, analyzing it for its significance good and bad. The Israeli paper Haaretz noted that Mr. Sanders often refers to himself as the son of a Polish immigrant, rather than a Jewish immigrant. “The Jewish establishment has a hard time considering him one of its own,” the paper observed.\n\nAnother Haaretz commentator, Chemi Shalev, worried that Mr. Sanders’ victory, and his firebrand liberal politics, would stoke anti-Semitism: “More than any other Democratic candidate, Sanders fits the bill of the G.O.P.’s favorite Jewish bogeyman, Saul Alinsky.” Mr. Alinsky, considered the father of community organizing, was frequently invoked by conservatives in the 2008 presidential campaign to tar President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who wrote her college dissertation on him.\n\nAnd despite the symbolism of Mr. Sanders’s winning the first-in-the-nation primary, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency played down the significance. The news organization noted before the vote that New Hampshire is one of the nation’s smallest and least diverse states. After Mr. Sanders won, it said, “An estimated 10,000 Jews live in New Hampshire.”\n\nAt his victory address Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders himself did not even note the historic nature of his win.\n\nBut The Forward saw the evening as one for the books. “Tuesday night will go down in history as the first time a Jew won a presidential primary,” the paper wrote.","gunning_fog_3":"8.0","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"56.25","index_4":"58","title_4":"Who's funding this pro-Ted Cruz super PAC?","url_4":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/06/politics/ted-cruz-super-pac/index.html","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"CNN","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) A super PAC spending millions of dollars to bash Ted Cruz's Republican rivals is shielding the names of many of its top donors and strategists, accepting and directing donations through a particularly high number of hard-to-trace companies, new documents reveal. \nStand for Truth, Inc., an emerging player in the orbit of often clashing constellation of pro-Cruz super PACs, recently pledged to air more than $4 million in television ads to back Cruz in Iowa and South Carolina. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions but are required to disclose their financial backers.\nThe twist here is that Stand for Truth has accepted more than $1 million in donations from corporations or limited liability companies, whose funders are difficult to uncover, meaning the original source of the campaign cash is hidden. While corporations can make donations to super PACs, an LLC allows individual donors to steer cash through easy-to-register, self-owned organizations. \n\"LLCs seem to be a new vehicle for laundering money into elections,\" said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance reformer worried about donors essentially using them as shell companies to transfer cash anonymously. \"It's really hard to find out about LLCs. That's one of the reasons they've become popular.\"\nStand for Truth has largely operated quietly, not responding to questions about new television advertisements from media and discarding with the in-the-news public profile maintained by many powerful groups in favor of a sparse website.\nNo leadership beyond the treasurer who filed its federal elections forms, a former counsel to Mitch McConnell named Eric Lycan, has publicly identified itself. Lycan has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN about the group's activities, and he declined to talk by phone this week. He did say in an email on Friday that the group was run by \"consultants from across the country committed to electing a courageous conservative as our next President.\"\nThe main hand behind the super PAC is Josh Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Governors Association who now heads RedPrint Strategy, Lycan confirmed. Another name behind the group, Lycan said, is a Texas strategist named Keats Norfleet, who did not respond to requests for comment. \nOverall, Stand for Truth raised nearly $2.5 million last year in the brief time it had before the December 31 filing deadline. On Thursday, it purchased an additional $800,000 in negative advertisements attacking Marco Rubio in South Carolina.  \nThere is no evidence that routing the LLCs was a coordinated attempt to avoid disclosures, but the amount of cash donated is substantial.\nOf the 29 individual contributions made to the group between Nov. 20 and Dec. 31, more than half of the gifts were not immediately connectable to an individual donor, the FEC report shows. On December 21, for instance, five seemingly identical donations in equal increments of $50,000 came from five different LLCs -- \"LL Baltimore, LLC\"; \"LL Fort Wayne, LLC\"; \"LL Peoria, LLC\"; \"\"LL West Allis, LLC' and \"PF Fort Myers LLC.\"\nMany of the individuals plotting the group's plans remain unknown as well. The individuals receiving payment from Stand for Truth are all being paid through similar entities, with all but one company receiving payment using a limited liability companies or a limited liability partnership to accept the funds. \n\nIt is not uncommon for vendors to receive payments from campaigns through groups like these, and some of those firms are easily identifiable, such Lycan's Kentucky-based law firm, Dinsmore and Shohl.\nBut LLCs are more difficult to crack. The Texas-based \"Stalwart Advisory LLC\" and Robinson's \"One Harbor LLC\" that the group used as consultants are not visible to the public without sleuthing through Texas public records. Stalwart Advisory does not appear in any state's corporate records, according to OpenCorporates.com, which tracks these filings, nor does One Harbor's ties to Robinson.\nLycan, asked why so much of the group's intake and outflow of cash were conducted through these LLC's declined to directly answer.\n\"Stand for Truth reports the information for each donor from whom a contribution is received, in accordance with applicable law,\" he wrote in an email.\nDonors are increasingly using LLCs like these to give to political groups ever since the Citizens United decision made it easier for non-individuals to cut checks. But the prevalence of these opaque companies on Stand for Truth's report is widespread, campaign finance observers say. \n\"The super PAC probably gets more corporate funding than most do by a pretty big margin, but still the bigger donors are individuals,\" said David Keating of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group advocating for looser restrictions on donations. \"This isn't Exxon Mobil corporate funding.\" \nStand for Truth, meant to add to menu of choices for high-dollar donors, has so far focused on negative television advertisements aimed at both Rubio and Donald Trump. A leading force behind the group, Lycan confirmed, is Hal Lambert, a Dallas money-manager who was a co-chair of the official campaign's finance committee until he started the outside group and is a close ally of Willie Langston, the Houston campaign's finance chair. \nAnd largely funding the group is Adam and Tara Ross, a Dallas couple close to Ted and Heidi Cruz who together gave $1 million of the $2.5 million raised. Adam Ross is influential in Jewish Republican fundraising circles and is said to be close with Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who has remained on the sidelines this year despite being wooed by much of the GOP field. \nThe super PACs supporting Cruz that have been blessed by the candidate himself, a network titled Keep the Promise, has not used virtually any of these LLCs.

Bernie Sanders, the White House said Monday.\nA Democratic successor is imperative for Obama because Republicans have vowed to dismantle key aspects of the Obama legacy immediately if they win back the presidential mansion after eight years, including Obamacare, a nuclear deal with Iran, executive actions shielding immigrants and policies designed to slow or reverse climate change.\n\nThough the White House says Obama will not endorse a candidate in the 2016 primary race, there is no doubt that he has long seen Clinton as the best hope for preserving his legacy. \nIn fact, that belief was one reason many people in the administration's inner circle were wary of a run by Vice President Joe Biden.\n\"I think Barack Obama believes that it is incredibly important that Hillary Cinton succeeds him,\" said a former close aide to Obama who is still connected with the White House. \"The only way that we have an economy where people aren't losing their health care is if Hillary Clinton becomes president.\"\nJeff Shesol, who is familiar with the dynamic between a president and his preferred successor after working in the final years of the Clinton White House as a speechwriter, including on the State of the Union address, highlighted Obama's reliance on Clinton for his place in history.\n\"The single most important thing that could happen from here on out for the Obama legacy is the election of Hillary Clinton,\" he said.\nOn one level, the fact that Obama hopes to entrust his legacy to Clinton is richly ironic. After all, a rejection of the kind of politics of \"division and distraction\" that he hinted that the Clintons helped sow was a strong thematic undercurrent of his 2008 election campaign.\nBut over the years, after working closely with Clinton when she was his secretary of state and as his prickly relationship with Bill Clinton eased during the former president's important embrace of his 2012 re-election campaign, it's been clear that Obama and his West Wing see the rival he slayed in 2008 as the best bet to safeguard his achievements.\nObama, for instance, was effusive in his praise of his outgoing secretary of state when she left office in 2013. He has continued to meet her for occasional private lunches at the White House and members of his orbit who once decried the Clintons now privately and publicly advocate for her.\nFor instance, David Plouffe, his one-time political guru who outmaneuvered the Clinton campaign in 2008, wrote in an eye-opening op-ed on Medium in October that she would make an \"outstanding and worthy successor.\"\n\nThe question for Clinton, as she faces a closer-than-expected race with Sanders and a potentially tight general election, is how much Obama helps her as she seeks to mobilize the Obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 but tries to mitigate the impact of his political failings.\nThe former secretary of state is touting the administration's record on the economy, with the halving of the unemployment rate and progress on gay rights, health care and climate change -- issues that are important to the Democratic base and the Obama hordes of young, affluent, educated white voters and minorities that she needs to turn out.\nShe is, meanwhile, vowing to go further than Obama on reforming the immigration system and to be more energetic on preventing gun violence. \nBut any downturn in the economy during his last year could render the President's record less impressive and harm her own chances.\nObama's struggles to impose U.S. power in the restive Middle East and elsewhere help fuel a Republican narrative that his foreign policy is a bust, to which she is vulnerable as his first-term secretary of state.\nClinton has already signaled she would go further than Obama in Syria, in tackling ISIS, in mending relations with Israel and in adopting a tougher stance toward Iran, Russia and China than Obama has pursued. The Clinton campaign declined to comment on how Obama's foreign policy legacy will impact Clinton. But aides have previously quarreled with the Republican contention that her time as secretary of state will be a liability.\nClinton has also broken with Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which is opposed by many union leaders and grassroots Democrats. She backed the deal as secretary of state but now says does too little to protect the American worker.\nHer move on TPP is one indication of why it is so hard for a candidate of the same party to succeed a two-term president -- a feat so rare that it's only been done once, by George H.W. Bush, since World War II.\nClinton has a firm interest in the incumbent President doing well, but she must also create a campaign in her own right that protects her from his baggage. It was a trick, for example, that Vice President Al Gore failed to pull off as he sought to succeed President Bill Clinton in 2000.\nThat's one reason Clinton has a clear interest in Obama's State of the Union address heralding a strong 2016 for the President.\nSources who know both Clinton and Obama say that the relationship between the President and Clinton remains friendly and cooperative. That will be tested, however, if Clinton is the nominee and as Obama faces pressure to recede into the background before the fall campaign. Awkwardness is bound to flair between the two camps, especially if Clinton finds herself obliged to begin criticizing aspects of his record for her own political reasons.\n\n\"I think there is tension inherently because you have a president who is still president who has certain points that he wants to press and certain directions he wants to lead and he wants his successor to go,\" said Shesol. \"He probably has a good deal of confidence in his political judgment and thinks he knows best.\"\nHe continued, \"There have been very few presidents who just wanted to get the hell out of there. President Obama doesn't want to stop being president. If we didn't have a 22nd Amendment, I am sure he would be running again.\"\nThe requirement for an incumbent president to step back -- a process that begins Tuesday night -- is not an easy one, and it requires him to bite his tongue in some situations when his preferred successor deems it necessary to criticize him.\nDemocrats to colleagues: Bring Muslims to State of the Union\nFor instance, in an interview with the Des Moines Editorial Board on Monday, the former New York senator said she would improve on Obama's tortured relationship with Congress.\n\"I have much more experience doing it. At the end of the day, you have to build those relations and consistently be looking for common ground,\" Clinton said.\nBut in the case of Obama and Clinton, the tension may be eased by the fact that there is now substantial cross-pollination between the two camps.\nTwo senior aides to the former first lady -- her communications director Jennifer Palmieri and the campaign's chairman John Podesta -- worked in the White House in recent years, and other lower-level staffers also have a foot in both camps.\nAnd if there are strains in execution, they will pale in comparison with the common goals that Obama and Clinton share -- and which the President will lay out in Tuesday's prime-time address.","gunning_fog_5":"13.2","flesch_5":"13.0","readability_5":"51.52","gold_title":" This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest","gold_url":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The Guardian","gold_body":"t’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}},{"id":1953204044,"created_at":"2016-04-08T11:18:13+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T11:11:36+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"instagc","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"TN","city":"Knoxville","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915111,"worker_id":18386513,"trust":0.65625,"worker_trust":0.915625,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"-2","q1":"0","q2":"0","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"0","q6":"1","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"0","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"ted_cruz"},"unit_data":{"nil":"5","index_1":"9","title_1":"Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.\nAt the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.\nThey were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long.

Lieberman as the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee in 2000.\n\nThe likely reason: While Mr. Sanders was raised Jewish and even spent time on an Israeli kibbutz in the 1960s, he has been muted in his own embrace of the faith. “Generally the Vermont senator seems uncomfortable with efforts to place a Jewish frame on his candidacy,” The Forward noted.\n\nIsraeli and Jewish media outlets swarmed over news of his victory, analyzing it for its significance good and bad. The Israeli paper Haaretz noted that Mr. Sanders often refers to himself as the son of a Polish immigrant, rather than a Jewish immigrant. “The Jewish establishment has a hard time considering him one of its own,” the paper observed.\n\nAnother Haaretz commentator, Chemi Shalev, worried that Mr. Sanders’ victory, and his firebrand liberal politics, would stoke anti-Semitism: “More than any other Democratic candidate, Sanders fits the bill of the G.O.P.’s favorite Jewish bogeyman, Saul Alinsky.” Mr. Alinsky, considered the father of community organizing, was frequently invoked by conservatives in the 2008 presidential campaign to tar President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who wrote her college dissertation on him.\n\nAnd despite the symbolism of Mr. Sanders’s winning the first-in-the-nation primary, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency played down the significance. The news organization noted before the vote that New Hampshire is one of the nation’s smallest and least diverse states. After Mr. Sanders won, it said, “An estimated 10,000 Jews live in New Hampshire.”\n\nAt his victory address Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders himself did not even note the historic nature of his win.\n\nBut The Forward saw the evening as one for the books. “Tuesday night will go down in history as the first time a Jew won a presidential primary,” the paper wrote.","gunning_fog_3":"8.0","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"56.25","index_4":"58","title_4":"Who's funding this pro-Ted Cruz super PAC?","url_4":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/06/politics/ted-cruz-super-pac/index.html","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"CNN","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) A super PAC spending millions of dollars to bash Ted Cruz's Republican rivals is shielding the names of many of its top donors and strategists, accepting and directing donations through a particularly high number of hard-to-trace companies, new documents reveal. \nStand for Truth, Inc., an emerging player in the orbit of often clashing constellation of pro-Cruz super PACs, recently pledged to air more than $4 million in television ads to back Cruz in Iowa and South Carolina. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions but are required to disclose their financial backers.\nThe twist here is that Stand for Truth has accepted more than $1 million in donations from corporations or limited liability companies, whose funders are difficult to uncover, meaning the original source of the campaign cash is hidden. While corporations can make donations to super PACs, an LLC allows individual donors to steer cash through easy-to-register, self-owned organizations. \n\"LLCs seem to be a new vehicle for laundering money into elections,\" said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance reformer worried about donors essentially using them as shell companies to transfer cash anonymously. \"It's really hard to find out about LLCs. That's one of the reasons they've become popular.\"\nStand for Truth has largely operated quietly, not responding to questions about new television advertisements from media and discarding with the in-the-news public profile maintained by many powerful groups in favor of a sparse website.\nNo leadership beyond the treasurer who filed its federal elections forms, a former counsel to Mitch McConnell named Eric Lycan, has publicly identified itself. Lycan has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN about the group's activities, and he declined to talk by phone this week. He did say in an email on Friday that the group was run by \"consultants from across the country committed to electing a courageous conservative as our next President.\"\nThe main hand behind the super PAC is Josh Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Governors Association who now heads RedPrint Strategy, Lycan confirmed. Another name behind the group, Lycan said, is a Texas strategist named Keats Norfleet, who did not respond to requests for comment. \nOverall, Stand for Truth raised nearly $2.5 million last year in the brief time it had before the December 31 filing deadline. On Thursday, it purchased an additional $800,000 in negative advertisements attacking Marco Rubio in South Carolina.  \nThere is no evidence that routing the LLCs was a coordinated attempt to avoid disclosures, but the amount of cash donated is substantial.\nOf the 29 individual contributions made to the group between Nov. 20 and Dec. 31, more than half of the gifts were not immediately connectable to an individual donor, the FEC report shows. On December 21, for instance, five seemingly identical donations in equal increments of $50,000 came from five different LLCs -- \"LL Baltimore, LLC\"; \"LL Fort Wayne, LLC\"; \"LL Peoria, LLC\"; \"\"LL West Allis, LLC' and \"PF Fort Myers LLC.\"\nMany of the individuals plotting the group's plans remain unknown as well. The individuals receiving payment from Stand for Truth are all being paid through similar entities, with all but one company receiving payment using a limited liability companies or a limited liability partnership to accept the funds. \n\nIt is not uncommon for vendors to receive payments from campaigns through groups like these, and some of those firms are easily identifiable, such Lycan's Kentucky-based law firm, Dinsmore and Shohl.\nBut LLCs are more difficult to crack. The Texas-based \"Stalwart Advisory LLC\" and Robinson's \"One Harbor LLC\" that the group used as consultants are not visible to the public without sleuthing through Texas public records. Stalwart Advisory does not appear in any state's corporate records, according to OpenCorporates.com, which tracks these filings, nor does One Harbor's ties to Robinson.\nLycan, asked why so much of the group's intake and outflow of cash were conducted through these LLC's declined to directly answer.\n\"Stand for Truth reports the information for each donor from whom a contribution is received, in accordance with applicable law,\" he wrote in an email.\nDonors are increasingly using LLCs like these to give to political groups ever since the Citizens United decision made it easier for non-individuals to cut checks. But the prevalence of these opaque companies on Stand for Truth's report is widespread, campaign finance observers say. \n\"The super PAC probably gets more corporate funding than most do by a pretty big margin, but still the bigger donors are individuals,\" said David Keating of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group advocating for looser restrictions on donations. \"This isn't Exxon Mobil corporate funding.\" \nStand for Truth, meant to add to menu of choices for high-dollar donors, has so far focused on negative television advertisements aimed at both Rubio and Donald Trump. A leading force behind the group, Lycan confirmed, is Hal Lambert, a Dallas money-manager who was a co-chair of the official campaign's finance committee until he started the outside group and is a close ally of Willie Langston, the Houston campaign's finance chair. \nAnd largely funding the group is Adam and Tara Ross, a Dallas couple close to Ted and Heidi Cruz who together gave $1 million of the $2.5 million raised. Adam Ross is influential in Jewish Republican fundraising circles and is said to be close with Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who has remained on the sidelines this year despite being wooed by much of the GOP field. \nThe super PACs supporting Cruz that have been blessed by the candidate himself, a network titled Keep the Promise, has not used virtually any of these LLCs. The $40 million raised by Keep the Promise almost entirely comes from three families that each gave more than $10 million to support Cruz through their own independent groups -- with their names attached.","gunning_fog_4":"10.8","flesch_4":"11.9","readability_4":"49.15","index_5":"83","title_5":"Obama hopes to pave way for Clinton with SOTU","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/12/politics/barack-obama-hillary-clinton-2016-election/index.html","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_5":"Washington (CNN) It's time for President Barack Obama to start letting go.\nWhile aides say the commander in chief will argue in his final State of the Union address Tuesday that America's destiny depends on honoring progress made on his watch, he will be sketching a future in which he will play no major political role.\nSo his speech -- likely his last opportunity to grab an hour of uninterrupted prime time -- marks an important first step in a delicate and bittersweet yearlong process of handing over his legacy to the protective custody of his hoped-for successor, fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nFor sure, Obama has no intention of striding off the political stage just yet -- a factor that could complicate his relations with the Democratic front-runner in the coming months.

He has continued to meet her for occasional private lunches at the White House and members of his orbit who once decried the Clintons now privately and publicly advocate for her.\nFor instance, David Plouffe, his one-time political guru who outmaneuvered the Clinton campaign in 2008, wrote in an eye-opening op-ed on Medium in October that she would make an \"outstanding and worthy successor.\"\n\nThe question for Clinton, as she faces a closer-than-expected race with Sanders and a potentially tight general election, is how much Obama helps her as she seeks to mobilize the Obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 but tries to mitigate the impact of his political failings.\nThe former secretary of state is touting the administration's record on the economy, with the halving of the unemployment rate and progress on gay rights, health care and climate change -- issues that are important to the Democratic base and the Obama hordes of young, affluent, educated white voters and minorities that she needs to turn out.\nShe is, meanwhile, vowing to go further than Obama on reforming the immigration system and to be more energetic on preventing gun violence. \nBut any downturn in the economy during his last year could render the President's record less impressive and harm her own chances.\nObama's struggles to impose U.S. power in the restive Middle East and elsewhere help fuel a Republican narrative that his foreign policy is a bust, to which she is vulnerable as his first-term secretary of state.\nClinton has already signaled she would go further than Obama in Syria, in tackling ISIS, in mending relations with Israel and in adopting a tougher stance toward Iran, Russia and China than Obama has pursued. The Clinton campaign declined to comment on how Obama's foreign policy legacy will impact Clinton. But aides have previously quarreled with the Republican contention that her time as secretary of state will be a liability.\nClinton has also broken with Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which is opposed by many union leaders and grassroots Democrats. She backed the deal as secretary of state but now says does too little to protect the American worker.\nHer move on TPP is one indication of why it is so hard for a candidate of the same party to succeed a two-term president -- a feat so rare that it's only been done once, by George H.W. Bush, since World War II.\nClinton has a firm interest in the incumbent President doing well, but she must also create a campaign in her own right that protects her from his baggage. It was a trick, for example, that Vice President Al Gore failed to pull off as he sought to succeed President Bill Clinton in 2000.\nThat's one reason Clinton has a clear interest in Obama's State of the Union address heralding a strong 2016 for the President.\nSources who know both Clinton and Obama say that the relationship between the President and Clinton remains friendly and cooperative. That will be tested, however, if Clinton is the nominee and as Obama faces pressure to recede into the background before the fall campaign. Awkwardness is bound to flair between the two camps, especially if Clinton finds herself obliged to begin criticizing aspects of his record for her own political reasons.\n\n\"I think there is tension inherently because you have a president who is still president who has certain points that he wants to press and certain directions he wants to lead and he wants his successor to go,\" said Shesol. \"He probably has a good deal of confidence in his political judgment and thinks he knows best.\"\nHe continued, \"There have been very few presidents who just wanted to get the hell out of there. President Obama doesn't want to stop being president. If we didn't have a 22nd Amendment, I am sure he would be running again.\"\nThe requirement for an incumbent president to step back -- a process that begins Tuesday night -- is not an easy one, and it requires him to bite his tongue in some situations when his preferred successor deems it necessary to criticize him.\nDemocrats to colleagues: Bring Muslims to State of the Union\nFor instance, in an interview with the Des Moines Editorial Board on Monday, the former New York senator said she would improve on Obama's tortured relationship with Congress.\n\"I have much more experience doing it. At the end of the day, you have to build those relations and consistently be looking for common ground,\" Clinton said.\nBut in the case of Obama and Clinton, the tension may be eased by the fact that there is now substantial cross-pollination between the two camps.\nTwo senior aides to the former first lady -- her communications director Jennifer Palmieri and the campaign's chairman John Podesta -- worked in the White House in recent years, and other lower-level staffers also have a foot in both camps.\nAnd if there are strains in execution, they will pale in comparison with the common goals that Obama and Clinton share -- and which the President will lay out in Tuesday's prime-time address.","gunning_fog_5":"13.2","flesch_5":"13.0","readability_5":"51.52","gold_title":" This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest","gold_url":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The Guardian","gold_body":"t’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}},{"id":1953205478,"created_at":"2016-04-08T11:20:00+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T11:09:17+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NC","city":"Jacksonville","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915111,"worker_id":7333195,"trust":0.6875,"worker_trust":0.927402638190955,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"-2","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"1","q6":"1","q7":"-1","q8":"0","q9":"1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"ted_cruz"},"unit_data":{"nil":"5","index_1":"9","title_1":"Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.\nAt the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.\nThey were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long.

Lieberman as the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee in 2000.\n\nThe likely reason: While Mr. Sanders was raised Jewish and even spent time on an Israeli kibbutz in the 1960s, he has been muted in his own embrace of the faith. “Generally the Vermont senator seems uncomfortable with efforts to place a Jewish frame on his candidacy,” The Forward noted.\n\nIsraeli and Jewish media outlets swarmed over news of his victory, analyzing it for its significance good and bad. The Israeli paper Haaretz noted that Mr. Sanders often refers to himself as the son of a Polish immigrant, rather than a Jewish immigrant. “The Jewish establishment has a hard time considering him one of its own,” the paper observed.\n\nAnother Haaretz commentator, Chemi Shalev, worried that Mr. Sanders’ victory, and his firebrand liberal politics, would stoke anti-Semitism: “More than any other Democratic candidate, Sanders fits the bill of the G.O.P.’s favorite Jewish bogeyman, Saul Alinsky.” Mr. Alinsky, considered the father of community organizing, was frequently invoked by conservatives in the 2008 presidential campaign to tar President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who wrote her college dissertation on him.\n\nAnd despite the symbolism of Mr. Sanders’s winning the first-in-the-nation primary, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency played down the significance. The news organization noted before the vote that New Hampshire is one of the nation’s smallest and least diverse states. After Mr. Sanders won, it said, “An estimated 10,000 Jews live in New Hampshire.”\n\nAt his victory address Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders himself did not even note the historic nature of his win.\n\nBut The Forward saw the evening as one for the books. “Tuesday night will go down in history as the first time a Jew won a presidential primary,” the paper wrote.","gunning_fog_3":"8.0","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"56.25","index_4":"58","title_4":"Who's funding this pro-Ted Cruz super PAC?","url_4":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/06/politics/ted-cruz-super-pac/index.html","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"CNN","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) A super PAC spending millions of dollars to bash Ted Cruz's Republican rivals is shielding the names of many of its top donors and strategists, accepting and directing donations through a particularly high number of hard-to-trace companies, new documents reveal. \nStand for Truth, Inc., an emerging player in the orbit of often clashing constellation of pro-Cruz super PACs, recently pledged to air more than $4 million in television ads to back Cruz in Iowa and South Carolina. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions but are required to disclose their financial backers.\nThe twist here is that Stand for Truth has accepted more than $1 million in donations from corporations or limited liability companies, whose funders are difficult to uncover, meaning the original source of the campaign cash is hidden. While corporations can make donations to super PACs, an LLC allows individual donors to steer cash through easy-to-register, self-owned organizations. \n\"LLCs seem to be a new vehicle for laundering money into elections,\" said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance reformer worried about donors essentially using them as shell companies to transfer cash anonymously. \"It's really hard to find out about LLCs. That's one of the reasons they've become popular.\"\nStand for Truth has largely operated quietly, not responding to questions about new television advertisements from media and discarding with the in-the-news public profile maintained by many powerful groups in favor of a sparse website.\nNo leadership beyond the treasurer who filed its federal elections forms, a former counsel to Mitch McConnell named Eric Lycan, has publicly identified itself. Lycan has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN about the group's activities, and he declined to talk by phone this week. He did say in an email on Friday that the group was run by \"consultants from across the country committed to electing a courageous conservative as our next President.\"\nThe main hand behind the super PAC is Josh Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Governors Association who now heads RedPrint Strategy, Lycan confirmed. Another name behind the group, Lycan said, is a Texas strategist named Keats Norfleet, who did not respond to requests for comment. \nOverall, Stand for Truth raised nearly $2.5 million last year in the brief time it had before the December 31 filing deadline. On Thursday, it purchased an additional $800,000 in negative advertisements attacking Marco Rubio in South Carolina.  \nThere is no evidence that routing the LLCs was a coordinated attempt to avoid disclosures, but the amount of cash donated is substantial.\nOf the 29 individual contributions made to the group between Nov. 20 and Dec. 31, more than half of the gifts were not immediately connectable to an individual donor, the FEC report shows. On December 21, for instance, five seemingly identical donations in equal increments of $50,000 came from five different LLCs -- \"LL Baltimore, LLC\"; \"LL Fort Wayne, LLC\"; \"LL Peoria, LLC\"; \"\"LL West Allis, LLC' and \"PF Fort Myers LLC.\"\nMany of the individuals plotting the group's plans remain unknown as well. The individuals receiving payment from Stand for Truth are all being paid through similar entities, with all but one company receiving payment using a limited liability companies or a limited liability partnership to accept the funds. \n\nIt is not uncommon for vendors to receive payments from campaigns through groups like these, and some of those firms are easily identifiable, such Lycan's Kentucky-based law firm, Dinsmore and Shohl.\nBut LLCs are more difficult to crack. The Texas-based \"Stalwart Advisory LLC\" and Robinson's \"One Harbor LLC\" that the group used as consultants are not visible to the public without sleuthing through Texas public records. Stalwart Advisory does not appear in any state's corporate records, according to OpenCorporates.com, which tracks these filings, nor does One Harbor's ties to Robinson.\nLycan, asked why so much of the group's intake and outflow of cash were conducted through these LLC's declined to directly answer.\n\"Stand for Truth reports the information for each donor from whom a contribution is received, in accordance with applicable law,\" he wrote in an email.\nDonors are increasingly using LLCs like these to give to political groups ever since the Citizens United decision made it easier for non-individuals to cut checks. But the prevalence of these opaque companies on Stand for Truth's report is widespread, campaign finance observers say. \n\"The super PAC probably gets more corporate funding than most do by a pretty big margin, but still the bigger donors are individuals,\" said David Keating of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group advocating for looser restrictions on donations. \"This isn't Exxon Mobil corporate funding.\" \nStand for Truth, meant to add to menu of choices for high-dollar donors, has so far focused on negative television advertisements aimed at both Rubio and Donald Trump. A leading force behind the group, Lycan confirmed, is Hal Lambert, a Dallas money-manager who was a co-chair of the official campaign's finance committee until he started the outside group and is a close ally of Willie Langston, the Houston campaign's finance chair. \nAnd largely funding the group is Adam and Tara Ross, a Dallas couple close to Ted and Heidi Cruz who together gave $1 million of the $2.5 million raised. Adam Ross is influential in Jewish Republican fundraising circles and is said to be close with Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who has remained on the sidelines this year despite being wooed by much of the GOP field. \nThe super PACs supporting Cruz that have been blessed by the candidate himself, a network titled Keep the Promise, has not used virtually any of these LLCs. The $40 million raised by Keep the Promise almost entirely comes from three families that each gave more than $10 million to support Cruz through their own independent groups -- with their names attached.","gunning_fog_4":"10.8","flesch_4":"11.9","readability_4":"49.15","index_5":"83","title_5":"Obama hopes to pave way for Clinton with SOTU","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/12/politics/barack-obama-hillary-clinton-2016-election/index.html","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_5":"Washington (CNN) It's time for President Barack Obama to start letting go.\nWhile aides say the commander in chief will argue in his final State of the Union address Tuesday that America's destiny depends on honoring progress made on his watch, he will be sketching a future in which he will play no major political role.\nSo his speech -- likely his last opportunity to grab an hour of uninterrupted prime time -- marks an important first step in a delicate and bittersweet yearlong process of handing over his legacy to the protective custody of his hoped-for successor, fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nFor sure, Obama has no intention of striding off the political stage just yet -- a factor that could complicate his relations with the Democratic front-runner in the coming months. He is making clear that with challenges including global warming, economic inequality and the still-open Guantanamo Bay prison, he will use every last ounce of authority and influence left to get things done.\nObama to focus on future in his final State of the Union speech\n\"I want us to be able, when we walk out this door, to say, 'We couldn't think of anything else that we didn't try to do ... that we weren't timid or got tired or somehow thinking about the next thing because there is no next thing,' \" he said in a pre-State of the Union video released on Monday.\nBut for all the promises of an engaged 2016, there's no getting around the fact that in just one year and eight days, Obama must cede the power to protect what he sees as his greatest achievements, including health care reform, staying out of Middle East quagmires and advancing social justice issues such as gay rights and economic prosperity.\nThere is no doubt that Obama has an awful lot riding on Clinton capturing the White House -- although he has also met with her left-wing rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the White House said Monday.\nA Democratic successor is imperative for Obama because Republicans have vowed to dismantle key aspects of the Obama legacy immediately if they win back the presidential mansion after eight years, including Obamacare, a nuclear deal with Iran, executive actions shielding immigrants and policies designed to slow or reverse climate change.\n\nThough the White House says Obama will not endorse a candidate in the 2016 primary race, there is no doubt that he has long seen Clinton as the best hope for preserving his legacy. \nIn fact, that belief was one reason many people in the administration's inner circle were wary of a run by Vice President Joe Biden.\n\"I think Barack Obama believes that it is incredibly important that Hillary Cinton succeeds him,\" said a former close aide to Obama who is still connected with the White House. \"The only way that we have an economy where people aren't losing their health care is if Hillary Clinton becomes president.\"\nJeff Shesol, who is familiar with the dynamic between a president and his preferred successor after working in the final years of the Clinton White House as a speechwriter, including on the State of the Union address, highlighted Obama's reliance on Clinton for his place in history.\n\"The single most important thing that could happen from here on out for the Obama legacy is the election of Hillary Clinton,\" he said.\nOn one level, the fact that Obama hopes to entrust his legacy to Clinton is richly ironic. After all, a rejection of the kind of politics of \"division and distraction\" that he hinted that the Clintons helped sow was a strong thematic undercurrent of his 2008 election campaign.\nBut over the years, after working closely with Clinton when she was his secretary of state and as his prickly relationship with Bill Clinton eased during the former president's important embrace of his 2012 re-election campaign, it's been clear that Obama and his West Wing see the rival he slayed in 2008 as the best bet to safeguard his achievements.\nObama, for instance, was effusive in his praise of his outgoing secretary of state when she left office in 2013. He has continued to meet her for occasional private lunches at the White House and members of his orbit who once decried the Clintons now privately and publicly advocate for her.\nFor instance, David Plouffe, his one-time political guru who outmaneuvered the Clinton campaign in 2008, wrote in an eye-opening op-ed on Medium in October that she would make an \"outstanding and worthy successor.\"\n\nThe question for Clinton, as she faces a closer-than-expected race with Sanders and a potentially tight general election, is how much Obama helps her as she seeks to mobilize the Obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 but tries to mitigate the impact of his political failings.\nThe former secretary of state is touting the administration's record on the economy, with the halving of the unemployment rate and progress on gay rights, health care and climate change -- issues that are important to the Democratic base and the Obama hordes of young, affluent, educated white voters and minorities that she needs to turn out.\nShe is, meanwhile, vowing to go further than Obama on reforming the immigration system and to be more energetic on preventing gun violence. \nBut any downturn in the economy during his last year could render the President's record less impressive and harm her own chances.\nObama's struggles to impose U.S. power in the restive Middle East and elsewhere help fuel a Republican narrative that his foreign policy is a bust, to which she is vulnerable as his first-term secretary of state.\nClinton has already signaled she would go further than Obama in Syria, in tackling ISIS, in mending relations with Israel and in adopting a tougher stance toward Iran, Russia and China than Obama has pursued. The Clinton campaign declined to comment on how Obama's foreign policy legacy will impact Clinton. But aides have previously quarreled with the Republican contention that her time as secretary of state will be a liability.\nClinton has also broken with Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which is opposed by many union leaders and grassroots Democrats. She backed the deal as secretary of state but now says does too little to protect the American worker.\nHer move on TPP is one indication of why it is so hard for a candidate of the same party to succeed a two-term president -- a feat so rare that it's only been done once, by George H.W. Bush, since World War II.\nClinton has a firm interest in the incumbent President doing well, but she must also create a campaign in her own right that protects her from his baggage. It was a trick, for example, that Vice President Al Gore failed to pull off as he sought to succeed President Bill Clinton in 2000.\nThat's one reason Clinton has a clear interest in Obama's State of the Union address heralding a strong 2016 for the President.\nSources who know both Clinton and Obama say that the relationship between the President and Clinton remains friendly and cooperative. That will be tested, however, if Clinton is the nominee and as Obama faces pressure to recede into the background before the fall campaign. Awkwardness is bound to flair between the two camps, especially if Clinton finds herself obliged to begin criticizing aspects of his record for her own political reasons.\n\n\"I think there is tension inherently because you have a president who is still president who has certain points that he wants to press and certain directions he wants to lead and he wants his successor to go,\" said Shesol. \"He probably has a good deal of confidence in his political judgment and thinks he knows best.\"\nHe continued, \"There have been very few presidents who just wanted to get the hell out of there. President Obama doesn't want to stop being president. If we didn't have a 22nd Amendment, I am sure he would be running again.\"\nThe requirement for an incumbent president to step back -- a process that begins Tuesday night -- is not an easy one, and it requires him to bite his tongue in some situations when his preferred successor deems it necessary to criticize him.\nDemocrats to colleagues: Bring Muslims to State of the Union\nFor instance, in an interview with the Des Moines Editorial Board on Monday, the former New York senator said she would improve on Obama's tortured relationship with Congress.\n\"I have much more experience doing it. At the end of the day, you have to build those relations and consistently be looking for common ground,\" Clinton said.\nBut in the case of Obama and Clinton, the tension may be eased by the fact that there is now substantial cross-pollination between the two camps.\nTwo senior aides to the former first lady -- her communications director Jennifer Palmieri and the campaign's chairman John Podesta -- worked in the White House in recent years, and other lower-level staffers also have a foot in both camps.\nAnd if there are strains in execution, they will pale in comparison with the common goals that Obama and Clinton share -- and which the President will lay out in Tuesday's prime-time address.","gunning_fog_5":"13.2","flesch_5":"13.0","readability_5":"51.52","gold_title":" This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest","gold_url":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The Guardian","gold_body":"t’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5733333333333334},"g2":{"agg":"-2","confidence":0.5733333333333334},"q1":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5733333333333334},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.72},"q3":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q4":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q5":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.72},"q6":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q7":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.4266666666666667},"q8":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.72},"q9":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7066666666666667},"q10":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5733333333333334},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"female","confidence":0.5733333333333334},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"3049","confidence":1.0},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":0.4266666666666667},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"ted_cruz","confidence":0.5733333333333334}}}

Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN's Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump.\nCruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union\" that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S.\n \n\"No, I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,\" Cruz told Tapper as his campaign bus ambled across northern Iowa.\nTrump has promised to authorize a \"deportation force\" to remove those immigrants from the U.S., pledging to do it \"humanely.\" Trump has repeatedly charged that Cruz is merely copying his immigration positions, but Cruz has called his plan \"the most aggressive\" in the GOP field.\nEarlier this week, BuzzFeed captured Cruz on video arguing that his plan was stronger than Trump's because he would not allow those back into the U.S., while Trump's would.\nBut on the actual act of deportation, Cruz is taking a softer tact. \n\"We don't have any system that knocks on the doors of every person in America,\" Cruz told Tapper. \"We also don't have people going door-to-door looking for murderers. We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement.\"\nCruz indicated that he would only deport those who are apprehended, such as those who commit crimes or are caught by prospective employers without having immigrated legally. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement or Border Patrol agents could also apprehend those along the border.\nCruz's comments come at a time when President Barack Obama is coming under fire from some progressives for his administration's recent deportations of families back to unstable Central American countries. Some Democrats, including Reps. Linda Sanchez and Luis Gutierrez, argue that the families should be regarded as refugees, not immigrants.\nFor much of the campaign, Cruz has repeatedly declined to outline what he would do with the undocumented immigrants. But as his debate with Marco Rubio on immigration grew more heated, Cruz definitively ruled out a path to legal status and then has slowly offered more details about how he would deport those already here.\nCruz also said he did not believe those convicted of domestic abuse should be allowed to buy a firearm, and added that the White House's reluctance to use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\" -- a decision Cruz ties to political correctness -- has directly caused a loss of life.\n \nHe also rejected fears of a GOP electoral wipeout in November if he is the nominee, arguing that history makes clear that moderate Republicans have never fared well in presidential elections. \n\"Every time we do it we get clobbered,\" Cruz said. \"You know, this is no longer a theory. You know, as they say in the tech world, this has been beta-tested.\"","gunning_fog_1":"9.2","flesch_1":"9.1","readability_1":"61.67","index_2":"32","title_2":"Behind Ted Cruz’s Campaign Manager, Scorched Earth and Election Victories","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/us/politics/ted-cruz-campaign-manager-jeff-roe.html","candidate_2":"Ted Cruz","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"For weeks, the labels have hung over Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign like dirty laundry: Deceitful. Cynical. Willing to do anything to win.\n\nThe attacks from Mr. Cruz’s Republican rivals have challenged his core campaign promises of integrity and conservative purity, cresting on Monday when he dismissed his communications director, Rick Tyler, for spreading a misleading video about Marco Rubio’s views on the Bible.\n\n“There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom,” a Rubio spokesman said, “that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty.”\n\nThe episode threatened to tarnish Mr. Cruz’s brand. But not his campaign manager’s.\n\nAs Mr. Cruz has elbowed into the top tier of candidates, his campaign has conspicuously reflected the brand of its principal architect: Jeff Roe, an operative with a reputation for scorching earth, stretching truths and winning elections.\n\n“When you win campaigns,” Mr. Cruz said last month of the man he hired, “the people that lose tend to be unhappy about it.”\n\nMr. Roe’s home state, Missouri, teems with people who were made unhappy by him.\n\nAt 45, with lumbering swagger and drawling parables culled from the family farm, Mr. Roe has steered Mr. Cruz’s onetime long-shot presidential bid into contention.\n\nMr. Roe’s message has been consistent: Mr. Cruz is the most conservative candidate. His turnout operation is perhaps without peer. He all but guaranteed victory in Iowa, boasting to disbelieving reporters that they would be wasting their time to prepare articles on a Cruz loss.\n\nIt was Mr. Roe who hired Mr. Tyler to be the Texas senator’s campaign spokesman. (In an interview this month, Mr. Tyler said he had “learned a lot” from Mr. Roe. “Jeff wins,” Mr. Tyler said, adding, “I don’t think anything we’ve done is underhanded or deceptive or anything like that.”)\n\nBut back home, Mr. Roe’s allies and opponents alike have seen a familiar imprint in the Cruz campaign’s recent exploits, which have included a Photoshopped image of Mr. Rubio and the misleading suggestion, on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that Ben Carson was leaving the race.\n\nThere was the time, in 2006, when Mr. Roe ran an ad flashing “XXX” to highlight a 63-year-old, wheelchair-using congressional candidate’s former employer’s association with Penthouse magazine. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.\n\nLong before Mr. Cruz tweaked Mr. Trump’s “New York values,” Mr. Roe condemned the “San Francisco-style values” of another opponent in a 2008 ad featuring an ostentatiously dressed black man dancing with two women. Some criticized the spot as racist and homophobic. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.\n\nHe was among the first local operatives to tail opponents with camera-wielding trackers and, a decade ago, to investigate the social media pages of candidates and their children.\n\nHe has been known to quote Gandhi and ran a blog that trafficked in sometimes-sourced political gossip.\n\n“Jeff Roe does not know the difference between fact and fiction,” said Joe Brazil, a county councilman in Missouri who unsuccessfully sued Mr. Roe for defamation after a 2006 blog post days before Mr. Brazil’s primary in a State Senate race.\n\nThe item focused on a sad event from Mr. Brazil’s youth, when, at 17, he killed a classmate in a dump-truck accident. Mr. Roe’s post suggested Mr. Brazil had consumed “quite a few beers.” But Mr. Brazil had not been drinking, the police said, and was not charged.\n\nAfter watching coverage of the Iowa caucuses from his home in Augusta, Mo., Mr. Brazil said he tried to reach the Carson campaign, hoping to offer a history lesson.\n\n“How could they be surprised?” he asked.\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Roe’s clients and current colleagues vigorously defended his ethics. He has helped elect or re-elect 41 members of Congress, six senators and five governors. Surely, supporters say, hurt feelings are to be expected.\n\n“Jeff Roe likes to win,” said Representative Martha E. McSally of Arizona, who won her seat in 2014 by 167 votes.\n\n“Jeff is very intimidating, and he kind of likes that,” said Rod Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker.\n\n“Sometimes he makes people a little bit squeamish,” said Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, Mr. Roe’s mentor. “It is what it is.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s first experience with Mr. Roe came during his Senate run in Texas in 2012. Mr. Roe’s firm, working for Mr. Cruz’s opponent, produced a flier attacking Mr. Cruz’s legal work for a Chinese company. It made an impression, though Mr. Cruz won.\n\nMr. Roe, who declined to be interviewed, was quick to establish a distinctive culture at Mr. Cruz’s headquarters in Houston. Top aides were required to move there. (Mr. Roe brought along his wife, Missy, the 2010 winner of the Mrs. Missouri United States pageant; their baby, Remington, named in part for the gun maker; and Mrs. Roe’s parents.)\n\nMeetings begin when he sounds a siren on a bullhorn. They last 10 to 12 minutes, largely because the participants stand. And Roe family wisdom is often heard:\n\n“Get the corn down where the chickens can eat it.”\n\n“If you have a bunch of frogs to eat, eat the biggest one first.”\n\n“When it’s raining soup, put a bowl on your head.”\n\nThough Mr. Roe and Mr. Cruz share a conservative vision, there are differences between the candidate and his message maker.\n\nMr. Cruz is a practitioner of the filibuster; Mr. Roe is pithy and profane.\n\nMr. Cruz was an Ivy League debate champion; Mr. Roe worked on his family’s hog farm before joining the National Guard at 17, training with howitzers.\n\nMr. Cruz tracks his daily exercise habits on a Fitbit; Mr. Roe is built like a baseball umpire, which was once his dream job, and he chews Red Man Golden Blend tobacco, holstering a plastic soda bottle as a spittoon.\n\nMr. Roe started in politics in 1994, working on Mr. Graves’s election to the State Senate. But umpiring remained a passion. He practiced calling third strikes in the office, using a flourish he called “the chain saw.” He was once heckled at a high school game by the Hall of Famer Whitey Herzog, whose grandson was pitching.\n\nIn 1996, he was invited to major league umpiring school. He declined, reluctantly.\n\n“In the back of his mind, he still wonders, would I have made a great umpire?” Mr. Graves said.\n\nWhen Mr. Graves reached Congress, Mr. Roe became his chief of staff, occasionally earning the ire of the Bush White House. At one administration briefing for the Missouri delegation around 2002, Mr. Roe took issue with an agricultural proposal.\n\n“That’s just bad politics,” he said.\n\nA voice behind Mr. Roe objected. Mr. Roe pressed on, according to several people who recalled the scene, without bothering to face the man.\n\n“That’s just completely out of touch without the reality of Missouri politics,” he repeated.\n\nHe was talking to Karl Rove.\n\nIn 2005, Mr. Roe left Washington to start a political consulting firm in Missouri. His first presidential work was for Mike Huckabee in 2008; in 2012, he consulted for Rick Perry.\n\nBut as Mr. Roe prepared to manage his first presidential bid for Mr. Cruz last February, he faced new scrutiny at home. Days after he ran a radio ad mocking the physical appearance of Tom Schweich, a primary candidate for Missouri governor, by comparing him to Barney Fife, Mr. Schweich committed suicide.\n\nPeers said Mr. Schweich had faced many demons; he also thought the chairman of the state’s Republican Party had falsely spread word that he was Jewish. But some Missouri leaders viewed the ad as a last straw, casting Mr. Roe as the avatar of a toxic campaign culture.\n\n“Politics has gone so hideously wrong,” John C. Danforth, the state’s former three-term United States senator, said as he eulogized Mr. Schweich.\n\nMr. Roe has expressed condolences to Mr. Schweich’s family and horror at the death, but he betrayed little regret for the ad itself.\n\n“I live in the windshield,” he told The New Republic. “I don’t live in the rearview mirror.”\n\nSuch has been his response through the years, more or less, to questions of whether his tactics were fair or foul.\n\nStill, colleagues and even opponents have said Mr. Roe is capable of introspection, of inspiring loyalty and, among competitors, of engendering respect.\n\nMr. Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker, said he had long since lost touch with Mr. Roe, a friend-turned-adversary, when Mr. Jetton was arrested and charged with assault in 2009, eventually pleading guilty and being placed on probation; in 2010, he faced a grand jury investigation over questions of bribery, though he was not indicted.\n\nOut of the blue, Mr. Jetton received a text from Mr. Roe. “He said, ‘Hey, politics is one thing, but this kind of stuff, you don’t wish for anybody,’ ” Mr. Jetton recalled. “I don’t know that I would have done that for him.”","gunning_fog_2":"6.4","flesch_2":"5.2","readability_2":"77.23","index_3":"36","title_3":"First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: The Tattooed Hunk Had a Familiar Face","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/09/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-the-tattooed-hunk-had-a-familiar-face/","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa.

Invest in retail. Organize pastors. Tend to homeschoolers. Win the two big nods. Get outside of Des Moines.\nDespite Trump's unconventional campaign, and attacks from the billionaire that included questioning Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his being born in Canada, unaligned operatives until the last moments here remained certain that the core of Iowa caucus politics had not changed, despite Trump's unconventional campaign. \n\"Iowa has sent notice,\" Cruz said Monday night, \"that the Republican nominee of the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment, will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force, where all sovereignty resides in our nation, by we the people, the American people.\"\nCruz's team, basking in victory, projected more confidence than ever before that a strong showing in New Hampshire was within reach. Spokesman Rick Tyler pointed to Cruz's cash on hand, lapping the field by a considerable margin, and said it would put Cruz in a far better position than Marco Rubio and others in the Granite State -- even as they conceded Rubio now entered with momentum.\n\nIt was a victory set into motion two and a half years ago, when Cruz first touched down at the Des Moines Marriott -- only six months after he had been sworn into the Senate. \nCruz was known at the time for ideological purity -- not evangelical fervor -- but over the next few years, he would add to his Christian image, citing Scripture repeatedly in barns and convenience stores as he became more and more tailor-made for Iowa Republicans.\nOn that first trip here in August 2013, he met with a network of influential Iowa pastors, the same group he returned to last Monday, just a week before clergymen like them would help decide his fate. And he built his own network of evangelical pastors, recruiting one chief in each county and integrating them into a state leadership team that dwarfed other candidates' in size. \nFor much of 2015, Cruz visited Iowa consistently, but not overwhelmingly. He thumbed his nose at GOP rivals who essentially moved to the state in search of lightning strike. But he invested in face time, lingering late on a baseball diamond the day of the gay marriage decision in June and at a high-profile evangelical forum in November on one particularly long Iowa day.\nAnd he deliberately and conscientiously identified, courted and landed the two major conservative endorsements behind past Iowa winners, Rep. Steve King and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats, who together have been a road show for Cruz during his visits here over the past two months. \nTheir endorsements coincided with Cruz's first major surge in Iowa surveys, culminating with Cruz taking the lead in a Des Moines Register poll in mid-December. With King, he had a provocative spokesperson and a validator in the intense boxing match with the ethanol lobby. With Vander Plaats, he had a networker who could stick around to win over the weary (\"It's not that we dislike Santorum,\" he told one voter on the way out the door Saturday.)\n\nCruz, who had worked hard to tamper expectations, had inadvertently raised them.\n\"You see the poll?\" Jeff King, the congressman's son, who leads the Cruz super PAC operation here in Iowa, remembers saying to another group official then. \"We're going to have to do well in Iowa.\"\nCruz's wager on Iowa stood in contrast to his closest rivals: Trump and Rubio, both of whom are expected to do better in New Hampshire than the Texas senator.\n\"When he started this thing, he was nowhere,\" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz, standing on a chair as an overflow Cruz crowd surrounded him in Ames. \"I would use this campaign to teach others how to run a race.\" \nMonday morning, the Texan's campaign bus ambled to a basketball court in this Greene County town along the Raccoon River to pay heed to Iowa's most revered custom: the \"Full Grassley,\" or the pledge to visit all 99 counties, named for Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\"Whatever campaign techniques were used by the campaign that has won, maybe this was the year for that,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, the state's GOP chair. \"But I don't think retail politics, building a political machine and doing all 99 counties is every going to be out of date in this state.\"\nTrump spent a total of two nights in Iowa hotels, jetting in and out on a private plane for a rally every few days. Rubio blanketed the state in television ads, seeing campaign events as not as efficient a use of time as a Fox News hit or a super PAC media buy. Cruz aides stress that they layered a serious data and paid media campaign onto the infrastructure, but the bedrock of Cruz's bid here was a strategy that was more timeworn than innovative.\nVisiting every corner of Iowa doesn't guarantee anything, however. Mick Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who won the 2008 and 2012 GOP caucuses, respectively, barnstormed the state and came away at the bottom of the pack. Huckabee dropped out before the night was over.\n\"It will say as much about the process as it does about the outcome,\" said Joseph McReynolds, a Cruz fundraiser and activist, as he observed his candidate work a tiny town two days before voting.\nUp to the final hours in Iowa, Cruz's team maintained a sense of serenity, believing that the outcome's fate was largely out of their hands. Their voters would turn out. The big question that would decide the race was whether Trump's would -- and that was not in the Cruz campaign's control. \n\nThere was considerable worry among Cruz allies and donors that their candidate made the same mistake that bedeviled previous Iowa losers: that he peaked too early. \nCruz began a slow rise in Iowa polls in mid-October, but by the time he topped them in early January, he had invited the scorn of as many as seven outside groups, and nearly every candidate, including Trump, who was raising scornful questions about Cruz's eligibility to be president.\nIn addition to Trump's intense trolling and prodding in television interviews, Twitter and other free media, Cruz's campaign estimates that the senator was pummeled by $8 million in attack ads last month.\nAnd some allies and donors concede that those weeks -- rather than days -- on defense took its toll, including concerns pushed by the state's ethanol lobby, who led voters to badger Cruz at nearly every town hall in the homestretch of the Iowa campaign. Supporters differ on the number of points shaved by the ethanol offensive, but they admit it broke through.\nSome friends, in retrospect, say the campaign could have been more aggressive toward Trump and earlier. Yet most argue that avoiding Trump's scorn was the closest thing the campaign had to a masterstroke -- nearly every candidate who attacked Trump, of course, crashed.\nIt was a calculation they never thought they'd have to make. Cruz's win involved a fair amount of luck: Many of the candidates once likely to be top rivals here -- whether it was Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- fizzled entirely. When asked in June about the candidate competing with him most prominently in the evangelical lane, Cruz pointed to a candidate who ended up flirting with invisibility and dropped out Monday night: Mike Huckabee. \nIn the final moments, an old threat reappeared: Rubio. Trump had pulled away in some early polls, and Rubio began to inch up in some public polls. Cruz's super PACs, both weary Rubio's rise but also seeing his supporters as soft, began to target him aggressively. The campaign reassigned all of its advertising in the final days to hold off Rubio, once a vanquished opponent, instead.\nJohn Thompson, an unaligned Iowa GOP central committee member, said Cruz undoubtedly faded in the final weeks here. But the fundamentals of Cruz's bid, he said, charted a new Iowa path.\n\"He took the best out of every textbook that's ever been written,\" Thompson said, \"and I think he made a new game.\"","gunning_fog_4":"11.2","flesch_4":"11.1","readability_4":"56.59","index_5":"113","title_5":"BORDERLINE ACCURATE Trump camp defends using African migrants in 'wall' ad","url_5":"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/05/trump-criticized-for-campaign-ad-showing-southern-border-using-footage-morocco.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"Fox News","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s new television ad showing dozens of people swarming over a border fence is being criticized by a prominent fact-checker for using footage from a Spanish autonomous city that shares a border with Morocco. \nThe ad features a narrator who says of Trump, \"He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for,” as images show people streaming across a border fence. \nPolitiFact said the footage comes from the Italian television network RepubblicaTV, which posted video on May 3, 2015 of Moroccans crossing the border into the Spanish city of Melilla. \n\"Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over 'our southern border.'

Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.75,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T01:06:08+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952839095,"created_at":"2016-04-07T23:25:07+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T23:24:11+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"OH","city":"Columbus","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915112,"worker_id":33280016,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":1.0,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"-1","g2":"1","q1":"-1","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"-1","q5":"0","q6":"0","q7":"1","q8":"0","q9":"1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"other"},"unit_data":{"nil":"6","index_1":"53","title_1":"Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented immigrants","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-deportation-guns-terrorism/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"(CNN) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN's Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump.\nCruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union\" that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S.\n \n\"No, I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,\" Cruz told Tapper as his campaign bus ambled across northern Iowa.\nTrump has promised to authorize a \"deportation force\" to remove those immigrants from the U.S., pledging to do it \"humanely.\" Trump has repeatedly charged that Cruz is merely copying his immigration positions, but Cruz has called his plan \"the most aggressive\" in the GOP field.\nEarlier this week, BuzzFeed captured Cruz on video arguing that his plan was stronger than Trump's because he would not allow those back into the U.S., while Trump's would.\nBut on the actual act of deportation, Cruz is taking a softer tact. \n\"We don't have any system that knocks on the doors of every person in America,\" Cruz told Tapper. \"We also don't have people going door-to-door looking for murderers. We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement.\"\nCruz indicated that he would only deport those who are apprehended, such as those who commit crimes or are caught by prospective employers without having immigrated legally. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement or Border Patrol agents could also apprehend those along the border.\nCruz's comments come at a time when President Barack Obama is coming under fire from some progressives for his administration's recent deportations of families back to unstable Central American countries. Some Democrats, including Reps. Linda Sanchez and Luis Gutierrez, argue that the families should be regarded as refugees, not immigrants.\nFor much of the campaign, Cruz has repeatedly declined to outline what he would do with the undocumented immigrants. But as his debate with Marco Rubio on immigration grew more heated, Cruz definitively ruled out a path to legal status and then has slowly offered more details about how he would deport those already here.\nCruz also said he did not believe those convicted of domestic abuse should be allowed to buy a firearm, and added that the White House's reluctance to use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\" -- a decision Cruz ties to political correctness -- has directly caused a loss of life.\n \nHe also rejected fears of a GOP electoral wipeout in November if he is the nominee, arguing that history makes clear that moderate Republicans have never fared well in presidential elections. \n\"Every time we do it we get clobbered,\" Cruz said. \"You know, this is no longer a theory. You know, as they say in the tech world, this has been beta-tested.\"","gunning_fog_1":"9.2","flesch_1":"9.1","readability_1":"61.67","index_2":"32","title_2":"Behind Ted Cruz’s Campaign Manager, Scorched Earth and Election Victories","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/us/politics/ted-cruz-campaign-manager-jeff-roe.html","candidate_2":"Ted Cruz","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"For weeks, the labels have hung over Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign like dirty laundry: Deceitful. Cynical. Willing to do anything to win.\n\nThe attacks from Mr. Cruz’s Republican rivals have challenged his core campaign promises of integrity and conservative purity, cresting on Monday when he dismissed his communications director, Rick Tyler, for spreading a misleading video about Marco Rubio’s views on the Bible.\n\n“There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom,” a Rubio spokesman said, “that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty.”\n\nThe episode threatened to tarnish Mr. Cruz’s brand. But not his campaign manager’s.\n\nAs Mr. Cruz has elbowed into the top tier of candidates, his campaign has conspicuously reflected the brand of its principal architect: Jeff Roe, an operative with a reputation for scorching earth, stretching truths and winning elections.\n\n“When you win campaigns,” Mr. Cruz said last month of the man he hired, “the people that lose tend to be unhappy about it.”\n\nMr. Roe’s home state, Missouri, teems with people who were made unhappy by him.\n\nAt 45, with lumbering swagger and drawling parables culled from the family farm, Mr. Roe has steered Mr. Cruz’s onetime long-shot presidential bid into contention.\n\nMr. Roe’s message has been consistent: Mr. Cruz is the most conservative candidate. His turnout operation is perhaps without peer. He all but guaranteed victory in Iowa, boasting to disbelieving reporters that they would be wasting their time to prepare articles on a Cruz loss.\n\nIt was Mr. Roe who hired Mr. Tyler to be the Texas senator’s campaign spokesman. (In an interview this month, Mr. Tyler said he had “learned a lot” from Mr. Roe. “Jeff wins,” Mr. Tyler said, adding, “I don’t think anything we’ve done is underhanded or deceptive or anything like that.”)\n\nBut back home, Mr. Roe’s allies and opponents alike have seen a familiar imprint in the Cruz campaign’s recent exploits, which have included a Photoshopped image of Mr. Rubio and the misleading suggestion, on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that Ben Carson was leaving the race.\n\nThere was the time, in 2006, when Mr. Roe ran an ad flashing “XXX” to highlight a 63-year-old, wheelchair-using congressional candidate’s former employer’s association with Penthouse magazine. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.\n\nLong before Mr. Cruz tweaked Mr. Trump’s “New York values,” Mr. Roe condemned the “San Francisco-style values” of another opponent in a 2008 ad featuring an ostentatiously dressed black man dancing with two women. Some criticized the spot as racist and homophobic. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.\n\nHe was among the first local operatives to tail opponents with camera-wielding trackers and, a decade ago, to investigate the social media pages of candidates and their children.\n\nHe has been known to quote Gandhi and ran a blog that trafficked in sometimes-sourced political gossip.\n\n“Jeff Roe does not know the difference between fact and fiction,” said Joe Brazil, a county councilman in Missouri who unsuccessfully sued Mr. Roe for defamation after a 2006 blog post days before Mr. Brazil’s primary in a State Senate race.\n\nThe item focused on a sad event from Mr. Brazil’s youth, when, at 17, he killed a classmate in a dump-truck accident. Mr. Roe’s post suggested Mr. Brazil had consumed “quite a few beers.” But Mr. Brazil had not been drinking, the police said, and was not charged.\n\nAfter watching coverage of the Iowa caucuses from his home in Augusta, Mo., Mr. Brazil said he tried to reach the Carson campaign, hoping to offer a history lesson.\n\n“How could they be surprised?” he asked.\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Roe’s clients and current colleagues vigorously defended his ethics. He has helped elect or re-elect 41 members of Congress, six senators and five governors. Surely, supporters say, hurt feelings are to be expected.\n\n“Jeff Roe likes to win,” said Representative Martha E. McSally of Arizona, who won her seat in 2014 by 167 votes.\n\n“Jeff is very intimidating, and he kind of likes that,” said Rod Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker.\n\n“Sometimes he makes people a little bit squeamish,” said Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, Mr. Roe’s mentor. “It is what it is.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s first experience with Mr. Roe came during his Senate run in Texas in 2012. Mr. Roe’s firm, working for Mr. Cruz’s opponent, produced a flier attacking Mr. Cruz’s legal work for a Chinese company. It made an impression, though Mr. Cruz won.\n\nMr. Roe, who declined to be interviewed, was quick to establish a distinctive culture at Mr. Cruz’s headquarters in Houston. Top aides were required to move there. (Mr. Roe brought along his wife, Missy, the 2010 winner of the Mrs. Missouri United States pageant; their baby, Remington, named in part for the gun maker; and Mrs. Roe’s parents.)\n\nMeetings begin when he sounds a siren on a bullhorn. They last 10 to 12 minutes, largely because the participants stand. And Roe family wisdom is often heard:\n\n“Get the corn down where the chickens can eat it.”\n\n“If you have a bunch of frogs to eat, eat the biggest one first.”\n\n“When it’s raining soup, put a bowl on your head.”\n\nThough Mr. Roe and Mr. Cruz share a conservative vision, there are differences between the candidate and his message maker.\n\nMr. Cruz is a practitioner of the filibuster; Mr. Roe is pithy and profane.\n\nMr. Cruz was an Ivy League debate champion; Mr. Roe worked on his family’s hog farm before joining the National Guard at 17, training with howitzers.\n\nMr. Cruz tracks his daily exercise habits on a Fitbit; Mr. Roe is built like a baseball umpire, which was once his dream job, and he chews Red Man Golden Blend tobacco, holstering a plastic soda bottle as a spittoon.\n\nMr. Roe started in politics in 1994, working on Mr. Graves’s election to the State Senate. But umpiring remained a passion. He practiced calling third strikes in the office, using a flourish he called “the chain saw.” He was once heckled at a high school game by the Hall of Famer Whitey Herzog, whose grandson was pitching.\n\nIn 1996, he was invited to major league umpiring school. He declined, reluctantly.\n\n“In the back of his mind, he still wonders, would I have made a great umpire?” Mr. Graves said.\n\nWhen Mr. Graves reached Congress, Mr. Roe became his chief of staff, occasionally earning the ire of the Bush White House. At one administration briefing for the Missouri delegation around 2002, Mr. Roe took issue with an agricultural proposal.\n\n“That’s just bad politics,” he said.\n\nA voice behind Mr. Roe objected. Mr. Roe pressed on, according to several people who recalled the scene, without bothering to face the man.\n\n“That’s just completely out of touch without the reality of Missouri politics,” he repeated.\n\nHe was talking to Karl Rove.\n\nIn 2005, Mr. Roe left Washington to start a political consulting firm in Missouri. His first presidential work was for Mike Huckabee in 2008; in 2012, he consulted for Rick Perry.\n\nBut as Mr. Roe prepared to manage his first presidential bid for Mr. Cruz last February, he faced new scrutiny at home. Days after he ran a radio ad mocking the physical appearance of Tom Schweich, a primary candidate for Missouri governor, by comparing him to Barney Fife, Mr. Schweich committed suicide.\n\nPeers said Mr. Schweich had faced many demons; he also thought the chairman of the state’s Republican Party had falsely spread word that he was Jewish. But some Missouri leaders viewed the ad as a last straw, casting Mr. Roe as the avatar of a toxic campaign culture.\n\n“Politics has gone so hideously wrong,” John C. Danforth, the state’s former three-term United States senator, said as he eulogized Mr. Schweich.\n\nMr. Roe has expressed condolences to Mr. Schweich’s family and horror at the death, but he betrayed little regret for the ad itself.\n\n“I live in the windshield,” he told The New Republic. “I don’t live in the rearview mirror.”\n\nSuch has been his response through the years, more or less, to questions of whether his tactics were fair or foul.\n\nStill, colleagues and even opponents have said Mr. Roe is capable of introspection, of inspiring loyalty and, among competitors, of engendering respect.\n\nMr. Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker, said he had long since lost touch with Mr. Roe, a friend-turned-adversary, when Mr. Jetton was arrested and charged with assault in 2009, eventually pleading guilty and being placed on probation; in 2010, he faced a grand jury investigation over questions of bribery, though he was not indicted.\n\nOut of the blue, Mr. Jetton received a text from Mr. Roe. “He said, ‘Hey, politics is one thing, but this kind of stuff, you don’t wish for anybody,’ ” Mr. Jetton recalled. “I don’t know that I would have done that for him.”","gunning_fog_2":"6.4","flesch_2":"5.2","readability_2":"77.23","index_3":"36","title_3":"First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: The Tattooed Hunk Had a Familiar Face","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/09/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-the-tattooed-hunk-had-a-familiar-face/","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa.

Invest in retail. Organize pastors. Tend to homeschoolers. Win the two big nods. Get outside of Des Moines.\nDespite Trump's unconventional campaign, and attacks from the billionaire that included questioning Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his being born in Canada, unaligned operatives until the last moments here remained certain that the core of Iowa caucus politics had not changed, despite Trump's unconventional campaign. \n\"Iowa has sent notice,\" Cruz said Monday night, \"that the Republican nominee of the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment, will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force, where all sovereignty resides in our nation, by we the people, the American people.\"\nCruz's team, basking in victory, projected more confidence than ever before that a strong showing in New Hampshire was within reach. Spokesman Rick Tyler pointed to Cruz's cash on hand, lapping the field by a considerable margin, and said it would put Cruz in a far better position than Marco Rubio and others in the Granite State -- even as they conceded Rubio now entered with momentum.\n\nIt was a victory set into motion two and a half years ago, when Cruz first touched down at the Des Moines Marriott -- only six months after he had been sworn into the Senate. \nCruz was known at the time for ideological purity -- not evangelical fervor -- but over the next few years, he would add to his Christian image, citing Scripture repeatedly in barns and convenience stores as he became more and more tailor-made for Iowa Republicans.\nOn that first trip here in August 2013, he met with a network of influential Iowa pastors, the same group he returned to last Monday, just a week before clergymen like them would help decide his fate. And he built his own network of evangelical pastors, recruiting one chief in each county and integrating them into a state leadership team that dwarfed other candidates' in size. \nFor much of 2015, Cruz visited Iowa consistently, but not overwhelmingly. He thumbed his nose at GOP rivals who essentially moved to the state in search of lightning strike. But he invested in face time, lingering late on a baseball diamond the day of the gay marriage decision in June and at a high-profile evangelical forum in November on one particularly long Iowa day.\nAnd he deliberately and conscientiously identified, courted and landed the two major conservative endorsements behind past Iowa winners, Rep. Steve King and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats, who together have been a road show for Cruz during his visits here over the past two months. \nTheir endorsements coincided with Cruz's first major surge in Iowa surveys, culminating with Cruz taking the lead in a Des Moines Register poll in mid-December. With King, he had a provocative spokesperson and a validator in the intense boxing match with the ethanol lobby. With Vander Plaats, he had a networker who could stick around to win over the weary (\"It's not that we dislike Santorum,\" he told one voter on the way out the door Saturday.)\n\nCruz, who had worked hard to tamper expectations, had inadvertently raised them.\n\"You see the poll?\" Jeff King, the congressman's son, who leads the Cruz super PAC operation here in Iowa, remembers saying to another group official then. \"We're going to have to do well in Iowa.\"\nCruz's wager on Iowa stood in contrast to his closest rivals: Trump and Rubio, both of whom are expected to do better in New Hampshire than the Texas senator.\n\"When he started this thing, he was nowhere,\" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz, standing on a chair as an overflow Cruz crowd surrounded him in Ames. \"I would use this campaign to teach others how to run a race.\" \nMonday morning, the Texan's campaign bus ambled to a basketball court in this Greene County town along the Raccoon River to pay heed to Iowa's most revered custom: the \"Full Grassley,\" or the pledge to visit all 99 counties, named for Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\"Whatever campaign techniques were used by the campaign that has won, maybe this was the year for that,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, the state's GOP chair. \"But I don't think retail politics, building a political machine and doing all 99 counties is every going to be out of date in this state.\"\nTrump spent a total of two nights in Iowa hotels, jetting in and out on a private plane for a rally every few days. Rubio blanketed the state in television ads, seeing campaign events as not as efficient a use of time as a Fox News hit or a super PAC media buy. Cruz aides stress that they layered a serious data and paid media campaign onto the infrastructure, but the bedrock of Cruz's bid here was a strategy that was more timeworn than innovative.\nVisiting every corner of Iowa doesn't guarantee anything, however. Mick Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who won the 2008 and 2012 GOP caucuses, respectively, barnstormed the state and came away at the bottom of the pack. Huckabee dropped out before the night was over.\n\"It will say as much about the process as it does about the outcome,\" said Joseph McReynolds, a Cruz fundraiser and activist, as he observed his candidate work a tiny town two days before voting.\nUp to the final hours in Iowa, Cruz's team maintained a sense of serenity, believing that the outcome's fate was largely out of their hands. Their voters would turn out. The big question that would decide the race was whether Trump's would -- and that was not in the Cruz campaign's control. \n\nThere was considerable worry among Cruz allies and donors that their candidate made the same mistake that bedeviled previous Iowa losers: that he peaked too early. \nCruz began a slow rise in Iowa polls in mid-October, but by the time he topped them in early January, he had invited the scorn of as many as seven outside groups, and nearly every candidate, including Trump, who was raising scornful questions about Cruz's eligibility to be president.\nIn addition to Trump's intense trolling and prodding in television interviews, Twitter and other free media, Cruz's campaign estimates that the senator was pummeled by $8 million in attack ads last month.\nAnd some allies and donors concede that those weeks -- rather than days -- on defense took its toll, including concerns pushed by the state's ethanol lobby, who led voters to badger Cruz at nearly every town hall in the homestretch of the Iowa campaign. Supporters differ on the number of points shaved by the ethanol offensive, but they admit it broke through.\nSome friends, in retrospect, say the campaign could have been more aggressive toward Trump and earlier. Yet most argue that avoiding Trump's scorn was the closest thing the campaign had to a masterstroke -- nearly every candidate who attacked Trump, of course, crashed.\nIt was a calculation they never thought they'd have to make. Cruz's win involved a fair amount of luck: Many of the candidates once likely to be top rivals here -- whether it was Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- fizzled entirely. When asked in June about the candidate competing with him most prominently in the evangelical lane, Cruz pointed to a candidate who ended up flirting with invisibility and dropped out Monday night: Mike Huckabee. \nIn the final moments, an old threat reappeared: Rubio. Trump had pulled away in some early polls, and Rubio began to inch up in some public polls. Cruz's super PACs, both weary Rubio's rise but also seeing his supporters as soft, began to target him aggressively. The campaign reassigned all of its advertising in the final days to hold off Rubio, once a vanquished opponent, instead.\nJohn Thompson, an unaligned Iowa GOP central committee member, said Cruz undoubtedly faded in the final weeks here. But the fundamentals of Cruz's bid, he said, charted a new Iowa path.\n\"He took the best out of every textbook that's ever been written,\" Thompson said, \"and I think he made a new game.\"","gunning_fog_4":"11.2","flesch_4":"11.1","readability_4":"56.59","index_5":"113","title_5":"BORDERLINE ACCURATE Trump camp defends using African migrants in 'wall' ad","url_5":"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/05/trump-criticized-for-campaign-ad-showing-southern-border-using-footage-morocco.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"Fox News","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s new television ad showing dozens of people swarming over a border fence is being criticized by a prominent fact-checker for using footage from a Spanish autonomous city that shares a border with Morocco. \nThe ad features a narrator who says of Trump, \"He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for,” as images show people streaming across a border fence. \nPolitiFact said the footage comes from the Italian television network RepubblicaTV, which posted video on May 3, 2015 of Moroccans crossing the border into the Spanish city of Melilla. \n\"Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over 'our southern border.'

Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}},{"id":1952870639,"created_at":"2016-04-08T00:26:55+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T00:15:13+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"instagc","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"MI","city":"Kalamazoo","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915112,"worker_id":25955589,"trust":0.75,"worker_trust":0.978125,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"1","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"0","q5":"0","q6":"0","q7":"0","q8":"0","q9":"0","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"might_not_vote"},"unit_data":{"nil":"6","index_1":"53","title_1":"Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented immigrants","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-deportation-guns-terrorism/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"(CNN) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN's Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump.\nCruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union\" that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S.\n \n\"No, I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,\" Cruz told Tapper as his campaign bus ambled across northern Iowa.\nTrump has promised to authorize a \"deportation force\" to remove those immigrants from the U.S., pledging to do it \"humanely.\" Trump has repeatedly charged that Cruz is merely copying his immigration positions, but Cruz has called his plan \"the most aggressive\" in the GOP field.\nEarlier this week, BuzzFeed captured Cruz on video arguing that his plan was stronger than Trump's because he would not allow those back into the U.S., while Trump's would.\nBut on the actual act of deportation, Cruz is taking a softer tact. \n\"We don't have any system that knocks on the doors of every person in America,\" Cruz told Tapper. \"We also don't have people going door-to-door looking for murderers. We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement.\"\nCruz indicated that he would only deport those who are apprehended, such as those who commit crimes or are caught by prospective employers without having immigrated legally. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement or Border Patrol agents could also apprehend those along the border.\nCruz's comments come at a time when President Barack Obama is coming under fire from some progressives for his administration's recent deportations of families back to unstable Central American countries. Some Democrats, including Reps. Linda Sanchez and Luis Gutierrez, argue that the families should be regarded as refugees, not immigrants.\nFor much of the campaign, Cruz has repeatedly declined to outline what he would do with the undocumented immigrants. But as his debate with Marco Rubio on immigration grew more heated, Cruz definitively ruled out a path to legal status and then has slowly offered more details about how he would deport those already here.\nCruz also said he did not believe those convicted of domestic abuse should be allowed to buy a firearm, and added that the White House's reluctance to use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\" -- a decision Cruz ties to political correctness -- has directly caused a loss of life.\n \nHe also rejected fears of a GOP electoral wipeout in November if he is the nominee, arguing that history makes clear that moderate Republicans have never fared well in presidential elections. \n\"Every time we do it we get clobbered,\" Cruz said. \"You know, this is no longer a theory. You know, as they say in the tech world, this has been beta-tested.\"","gunning_fog_1":"9.2","flesch_1":"9.1","readability_1":"61.67","index_2":"32","title_2":"Behind Ted Cruz’s Campaign Manager, Scorched Earth and Election Victories","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/us/politics/ted-cruz-campaign-manager-jeff-roe.html","candidate_2":"Ted Cruz","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"For weeks, the labels have hung over Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign like dirty laundry: Deceitful. Cynical. Willing to do anything to win.\n\nThe attacks from Mr. Cruz’s Republican rivals have challenged his core campaign promises of integrity and conservative purity, cresting on Monday when he dismissed his communications director, Rick Tyler, for spreading a misleading video about Marco Rubio’s views on the Bible.\n\n“There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom,” a Rubio spokesman said, “that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty.”\n\nThe episode threatened to tarnish Mr. Cruz’s brand. But not his campaign manager’s.\n\nAs Mr. Cruz has elbowed into the top tier of candidates, his campaign has conspicuously reflected the brand of its principal architect: Jeff Roe, an operative with a reputation for scorching earth, stretching truths and winning elections.\n\n“When you win campaigns,” Mr. Cruz said last month of the man he hired, “the people that lose tend to be unhappy about it.”\n\nMr. Roe’s home state, Missouri, teems with people who were made unhappy by him.\n\nAt 45, with lumbering swagger and drawling parables culled from the family farm, Mr. Roe has steered Mr. Cruz’s onetime long-shot presidential bid into contention.\n\nMr. Roe’s message has been consistent: Mr. Cruz is the most conservative candidate. His turnout operation is perhaps without peer. He all but guaranteed victory in Iowa, boasting to disbelieving reporters that they would be wasting their time to prepare articles on a Cruz loss.\n\nIt was Mr. Roe who hired Mr. Tyler to be the Texas senator’s campaign spokesman. (In an interview this month, Mr. Tyler said he had “learned a lot” from Mr. Roe. “Jeff wins,” Mr. Tyler said, adding, “I don’t think anything we’ve done is underhanded or deceptive or anything like that.”)\n\nBut back home, Mr. Roe’s allies and opponents alike have seen a familiar imprint in the Cruz campaign’s recent exploits, which have included a Photoshopped image of Mr. Rubio and the misleading suggestion, on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that Ben Carson was leaving the race.\n\nThere was the time, in 2006, when Mr. Roe ran an ad flashing “XXX” to highlight a 63-year-old, wheelchair-using congressional candidate’s former employer’s association with Penthouse magazine. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.\n\nLong before Mr. Cruz tweaked Mr. Trump’s “New York values,” Mr. Roe condemned the “San Francisco-style values” of another opponent in a 2008 ad featuring an ostentatiously dressed black man dancing with two women. Some criticized the spot as racist and homophobic. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.\n\nHe was among the first local operatives to tail opponents with camera-wielding trackers and, a decade ago, to investigate the social media pages of candidates and their children.\n\nHe has been known to quote Gandhi and ran a blog that trafficked in sometimes-sourced political gossip.\n\n“Jeff Roe does not know the difference between fact and fiction,” said Joe Brazil, a county councilman in Missouri who unsuccessfully sued Mr. Roe for defamation after a 2006 blog post days before Mr. Brazil’s primary in a State Senate race.\n\nThe item focused on a sad event from Mr. Brazil’s youth, when, at 17, he killed a classmate in a dump-truck accident. Mr. Roe’s post suggested Mr. Brazil had consumed “quite a few beers.” But Mr. Brazil had not been drinking, the police said, and was not charged.\n\nAfter watching coverage of the Iowa caucuses from his home in Augusta, Mo., Mr. Brazil said he tried to reach the Carson campaign, hoping to offer a history lesson.\n\n“How could they be surprised?” he asked.\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Roe’s clients and current colleagues vigorously defended his ethics. He has helped elect or re-elect 41 members of Congress, six senators and five governors. Surely, supporters say, hurt feelings are to be expected.\n\n“Jeff Roe likes to win,” said Representative Martha E. McSally of Arizona, who won her seat in 2014 by 167 votes.\n\n“Jeff is very intimidating, and he kind of likes that,” said Rod Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker.\n\n“Sometimes he makes people a little bit squeamish,” said Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, Mr. Roe’s mentor. “It is what it is.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s first experience with Mr. Roe came during his Senate run in Texas in 2012. Mr. Roe’s firm, working for Mr. Cruz’s opponent, produced a flier attacking Mr. Cruz’s legal work for a Chinese company. It made an impression, though Mr. Cruz won.\n\nMr. Roe, who declined to be interviewed, was quick to establish a distinctive culture at Mr. Cruz’s headquarters in Houston. Top aides were required to move there. (Mr. Roe brought along his wife, Missy, the 2010 winner of the Mrs. Missouri United States pageant; their baby, Remington, named in part for the gun maker; and Mrs. Roe’s parents.)\n\nMeetings begin when he sounds a siren on a bullhorn. They last 10 to 12 minutes, largely because the participants stand. And Roe family wisdom is often heard:\n\n“Get the corn down where the chickens can eat it.”\n\n“If you have a bunch of frogs to eat, eat the biggest one first.”\n\n“When it’s raining soup, put a bowl on your head.”\n\nThough Mr. Roe and Mr. Cruz share a conservative vision, there are differences between the candidate and his message maker.\n\nMr. Cruz is a practitioner of the filibuster; Mr. Roe is pithy and profane.\n\nMr. Cruz was an Ivy League debate champion; Mr. Roe worked on his family’s hog farm before joining the National Guard at 17, training with howitzers.\n\nMr. Cruz tracks his daily exercise habits on a Fitbit; Mr. Roe is built like a baseball umpire, which was once his dream job, and he chews Red Man Golden Blend tobacco, holstering a plastic soda bottle as a spittoon.\n\nMr. Roe started in politics in 1994, working on Mr. Graves’s election to the State Senate. But umpiring remained a passion. He practiced calling third strikes in the office, using a flourish he called “the chain saw.” He was once heckled at a high school game by the Hall of Famer Whitey Herzog, whose grandson was pitching.\n\nIn 1996, he was invited to major league umpiring school. He declined, reluctantly.\n\n“In the back of his mind, he still wonders, would I have made a great umpire?” Mr. Graves said.\n\nWhen Mr. Graves reached Congress, Mr. Roe became his chief of staff, occasionally earning the ire of the Bush White House. At one administration briefing for the Missouri delegation around 2002, Mr. Roe took issue with an agricultural proposal.\n\n“That’s just bad politics,” he said.\n\nA voice behind Mr. Roe objected. Mr. Roe pressed on, according to several people who recalled the scene, without bothering to face the man.\n\n“That’s just completely out of touch without the reality of Missouri politics,” he repeated.\n\nHe was talking to Karl Rove.\n\nIn 2005, Mr. Roe left Washington to start a political consulting firm in Missouri. His first presidential work was for Mike Huckabee in 2008; in 2012, he consulted for Rick Perry.\n\nBut as Mr. Roe prepared to manage his first presidential bid for Mr. Cruz last February, he faced new scrutiny at home. Days after he ran a radio ad mocking the physical appearance of Tom Schweich, a primary candidate for Missouri governor, by comparing him to Barney Fife, Mr. Schweich committed suicide.\n\nPeers said Mr. Schweich had faced many demons; he also thought the chairman of the state’s Republican Party had falsely spread word that he was Jewish. But some Missouri leaders viewed the ad as a last straw, casting Mr. Roe as the avatar of a toxic campaign culture.\n\n“Politics has gone so hideously wrong,” John C. Danforth, the state’s former three-term United States senator, said as he eulogized Mr. Schweich.\n\nMr. Roe has expressed condolences to Mr. Schweich’s family and horror at the death, but he betrayed little regret for the ad itself.\n\n“I live in the windshield,” he told The New Republic. “I don’t live in the rearview mirror.”\n\nSuch has been his response through the years, more or less, to questions of whether his tactics were fair or foul.\n\nStill, colleagues and even opponents have said Mr. Roe is capable of introspection, of inspiring loyalty and, among competitors, of engendering respect.\n\nMr. Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker, said he had long since lost touch with Mr. Roe, a friend-turned-adversary, when Mr. Jetton was arrested and charged with assault in 2009, eventually pleading guilty and being placed on probation; in 2010, he faced a grand jury investigation over questions of bribery, though he was not indicted.\n\nOut of the blue, Mr. Jetton received a text from Mr. Roe. “He said, ‘Hey, politics is one thing, but this kind of stuff, you don’t wish for anybody,’ ” Mr. Jetton recalled. “I don’t know that I would have done that for him.”","gunning_fog_2":"6.4","flesch_2":"5.2","readability_2":"77.23","index_3":"36","title_3":"First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: The Tattooed Hunk Had a Familiar Face","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/09/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-the-tattooed-hunk-had-a-familiar-face/","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa.

Invest in retail. Organize pastors. Tend to homeschoolers. Win the two big nods. Get outside of Des Moines.\nDespite Trump's unconventional campaign, and attacks from the billionaire that included questioning Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his being born in Canada, unaligned operatives until the last moments here remained certain that the core of Iowa caucus politics had not changed, despite Trump's unconventional campaign. \n\"Iowa has sent notice,\" Cruz said Monday night, \"that the Republican nominee of the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment, will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force, where all sovereignty resides in our nation, by we the people, the American people.\"\nCruz's team, basking in victory, projected more confidence than ever before that a strong showing in New Hampshire was within reach. Spokesman Rick Tyler pointed to Cruz's cash on hand, lapping the field by a considerable margin, and said it would put Cruz in a far better position than Marco Rubio and others in the Granite State -- even as they conceded Rubio now entered with momentum.\n\nIt was a victory set into motion two and a half years ago, when Cruz first touched down at the Des Moines Marriott -- only six months after he had been sworn into the Senate. \nCruz was known at the time for ideological purity -- not evangelical fervor -- but over the next few years, he would add to his Christian image, citing Scripture repeatedly in barns and convenience stores as he became more and more tailor-made for Iowa Republicans.\nOn that first trip here in August 2013, he met with a network of influential Iowa pastors, the same group he returned to last Monday, just a week before clergymen like them would help decide his fate. And he built his own network of evangelical pastors, recruiting one chief in each county and integrating them into a state leadership team that dwarfed other candidates' in size. \nFor much of 2015, Cruz visited Iowa consistently, but not overwhelmingly. He thumbed his nose at GOP rivals who essentially moved to the state in search of lightning strike. But he invested in face time, lingering late on a baseball diamond the day of the gay marriage decision in June and at a high-profile evangelical forum in November on one particularly long Iowa day.\nAnd he deliberately and conscientiously identified, courted and landed the two major conservative endorsements behind past Iowa winners, Rep. Steve King and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats, who together have been a road show for Cruz during his visits here over the past two months. \nTheir endorsements coincided with Cruz's first major surge in Iowa surveys, culminating with Cruz taking the lead in a Des Moines Register poll in mid-December. With King, he had a provocative spokesperson and a validator in the intense boxing match with the ethanol lobby. With Vander Plaats, he had a networker who could stick around to win over the weary (\"It's not that we dislike Santorum,\" he told one voter on the way out the door Saturday.)\n\nCruz, who had worked hard to tamper expectations, had inadvertently raised them.\n\"You see the poll?\" Jeff King, the congressman's son, who leads the Cruz super PAC operation here in Iowa, remembers saying to another group official then. \"We're going to have to do well in Iowa.\"\nCruz's wager on Iowa stood in contrast to his closest rivals: Trump and Rubio, both of whom are expected to do better in New Hampshire than the Texas senator.\n\"When he started this thing, he was nowhere,\" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz, standing on a chair as an overflow Cruz crowd surrounded him in Ames. \"I would use this campaign to teach others how to run a race.\" \nMonday morning, the Texan's campaign bus ambled to a basketball court in this Greene County town along the Raccoon River to pay heed to Iowa's most revered custom: the \"Full Grassley,\" or the pledge to visit all 99 counties, named for Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\"Whatever campaign techniques were used by the campaign that has won, maybe this was the year for that,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, the state's GOP chair. \"But I don't think retail politics, building a political machine and doing all 99 counties is every going to be out of date in this state.\"\nTrump spent a total of two nights in Iowa hotels, jetting in and out on a private plane for a rally every few days. Rubio blanketed the state in television ads, seeing campaign events as not as efficient a use of time as a Fox News hit or a super PAC media buy. Cruz aides stress that they layered a serious data and paid media campaign onto the infrastructure, but the bedrock of Cruz's bid here was a strategy that was more timeworn than innovative.\nVisiting every corner of Iowa doesn't guarantee anything, however. Mick Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who won the 2008 and 2012 GOP caucuses, respectively, barnstormed the state and came away at the bottom of the pack. Huckabee dropped out before the night was over.\n\"It will say as much about the process as it does about the outcome,\" said Joseph McReynolds, a Cruz fundraiser and activist, as he observed his candidate work a tiny town two days before voting.\nUp to the final hours in Iowa, Cruz's team maintained a sense of serenity, believing that the outcome's fate was largely out of their hands. Their voters would turn out. The big question that would decide the race was whether Trump's would -- and that was not in the Cruz campaign's control. \n\nThere was considerable worry among Cruz allies and donors that their candidate made the same mistake that bedeviled previous Iowa losers: that he peaked too early. \nCruz began a slow rise in Iowa polls in mid-October, but by the time he topped them in early January, he had invited the scorn of as many as seven outside groups, and nearly every candidate, including Trump, who was raising scornful questions about Cruz's eligibility to be president.\nIn addition to Trump's intense trolling and prodding in television interviews, Twitter and other free media, Cruz's campaign estimates that the senator was pummeled by $8 million in attack ads last month.\nAnd some allies and donors concede that those weeks -- rather than days -- on defense took its toll, including concerns pushed by the state's ethanol lobby, who led voters to badger Cruz at nearly every town hall in the homestretch of the Iowa campaign. Supporters differ on the number of points shaved by the ethanol offensive, but they admit it broke through.\nSome friends, in retrospect, say the campaign could have been more aggressive toward Trump and earlier. Yet most argue that avoiding Trump's scorn was the closest thing the campaign had to a masterstroke -- nearly every candidate who attacked Trump, of course, crashed.\nIt was a calculation they never thought they'd have to make. Cruz's win involved a fair amount of luck: Many of the candidates once likely to be top rivals here -- whether it was Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- fizzled entirely. When asked in June about the candidate competing with him most prominently in the evangelical lane, Cruz pointed to a candidate who ended up flirting with invisibility and dropped out Monday night: Mike Huckabee. \nIn the final moments, an old threat reappeared: Rubio. Trump had pulled away in some early polls, and Rubio began to inch up in some public polls.

Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}},{"id":1952886496,"created_at":"2016-04-08T01:02:17+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T00:57:41+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"clixsense","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"Los Angeles","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915112,"worker_id":18053528,"trust":0.666666666666667,"worker_trust":0.933191858342461,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"-1","q2":"0","q3":"0","q4":"0","q5":"0","q6":"0","q7":"1","q8":"0","q9":"1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"no_affiliation","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"other"},"unit_data":{"nil":"6","index_1":"53","title_1":"Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented immigrants","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-deportation-guns-terrorism/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"(CNN) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN's Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump.\nCruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union\" that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S.\n \n\"No, I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,\" Cruz told Tapper as his campaign bus ambled across northern Iowa.\nTrump has promised to authorize a \"deportation force\" to remove those immigrants from the U.S., pledging to do it \"humanely.\" Trump has repeatedly charged that Cruz is merely copying his immigration positions, but Cruz has called his plan \"the most aggressive\" in the GOP field.\nEarlier this week, BuzzFeed captured Cruz on video arguing that his plan was stronger than Trump's because he would not allow those back into the U.S., while Trump's would.\nBut on the actual act of deportation, Cruz is taking a softer tact. \n\"We don't have any system that knocks on the doors of every person in America,\" Cruz told Tapper. \"We also don't have people going door-to-door looking for murderers. We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement.\"\nCruz indicated that he would only deport those who are apprehended, such as those who commit crimes or are caught by prospective employers without having immigrated legally. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement or Border Patrol agents could also apprehend those along the border.\nCruz's comments come at a time when President Barack Obama is coming under fire from some progressives for his administration's recent deportations of families back to unstable Central American countries. Some Democrats, including Reps. Linda Sanchez and Luis Gutierrez, argue that the families should be regarded as refugees, not immigrants.\nFor much of the campaign, Cruz has repeatedly declined to outline what he would do with the undocumented immigrants. But as his debate with Marco Rubio on immigration grew more heated, Cruz definitively ruled out a path to legal status and then has slowly offered more details about how he would deport those already here.\nCruz also said he did not believe those convicted of domestic abuse should be allowed to buy a firearm, and added that the White House's reluctance to use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\" -- a decision Cruz ties to political correctness -- has directly caused a loss of life.\n \nHe also rejected fears of a GOP electoral wipeout in November if he is the nominee, arguing that history makes clear that moderate Republicans have never fared well in presidential elections. \n\"Every time we do it we get clobbered,\" Cruz said. \"You know, this is no longer a theory. You know, as they say in the tech world, this has been beta-tested.\"","gunning_fog_1":"9.2","flesch_1":"9.1","readability_1":"61.67","index_2":"32","title_2":"Behind Ted Cruz’s Campaign Manager, Scorched Earth and Election Victories","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/us/politics/ted-cruz-campaign-manager-jeff-roe.html","candidate_2":"Ted Cruz","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"For weeks, the labels have hung over Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign like dirty laundry: Deceitful. Cynical. Willing to do anything to win.\n\nThe attacks from Mr. Cruz’s Republican rivals have challenged his core campaign promises of integrity and conservative purity, cresting on Monday when he dismissed his communications director, Rick Tyler, for spreading a misleading video about Marco Rubio’s views on the Bible.\n\n“There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom,” a Rubio spokesman said, “that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty.”\n\nThe episode threatened to tarnish Mr. Cruz’s brand. But not his campaign manager’s.\n\nAs Mr. Cruz has elbowed into the top tier of candidates, his campaign has conspicuously reflected the brand of its principal architect: Jeff Roe, an operative with a reputation for scorching earth, stretching truths and winning elections.\n\n“When you win campaigns,” Mr. Cruz said last month of the man he hired, “the people that lose tend to be unhappy about it.”\n\nMr. Roe’s home state, Missouri, teems with people who were made unhappy by him.\n\nAt 45, with lumbering swagger and drawling parables culled from the family farm, Mr. Roe has steered Mr. Cruz’s onetime long-shot presidential bid into contention.\n\nMr. Roe’s message has been consistent: Mr. Cruz is the most conservative candidate. His turnout operation is perhaps without peer. He all but guaranteed victory in Iowa, boasting to disbelieving reporters that they would be wasting their time to prepare articles on a Cruz loss.\n\nIt was Mr. Roe who hired Mr. Tyler to be the Texas senator’s campaign spokesman. (In an interview this month, Mr. Tyler said he had “learned a lot” from Mr. Roe. “Jeff wins,” Mr. Tyler said, adding, “I don’t think anything we’ve done is underhanded or deceptive or anything like that.”)\n\nBut back home, Mr. Roe’s allies and opponents alike have seen a familiar imprint in the Cruz campaign’s recent exploits, which have included a Photoshopped image of Mr. Rubio and the misleading suggestion, on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that Ben Carson was leaving the race.\n\nThere was the time, in 2006, when Mr. Roe ran an ad flashing “XXX” to highlight a 63-year-old, wheelchair-using congressional candidate’s former employer’s association with Penthouse magazine. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.\n\nLong before Mr. Cruz tweaked Mr. Trump’s “New York values,” Mr. Roe condemned the “San Francisco-style values” of another opponent in a 2008 ad featuring an ostentatiously dressed black man dancing with two women. Some criticized the spot as racist and homophobic. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.\n\nHe was among the first local operatives to tail opponents with camera-wielding trackers and, a decade ago, to investigate the social media pages of candidates and their children.\n\nHe has been known to quote Gandhi and ran a blog that trafficked in sometimes-sourced political gossip.\n\n“Jeff Roe does not know the difference between fact and fiction,” said Joe Brazil, a county councilman in Missouri who unsuccessfully sued Mr. Roe for defamation after a 2006 blog post days before Mr. Brazil’s primary in a State Senate race.\n\nThe item focused on a sad event from Mr. Brazil’s youth, when, at 17, he killed a classmate in a dump-truck accident. Mr. Roe’s post suggested Mr. Brazil had consumed “quite a few beers.” But Mr. Brazil had not been drinking, the police said, and was not charged.\n\nAfter watching coverage of the Iowa caucuses from his home in Augusta, Mo., Mr. Brazil said he tried to reach the Carson campaign, hoping to offer a history lesson.\n\n“How could they be surprised?” he asked.\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Roe’s clients and current colleagues vigorously defended his ethics. He has helped elect or re-elect 41 members of Congress, six senators and five governors. Surely, supporters say, hurt feelings are to be expected.\n\n“Jeff Roe likes to win,” said Representative Martha E. McSally of Arizona, who won her seat in 2014 by 167 votes.\n\n“Jeff is very intimidating, and he kind of likes that,” said Rod Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker.\n\n“Sometimes he makes people a little bit squeamish,” said Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, Mr. Roe’s mentor. “It is what it is.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s first experience with Mr. Roe came during his Senate run in Texas in 2012. Mr. Roe’s firm, working for Mr. Cruz’s opponent, produced a flier attacking Mr. Cruz’s legal work for a Chinese company. It made an impression, though Mr. Cruz won.\n\nMr. Roe, who declined to be interviewed, was quick to establish a distinctive culture at Mr. Cruz’s headquarters in Houston. Top aides were required to move there. (Mr. Roe brought along his wife, Missy, the 2010 winner of the Mrs. Missouri United States pageant; their baby, Remington, named in part for the gun maker; and Mrs. Roe’s parents.)\n\nMeetings begin when he sounds a siren on a bullhorn. They last 10 to 12 minutes, largely because the participants stand. And Roe family wisdom is often heard:\n\n“Get the corn down where the chickens can eat it.”\n\n“If you have a bunch of frogs to eat, eat the biggest one first.”\n\n“When it’s raining soup, put a bowl on your head.”\n\nThough Mr. Roe and Mr. Cruz share a conservative vision, there are differences between the candidate and his message maker.\n\nMr. Cruz is a practitioner of the filibuster; Mr. Roe is pithy and profane.\n\nMr. Cruz was an Ivy League debate champion; Mr. Roe worked on his family’s hog farm before joining the National Guard at 17, training with howitzers.\n\nMr. Cruz tracks his daily exercise habits on a Fitbit; Mr. Roe is built like a baseball umpire, which was once his dream job, and he chews Red Man Golden Blend tobacco, holstering a plastic soda bottle as a spittoon.\n\nMr. Roe started in politics in 1994, working on Mr. Graves’s election to the State Senate. But umpiring remained a passion. He practiced calling third strikes in the office, using a flourish he called “the chain saw.” He was once heckled at a high school game by the Hall of Famer Whitey Herzog, whose grandson was pitching.\n\nIn 1996, he was invited to major league umpiring school. He declined, reluctantly.\n\n“In the back of his mind, he still wonders, would I have made a great umpire?” Mr. Graves said.\n\nWhen Mr. Graves reached Congress, Mr. Roe became his chief of staff, occasionally earning the ire of the Bush White House. At one administration briefing for the Missouri delegation around 2002, Mr. Roe took issue with an agricultural proposal.\n\n“That’s just bad politics,” he said.\n\nA voice behind Mr. Roe objected. Mr. Roe pressed on, according to several people who recalled the scene, without bothering to face the man.\n\n“That’s just completely out of touch without the reality of Missouri politics,” he repeated.\n\nHe was talking to Karl Rove.\n\nIn 2005, Mr. Roe left Washington to start a political consulting firm in Missouri. His first presidential work was for Mike Huckabee in 2008; in 2012, he consulted for Rick Perry.\n\nBut as Mr. Roe prepared to manage his first presidential bid for Mr. Cruz last February, he faced new scrutiny at home. Days after he ran a radio ad mocking the physical appearance of Tom Schweich, a primary candidate for Missouri governor, by comparing him to Barney Fife, Mr. Schweich committed suicide.\n\nPeers said Mr. Schweich had faced many demons; he also thought the chairman of the state’s Republican Party had falsely spread word that he was Jewish. But some Missouri leaders viewed the ad as a last straw, casting Mr. Roe as the avatar of a toxic campaign culture.\n\n“Politics has gone so hideously wrong,” John C. Danforth, the state’s former three-term United States senator, said as he eulogized Mr. Schweich.\n\nMr. Roe has expressed condolences to Mr. Schweich’s family and horror at the death, but he betrayed little regret for the ad itself.\n\n“I live in the windshield,” he told The New Republic. “I don’t live in the rearview mirror.”\n\nSuch has been his response through the years, more or less, to questions of whether his tactics were fair or foul.\n\nStill, colleagues and even opponents have said Mr. Roe is capable of introspection, of inspiring loyalty and, among competitors, of engendering respect.\n\nMr. Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker, said he had long since lost touch with Mr. Roe, a friend-turned-adversary, when Mr. Jetton was arrested and charged with assault in 2009, eventually pleading guilty and being placed on probation; in 2010, he faced a grand jury investigation over questions of bribery, though he was not indicted.\n\nOut of the blue, Mr. Jetton received a text from Mr. Roe. “He said, ‘Hey, politics is one thing, but this kind of stuff, you don’t wish for anybody,’ ” Mr. Jetton recalled. “I don’t know that I would have done that for him.”","gunning_fog_2":"6.4","flesch_2":"5.2","readability_2":"77.23","index_3":"36","title_3":"First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: The Tattooed Hunk Had a Familiar Face","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/09/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-the-tattooed-hunk-had-a-familiar-face/","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa.

Invest in retail. Organize pastors. Tend to homeschoolers. Win the two big nods. Get outside of Des Moines.\nDespite Trump's unconventional campaign, and attacks from the billionaire that included questioning Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his being born in Canada, unaligned operatives until the last moments here remained certain that the core of Iowa caucus politics had not changed, despite Trump's unconventional campaign. \n\"Iowa has sent notice,\" Cruz said Monday night, \"that the Republican nominee of the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment, will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force, where all sovereignty resides in our nation, by we the people, the American people.\"\nCruz's team, basking in victory, projected more confidence than ever before that a strong showing in New Hampshire was within reach. Spokesman Rick Tyler pointed to Cruz's cash on hand, lapping the field by a considerable margin, and said it would put Cruz in a far better position than Marco Rubio and others in the Granite State -- even as they conceded Rubio now entered with momentum.\n\nIt was a victory set into motion two and a half years ago, when Cruz first touched down at the Des Moines Marriott -- only six months after he had been sworn into the Senate. \nCruz was known at the time for ideological purity -- not evangelical fervor -- but over the next few years, he would add to his Christian image, citing Scripture repeatedly in barns and convenience stores as he became more and more tailor-made for Iowa Republicans.\nOn that first trip here in August 2013, he met with a network of influential Iowa pastors, the same group he returned to last Monday, just a week before clergymen like them would help decide his fate. And he built his own network of evangelical pastors, recruiting one chief in each county and integrating them into a state leadership team that dwarfed other candidates' in size. \nFor much of 2015, Cruz visited Iowa consistently, but not overwhelmingly. He thumbed his nose at GOP rivals who essentially moved to the state in search of lightning strike. But he invested in face time, lingering late on a baseball diamond the day of the gay marriage decision in June and at a high-profile evangelical forum in November on one particularly long Iowa day.\nAnd he deliberately and conscientiously identified, courted and landed the two major conservative endorsements behind past Iowa winners, Rep. Steve King and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats, who together have been a road show for Cruz during his visits here over the past two months. \nTheir endorsements coincided with Cruz's first major surge in Iowa surveys, culminating with Cruz taking the lead in a Des Moines Register poll in mid-December. With King, he had a provocative spokesperson and a validator in the intense boxing match with the ethanol lobby. With Vander Plaats, he had a networker who could stick around to win over the weary (\"It's not that we dislike Santorum,\" he told one voter on the way out the door Saturday.)\n\nCruz, who had worked hard to tamper expectations, had inadvertently raised them.\n\"You see the poll?\" Jeff King, the congressman's son, who leads the Cruz super PAC operation here in Iowa, remembers saying to another group official then. \"We're going to have to do well in Iowa.\"\nCruz's wager on Iowa stood in contrast to his closest rivals: Trump and Rubio, both of whom are expected to do better in New Hampshire than the Texas senator.\n\"When he started this thing, he was nowhere,\" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz, standing on a chair as an overflow Cruz crowd surrounded him in Ames. \"I would use this campaign to teach others how to run a race.\" \nMonday morning, the Texan's campaign bus ambled to a basketball court in this Greene County town along the Raccoon River to pay heed to Iowa's most revered custom: the \"Full Grassley,\" or the pledge to visit all 99 counties, named for Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\"Whatever campaign techniques were used by the campaign that has won, maybe this was the year for that,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, the state's GOP chair. \"But I don't think retail politics, building a political machine and doing all 99 counties is every going to be out of date in this state.\"\nTrump spent a total of two nights in Iowa hotels, jetting in and out on a private plane for a rally every few days. Rubio blanketed the state in television ads, seeing campaign events as not as efficient a use of time as a Fox News hit or a super PAC media buy. Cruz aides stress that they layered a serious data and paid media campaign onto the infrastructure, but the bedrock of Cruz's bid here was a strategy that was more timeworn than innovative.\nVisiting every corner of Iowa doesn't guarantee anything, however. Mick Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who won the 2008 and 2012 GOP caucuses, respectively, barnstormed the state and came away at the bottom of the pack. Huckabee dropped out before the night was over.\n\"It will say as much about the process as it does about the outcome,\" said Joseph McReynolds, a Cruz fundraiser and activist, as he observed his candidate work a tiny town two days before voting.\nUp to the final hours in Iowa, Cruz's team maintained a sense of serenity, believing that the outcome's fate was largely out of their hands. Their voters would turn out. The big question that would decide the race was whether Trump's would -- and that was not in the Cruz campaign's control. \n\nThere was considerable worry among Cruz allies and donors that their candidate made the same mistake that bedeviled previous Iowa losers: that he peaked too early. \nCruz began a slow rise in Iowa polls in mid-October, but by the time he topped them in early January, he had invited the scorn of as many as seven outside groups, and nearly every candidate, including Trump, who was raising scornful questions about Cruz's eligibility to be president.\nIn addition to Trump's intense trolling and prodding in television interviews, Twitter and other free media, Cruz's campaign estimates that the senator was pummeled by $8 million in attack ads last month.\nAnd some allies and donors concede that those weeks -- rather than days -- on defense took its toll, including concerns pushed by the state's ethanol lobby, who led voters to badger Cruz at nearly every town hall in the homestretch of the Iowa campaign. Supporters differ on the number of points shaved by the ethanol offensive, but they admit it broke through.\nSome friends, in retrospect, say the campaign could have been more aggressive toward Trump and earlier. Yet most argue that avoiding Trump's scorn was the closest thing the campaign had to a masterstroke -- nearly every candidate who attacked Trump, of course, crashed.\nIt was a calculation they never thought they'd have to make. Cruz's win involved a fair amount of luck: Many of the candidates once likely to be top rivals here -- whether it was Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- fizzled entirely. When asked in June about the candidate competing with him most prominently in the evangelical lane, Cruz pointed to a candidate who ended up flirting with invisibility and dropped out Monday night: Mike Huckabee. \nIn the final moments, an old threat reappeared: Rubio. Trump had pulled away in some early polls, and Rubio began to inch up in some public polls.

Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5862068965517242},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7241379310344827},"q1":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.6896551724137931},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7241379310344827},"q3":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q4":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5862068965517242},"q5":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q6":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q7":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6896551724137931},"q8":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q9":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6896551724137931},"q10":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5862068965517242},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"female","confidence":0.7241379310344827},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"3049","confidence":0.5862068965517242},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":0.7241379310344827},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"other","confidence":0.6896551724137931}}}

Ted Cruz’s attack on “ New York values” has attracted the ire of a prominent New Yorker: Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nIn three TV interviews on Friday, the morning after the most recent GOP presidential debate, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, excoriated Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, for his comments the previous evening.\n“We’re not judgmental, negative and hostile, the way Cruz was,” Mr. Cuomo told NY1. “In one, 30-second sound-bite, he was offensive to gays, he was offensive to women, he offended 18 million New Yorkers — one of the largest Congressional delegations, by the way, in the country.”\nA Cruz spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Cruz has criticized Donald Trump for embodying  “New York values.” During the debate, he was asked about what he meant by that. He said: “Everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.”\n“I guess I can frame it another way,” he added: “Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying.”\nMr. Trump responded by noting conservative giant William F. Buckley was a New Yorker and cited the resilience of New Yorkers following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nIn the NY1 interview, Mr. Cuomo, along with describing Mr. Cruz’s remarks as designed to “spread fear,” said they were inaccurate: “We have a significant conservative party and movement in New York. About 30% of New Yorkers will tell you they are conservatives. Trust me,” he said, “I deal with them every day.”\nMr. Cuomo also pegged Mr. Cruz as a hypocrite for having fundraised in New York, which the senator has done on numerous occasions. “I’m sure Ted Cruz was very negative about New York money,” the governor said, mockingly. “I’m sure he’s not going to accept any money from any New Yorker. I’m sure if he has, he’s going to return all of those contributions.”\nAdded Mr. Cuomo: “I’m always open to give him an education on what New York values are all about. And if he had any class, he would apologize to the people of New York — not that I believe they need it, or they want it. But if he had any class, he would apologize.”\nAside from NY1, Mr. Cuomo also appeared on MSNBC and CNN.\nThe governor wasn’t the only New York official to pounce on Mr. Cruz. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that he was “disgusted” by the senator’s remarks.\nSaid Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat: “I find myself, for once, in agreement with Donald Trump. I think it was right for Donald Trump to defend New York City, and to talk about the heroic actions of the people of this city after 9/11.”","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"7","title_2":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Tells Minnesotans They Can ‘Make History’","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-tells-minnesotans-they-can-make-history/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"MINNEAPOLIS — On the eve of voting in 11 Democratic contests, Bernie Sanders told hundreds of supporters here on Monday that he was counting on them to defeat Hillary Clinton and start a political revolution.\n\nMr. Sanders, eager to bounce back from back-to-back losses in Nevada and South Carolina, cast the primaries and caucuses on Tuesday as a chance to “make history” and show that the coalition of young and working-class people he hopes to bring together can help him win the Democratic presidential nomination. The senator also criticized Mrs. Clinton on several fronts: her praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, her ties to Wall Street and her stances on trade policies.\n\n“The truth is, tomorrow is important and key,” Mr. Sanders said, adding, as usual, that a high voter turnout would benefit him. “We can win, no question, here in Minnesota — if we have the turnout.”\n\nMr. Sanders also said it was important that voters understood the differences between him and Mrs. Clinton. He stressed that he did not have a “super PAC” as she does and that Mrs. Clinton supported several trade policies that he believes led to millions of people losing their jobs. He also chastised her admiration for Mr. Kissinger.\n\n“She looked to Henry Kissinger as one of her mentors,” Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd booed. “I will not look to Henry Kissinger for guidance. In fact, Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.”\n\nMr. Sanders, delivering a stump speech for about 40 minutes, also said that if elected he would change campaign finance laws, devote resources to fighting climate change and work on combating institutional racism. He added that he would push back against laws that in his view suppress voter rights. And he pledged to increase wages and give people access to tuition-free public colleges and universities.\n\nThe senator also talked about providing more resources to American Indians. “We owe Native Americans so, so much,” Mr. Sanders said. “We cannot continue current policies which are so devastating to the Native-American community. That will change under a Sanders administration.”\n\nHis address came after his campaign announced that the senator had raised $36 million  from 1.2 million individual donors in February. The campaign added that they hoped to raise $40 million by the end of Monday — meaning that they are aiming to bring in $4 million in one day.\n\nMr. Sanders also planned to hold a rally in Milton, Mass., on Monday night, the same state where Hillary Clinton campaigned on Monday.","gunning_fog_2":"8.0","flesch_2":"8.0","readability_2":"64.71","index_3":"39","title_3":"First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: Ethanol Subsidies and Shark Jumping","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/05/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-ethanol-subsidies-and-shark-jumping/","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa.

Now, it's being read as an omen of what's to come in 10 days' time when Southern states vote on Super Tuesday.\nCruz once called the God-fearing, gun-toting SEC states that vote then on March 1 his \"firewall,\" but polls show Trump leading in South Carolina, and a dominant performance Saturday would show that Cruz has not been able to sufficiently consolidate the evangelical base that he needs to win down the road in places like Tennessee and Georgia.\nThe recent CNN Poll of Polls shows Trump with an average lead of 16 percentage points over Cruz, though a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey on Friday showed Cruz only 5 points back.\nSeveral people close to the campaign concede that losing South Carolina by double digits would spell serious trouble for Super Tuesday. If it's a tighter loss, some say, it would validate the theory that Trump was susceptible to their attacks and encourage more.\n\"Everybody is watching: Can support be stripped from Donald Trump?\" one pro-Cruz fundraiser asked, predicting that if Trump only earns between 25% and 30%, it will \"unleash\" a new wave of anti-Trump money. \"Then people will realize Trump can be beaten in a lot of the March 1 states.\" \n\"But if Trump gets 38 or 40 -- and Cruz is second with 22 or something like that -- it's going to be very ominous,\" the fundraiser added.\nAll week, Cruz has campaigned with the same urgency seen in the lead-up to Iowa, gleefully drawing sharp contrasts with Trump and Rubio alike. He has rolled out his best endorsements, including one from Rep. Mark Sanford on Friday. And he has showed an awareness of the high stakes on Saturday for his campaign, where the narrative could begin to swing against him in the South.\n\"Twenty-one hours. That's how long we've got until the polls close,\" Cruz said in Myrtle Beach. \"These next 21 hours are going to decide a great deal.\"\n\nCruz allies are doing everything they can to separate their candidate's fortunes in South Carolina from those elsewhere in the South. \nThe campaign points to a national NBC/Wall Street Journal survey this week that showed Cruz leading Trump by 2 points, although other national polls still have the New York businessman easily in the lead. They also maintain that Trump's position on abortion and his recent comments about the presidency of George W. Bush will doom him in the South. \n\"It's a little tough to do an exact extrapolation between what happened in South Carolina and on March 1,\" said Jason Miller, a senior Cruz adviser, who stressed that Cruz has already proven in Iowa that it can turn out his voters. \"These are states that Ted Cruz matches up well in.\" \nCruz surrogate Jack Kingston, a former congressman from just over the border in Georgia, went so far as to tell reporters Thursday that Cruz \"shouldn't even be viable\" in South Carolina, quite the departure from a state that Cruz's team once saw as winnable. \nGlenn Beck: God took Scalia to give America Ted Cruz as president\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of March 1 to Cruz's self-professed path to victory -- he has made the date, which will award more delegates than any other day in the Republican calendar, the cornerstone of his strategy. \nAllies tell CNN Cruz is hoping to win 60% of the delegates there. He scrapped time in Iowa to take two barnstorming bus tours of the south. He's called his operation three to five times better than the rest of the field's. And the core of Cruz's SEC stronghold, his home state of Texas, is still unlikely to be pierced.\n\nThe Cruz campaign appears as occupied with Marco Rubio leapfrogging them into third place as it is with catching Trump for first. It releases anti-Rubio attack ads at a daily rate and has jumped squarely into a messy, seemingly endless argument with Rubio's over Facebook pages and Photoshopped images.\nMiller and Cruz aides are trying to hoist Rubio's expectations as high as possible: Given Rubio's endorsements here, including Gov. Nikki Haley, Cruz's team argues Rubio needs to outright win the state in order to meet them.\nAs for Trump, the plan is simple: attack.\nWith the race shifting to a national campaign defined more by expensive television ads than retail politics, some Cruz supporters have faith that South Carolina will show that negative ads like those Cruz forces have aired against Trump will work. After largely skating free in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump is finally being attacked by a battery of super PACs. \nCruz's campaign is hitting Trump on those issues, airing ads featuring Trump's 1999 interview with the late Tim Russert in which he declares he is \"pro-choice.\" (Trump maintains his position has changed and sent Cruz a cease-and-desist letter, which Cruz laughed off.) \nTed Cruz to Donald Trump: Sue me\nAssuming Cruz does hold off Rubio, though, the key will be how large the margin of loss is to Trump, who also holds a large lead in Nevada. \n\"If Trump wins and we're second, the SEC primary becomes a 50/50 scenario,\" said one Cruz insider. \"It's our territory, but he'll have the momentum.\" \nIn the meantime, Cruz is trying his best to look ahead. When a foreign-born woman who now lives in Georgia crossed the Carolina border to see Cruz in Greenville on Thursday, Cruz was as eager to get her to the ballot box as she was herself. \n\"The reason I became an American citizen is so I can vote for people like you,\" Hannah Kanner, born in communist Czechoslovakia, told him. \"I'm from Georgia -- sorry! I wish I could vote on Saturday, but I can't.\" \n\"On March 1,\" Cruz replied, \"you can.\"","gunning_fog_4":"10.4","flesch_4":"9.1","readability_4":"67.08","index_5":"112","title_5":"Donald Trump just plain wrong on torture (opinion)","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/opinions/trump-torture-bergenas/index.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_5":"Johan Bergenas is a senior associate at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, a nonprofit institution devoted to enhancing international peace and security through analysis and outreach. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.\n (CNN) Donald Trump says that \"torture works\" and that if elected president, he will bring back waterboarding.\nIn fact, he says he will allow techniques \"a hell of a lot worse\" than waterboarding and use them regardless of effectiveness on terrorist organizations like ISIS because they \"deserve it.\" \nBy advocating that the United States brings back torture, Trump again demonstrates his astute understanding of the American electorate. Fifty-three percent of Americans say that torturing terrorists can be justified. Polling only Republicans, the slice of the electorate Trump is trying to charm in this primary season, the number is even larger, over 70%.\nOne reason behind these large numbers can be gathered from psychological studies in which individuals support the use of torture when the subject is categorized as a terrorist, regardless of its intelligence value.\nIt may be smart politics to support torture, but Trump's eye-for-an-eye approach to defeat terrorist networks will make the United States less, not more, safe and the American electorate needs to know why, before more ballots are cast.\nIn fact, today most government officials, regardless of party affiliation, experts and scientists agree with Republican Sen. John McCain that torture \"compromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good.\"\nImportantly, there is also widespread agreement that American use of torture serves as a recruitment magnet for the world's terrorist networks. Several high ranking government officials note how al Qaeda use Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay as symbolic recruiting tools to reinforce anti-American sentiment and grow their numbers.\nIn short, Trump's torture policy will fuel the same terrorist organizations that he wants to destroy.\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order banning waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques -- the methods Trump says he would reinstall if elected. Instead Obama favors methods that glean intelligence without sacrificing America's ideals, such as a rapport-building approach that is far more likely to elicit good and earlier intelligence than torture. \nWhen issuing the executive order, the President said that enhanced interrogation methods \"serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists and they increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. ... They did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them.\"\nTrump is not alone in wanting to bring back torture to the U.S. foreign policy toolkit. Though perhaps not as vocal, other Republican candidates consider a return to the use of torture if elected. Marco Rubio defends the Bush administration's authorization of torture, while Ted Cruz claims that waterboarding doesn't qualify as torture.\nThe United States has a dark recent past on torture and loose talk by Republicans -- particularly Trump as the party's frontrunner -- on torture damages the country's ability to repair its reputation abroad. More importantly, there are direct links between torture and making America less safe. The policy and talk thereof should hence be returned to the abyss that it was buried in by President Obama over seven years ago.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.","gunning_fog_5":"10.0","flesch_5":"12.3","readability_5":"42.72","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.604166666666667,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-07T22:56:05+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952806819,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:42:20+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T22:15:38+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"San Jose","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915113,"worker_id":32641084,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.940777777777778,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"-1","q2":"-1","q3":"1","q4":"1","q5":"0","q6":"0","q7":"-1","q8":"1","q9":"0","q10":"2","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"7","index_1":"37","title_1":"Cuomo: New Yorkers Not ‘Judgmental’ Like Cruz","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/15/cuomo-new-yorkers-not-judgmental-like-cruz/","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Abortion","body_1":"Sen. Ted Cruz’s attack on “ New York values” has attracted the ire of a prominent New Yorker: Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nIn three TV interviews on Friday, the morning after the most recent GOP presidential debate, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, excoriated Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, for his comments the previous evening.\n“We’re not judgmental, negative and hostile, the way Cruz was,” Mr. Cuomo told NY1. “In one, 30-second sound-bite, he was offensive to gays, he was offensive to women, he offended 18 million New Yorkers — one of the largest Congressional delegations, by the way, in the country.”\nA Cruz spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Cruz has criticized Donald Trump for embodying  “New York values.” During the debate, he was asked about what he meant by that. He said: “Everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.”\n“I guess I can frame it another way,” he added: “Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying.”\nMr. Trump responded by noting conservative giant William F. Buckley was a New Yorker and cited the resilience of New Yorkers following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nIn the NY1 interview, Mr. Cuomo, along with describing Mr. Cruz’s remarks as designed to “spread fear,” said they were inaccurate: “We have a significant conservative party and movement in New York. About 30% of New Yorkers will tell you they are conservatives. Trust me,” he said, “I deal with them every day.”\nMr. Cuomo also pegged Mr. Cruz as a hypocrite for having fundraised in New York, which the senator has done on numerous occasions. “I’m sure Ted Cruz was very negative about New York money,” the governor said, mockingly. “I’m sure he’s not going to accept any money from any New Yorker. I’m sure if he has, he’s going to return all of those contributions.”\nAdded Mr. Cuomo: “I’m always open to give him an education on what New York values are all about. And if he had any class, he would apologize to the people of New York — not that I believe they need it, or they want it. But if he had any class, he would apologize.”\nAside from NY1, Mr. Cuomo also appeared on MSNBC and CNN.\nThe governor wasn’t the only New York official to pounce on Mr. Cruz. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that he was “disgusted” by the senator’s remarks.\nSaid Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat: “I find myself, for once, in agreement with Donald Trump. I think it was right for Donald Trump to defend New York City, and to talk about the heroic actions of the people of this city after 9/11.”","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"7","title_2":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Tells Minnesotans They Can ‘Make History’","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-tells-minnesotans-they-can-make-history/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"MINNEAPOLIS — On the eve of voting in 11 Democratic contests, Bernie Sanders told hundreds of supporters here on Monday that he was counting on them to defeat Hillary Clinton and start a political revolution.\n\nMr. Sanders, eager to bounce back from back-to-back losses in Nevada and South Carolina, cast the primaries and caucuses on Tuesday as a chance to “make history” and show that the coalition of young and working-class people he hopes to bring together can help him win the Democratic presidential nomination. The senator also criticized Mrs. Clinton on several fronts: her praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, her ties to Wall Street and her stances on trade policies.\n\n“The truth is, tomorrow is important and key,” Mr. Sanders said, adding, as usual, that a high voter turnout would benefit him. “We can win, no question, here in Minnesota — if we have the turnout.”\n\nMr. Sanders also said it was important that voters understood the differences between him and Mrs. Clinton. He stressed that he did not have a “super PAC” as she does and that Mrs. Clinton supported several trade policies that he believes led to millions of people losing their jobs. He also chastised her admiration for Mr. Kissinger.\n\n“She looked to Henry Kissinger as one of her mentors,” Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd booed. “I will not look to Henry Kissinger for guidance. In fact, Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.”\n\nMr. Sanders, delivering a stump speech for about 40 minutes, also said that if elected he would change campaign finance laws, devote resources to fighting climate change and work on combating institutional racism. He added that he would push back against laws that in his view suppress voter rights. And he pledged to increase wages and give people access to tuition-free public colleges and universities.\n\nThe senator also talked about providing more resources to American Indians. “We owe Native Americans so, so much,” Mr. Sanders said. “We cannot continue current policies which are so devastating to the Native-American community. That will change under a Sanders administration.”\n\nHis address came after his campaign announced that the senator had raised $36 million  from 1.2 million individual donors in February. The campaign added that they hoped to raise $40 million by the end of Monday — meaning that they are aiming to bring in $4 million in one day.\n\nMr. Sanders also planned to hold a rally in Milton, Mass., on Monday night, the same state where Hillary Clinton campaigned on Monday.","gunning_fog_2":"8.0","flesch_2":"8.0","readability_2":"64.71","index_3":"39","title_3":"First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: Ethanol Subsidies and Shark Jumping","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/05/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-ethanol-subsidies-and-shark-jumping/","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa.

Now, it's being read as an omen of what's to come in 10 days' time when Southern states vote on Super Tuesday.\nCruz once called the God-fearing, gun-toting SEC states that vote then on March 1 his \"firewall,\" but polls show Trump leading in South Carolina, and a dominant performance Saturday would show that Cruz has not been able to sufficiently consolidate the evangelical base that he needs to win down the road in places like Tennessee and Georgia.\nThe recent CNN Poll of Polls shows Trump with an average lead of 16 percentage points over Cruz, though a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey on Friday showed Cruz only 5 points back.\nSeveral people close to the campaign concede that losing South Carolina by double digits would spell serious trouble for Super Tuesday. If it's a tighter loss, some say, it would validate the theory that Trump was susceptible to their attacks and encourage more.\n\"Everybody is watching: Can support be stripped from Donald Trump?\" one pro-Cruz fundraiser asked, predicting that if Trump only earns between 25% and 30%, it will \"unleash\" a new wave of anti-Trump money. \"Then people will realize Trump can be beaten in a lot of the March 1 states.\" \n\"But if Trump gets 38 or 40 -- and Cruz is second with 22 or something like that -- it's going to be very ominous,\" the fundraiser added.\nAll week, Cruz has campaigned with the same urgency seen in the lead-up to Iowa, gleefully drawing sharp contrasts with Trump and Rubio alike. He has rolled out his best endorsements, including one from Rep. Mark Sanford on Friday. And he has showed an awareness of the high stakes on Saturday for his campaign, where the narrative could begin to swing against him in the South.\n\"Twenty-one hours. That's how long we've got until the polls close,\" Cruz said in Myrtle Beach. \"These next 21 hours are going to decide a great deal.\"\n\nCruz allies are doing everything they can to separate their candidate's fortunes in South Carolina from those elsewhere in the South. \nThe campaign points to a national NBC/Wall Street Journal survey this week that showed Cruz leading Trump by 2 points, although other national polls still have the New York businessman easily in the lead. They also maintain that Trump's position on abortion and his recent comments about the presidency of George W. Bush will doom him in the South. \n\"It's a little tough to do an exact extrapolation between what happened in South Carolina and on March 1,\" said Jason Miller, a senior Cruz adviser, who stressed that Cruz has already proven in Iowa that it can turn out his voters. \"These are states that Ted Cruz matches up well in.\" \nCruz surrogate Jack Kingston, a former congressman from just over the border in Georgia, went so far as to tell reporters Thursday that Cruz \"shouldn't even be viable\" in South Carolina, quite the departure from a state that Cruz's team once saw as winnable. \nGlenn Beck: God took Scalia to give America Ted Cruz as president\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of March 1 to Cruz's self-professed path to victory -- he has made the date, which will award more delegates than any other day in the Republican calendar, the cornerstone of his strategy. \nAllies tell CNN Cruz is hoping to win 60% of the delegates there. He scrapped time in Iowa to take two barnstorming bus tours of the south. He's called his operation three to five times better than the rest of the field's. And the core of Cruz's SEC stronghold, his home state of Texas, is still unlikely to be pierced.\n\nThe Cruz campaign appears as occupied with Marco Rubio leapfrogging them into third place as it is with catching Trump for first. It releases anti-Rubio attack ads at a daily rate and has jumped squarely into a messy, seemingly endless argument with Rubio's over Facebook pages and Photoshopped images.\nMiller and Cruz aides are trying to hoist Rubio's expectations as high as possible: Given Rubio's endorsements here, including Gov. Nikki Haley, Cruz's team argues Rubio needs to outright win the state in order to meet them.\nAs for Trump, the plan is simple: attack.\nWith the race shifting to a national campaign defined more by expensive television ads than retail politics, some Cruz supporters have faith that South Carolina will show that negative ads like those Cruz forces have aired against Trump will work. After largely skating free in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump is finally being attacked by a battery of super PACs. \nCruz's campaign is hitting Trump on those issues, airing ads featuring Trump's 1999 interview with the late Tim Russert in which he declares he is \"pro-choice.\" (Trump maintains his position has changed and sent Cruz a cease-and-desist letter, which Cruz laughed off.) \nTed Cruz to Donald Trump: Sue me\nAssuming Cruz does hold off Rubio, though, the key will be how large the margin of loss is to Trump, who also holds a large lead in Nevada. \n\"If Trump wins and we're second, the SEC primary becomes a 50/50 scenario,\" said one Cruz insider. \"It's our territory, but he'll have the momentum.\" \nIn the meantime, Cruz is trying his best to look ahead. When a foreign-born woman who now lives in Georgia crossed the Carolina border to see Cruz in Greenville on Thursday, Cruz was as eager to get her to the ballot box as she was herself. \n\"The reason I became an American citizen is so I can vote for people like you,\" Hannah Kanner, born in communist Czechoslovakia, told him. \"I'm from Georgia -- sorry! I wish I could vote on Saturday, but I can't.\" \n\"On March 1,\" Cruz replied, \"you can.\"","gunning_fog_4":"10.4","flesch_4":"9.1","readability_4":"67.08","index_5":"112","title_5":"Donald Trump just plain wrong on torture (opinion)","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/opinions/trump-torture-bergenas/index.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_5":"Johan Bergenas is a senior associate at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, a nonprofit institution devoted to enhancing international peace and security through analysis and outreach. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.\n (CNN) Donald Trump says that \"torture works\" and that if elected president, he will bring back waterboarding.\nIn fact, he says he will allow techniques \"a hell of a lot worse\" than waterboarding and use them regardless of effectiveness on terrorist organizations like ISIS because they \"deserve it.\" \nBy advocating that the United States brings back torture, Trump again demonstrates his astute understanding of the American electorate. Fifty-three percent of Americans say that torturing terrorists can be justified. Polling only Republicans, the slice of the electorate Trump is trying to charm in this primary season, the number is even larger, over 70%.\nOne reason behind these large numbers can be gathered from psychological studies in which individuals support the use of torture when the subject is categorized as a terrorist, regardless of its intelligence value.\nIt may be smart politics to support torture, but Trump's eye-for-an-eye approach to defeat terrorist networks will make the United States less, not more, safe and the American electorate needs to know why, before more ballots are cast.\nIn fact, today most government officials, regardless of party affiliation, experts and scientists agree with Republican Sen. John McCain that torture \"compromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good.\"\nImportantly, there is also widespread agreement that American use of torture serves as a recruitment magnet for the world's terrorist networks. Several high ranking government officials note how al Qaeda use Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay as symbolic recruiting tools to reinforce anti-American sentiment and grow their numbers.\nIn short, Trump's torture policy will fuel the same terrorist organizations that he wants to destroy.\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order banning waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques -- the methods Trump says he would reinstall if elected. Instead Obama favors methods that glean intelligence without sacrificing America's ideals, such as a rapport-building approach that is far more likely to elicit good and earlier intelligence than torture. \nWhen issuing the executive order, the President said that enhanced interrogation methods \"serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists and they increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. ... They did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them.\"\nTrump is not alone in wanting to bring back torture to the U.S. foreign policy toolkit. Though perhaps not as vocal, other Republican candidates consider a return to the use of torture if elected. Marco Rubio defends the Bush administration's authorization of torture, while Ted Cruz claims that waterboarding doesn't qualify as torture.\nThe United States has a dark recent past on torture and loose talk by Republicans -- particularly Trump as the party's frontrunner -- on torture damages the country's ability to repair its reputation abroad. More importantly, there are direct links between torture and making America less safe. The policy and talk thereof should hence be returned to the abyss that it was buried in by President Obama over seven years ago.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.","gunning_fog_5":"10.0","flesch_5":"12.3","readability_5":"42.72","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo.

We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}},{"id":1952814781,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:53:37+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T22:51:53+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"San Jose","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915113,"worker_id":36461899,"trust":0.65625,"worker_trust":0.915625,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"-1","g2":"-1","q1":"-1","q2":"0","q3":"-1","q4":"0","q5":"-1","q6":"0","q7":"-1","q8":"0","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"donald_trump"},"unit_data":{"nil":"7","index_1":"37","title_1":"Cuomo: New Yorkers Not ‘Judgmental’ Like Cruz","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/15/cuomo-new-yorkers-not-judgmental-like-cruz/","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Abortion","body_1":"Sen. Ted Cruz’s attack on “ New York values” has attracted the ire of a prominent New Yorker: Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nIn three TV interviews on Friday, the morning after the most recent GOP presidential debate, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, excoriated Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, for his comments the previous evening.\n“We’re not judgmental, negative and hostile, the way Cruz was,” Mr. Cuomo told NY1. “In one, 30-second sound-bite, he was offensive to gays, he was offensive to women, he offended 18 million New Yorkers — one of the largest Congressional delegations, by the way, in the country.”\nA Cruz spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Cruz has criticized Donald Trump for embodying  “New York values.” During the debate, he was asked about what he meant by that. He said: “Everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.”\n“I guess I can frame it another way,” he added: “Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying.”\nMr. Trump responded by noting conservative giant William F. Buckley was a New Yorker and cited the resilience of New Yorkers following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nIn the NY1 interview, Mr. Cuomo, along with describing Mr. Cruz’s remarks as designed to “spread fear,” said they were inaccurate: “We have a significant conservative party and movement in New York. About 30% of New Yorkers will tell you they are conservatives. Trust me,” he said, “I deal with them every day.”\nMr. Cuomo also pegged Mr. Cruz as a hypocrite for having fundraised in New York, which the senator has done on numerous occasions. “I’m sure Ted Cruz was very negative about New York money,” the governor said, mockingly. “I’m sure he’s not going to accept any money from any New Yorker. I’m sure if he has, he’s going to return all of those contributions.”\nAdded Mr. Cuomo: “I’m always open to give him an education on what New York values are all about. And if he had any class, he would apologize to the people of New York — not that I believe they need it, or they want it. But if he had any class, he would apologize.”\nAside from NY1, Mr. Cuomo also appeared on MSNBC and CNN.\nThe governor wasn’t the only New York official to pounce on Mr. Cruz. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that he was “disgusted” by the senator’s remarks.\nSaid Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat: “I find myself, for once, in agreement with Donald Trump. I think it was right for Donald Trump to defend New York City, and to talk about the heroic actions of the people of this city after 9/11.”","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"7","title_2":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Tells Minnesotans They Can ‘Make History’","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-tells-minnesotans-they-can-make-history/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"MINNEAPOLIS — On the eve of voting in 11 Democratic contests, Bernie Sanders told hundreds of supporters here on Monday that he was counting on them to defeat Hillary Clinton and start a political revolution.\n\nMr. Sanders, eager to bounce back from back-to-back losses in Nevada and South Carolina, cast the primaries and caucuses on Tuesday as a chance to “make history” and show that the coalition of young and working-class people he hopes to bring together can help him win the Democratic presidential nomination. The senator also criticized Mrs. Clinton on several fronts: her praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, her ties to Wall Street and her stances on trade policies.\n\n“The truth is, tomorrow is important and key,” Mr. Sanders said, adding, as usual, that a high voter turnout would benefit him. “We can win, no question, here in Minnesota — if we have the turnout.”\n\nMr. Sanders also said it was important that voters understood the differences between him and Mrs. Clinton. He stressed that he did not have a “super PAC” as she does and that Mrs. Clinton supported several trade policies that he believes led to millions of people losing their jobs. He also chastised her admiration for Mr. Kissinger.\n\n“She looked to Henry Kissinger as one of her mentors,” Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd booed. “I will not look to Henry Kissinger for guidance. In fact, Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.”\n\nMr. Sanders, delivering a stump speech for about 40 minutes, also said that if elected he would change campaign finance laws, devote resources to fighting climate change and work on combating institutional racism. He added that he would push back against laws that in his view suppress voter rights. And he pledged to increase wages and give people access to tuition-free public colleges and universities.\n\nThe senator also talked about providing more resources to American Indians. “We owe Native Americans so, so much,” Mr. Sanders said. “We cannot continue current policies which are so devastating to the Native-American community. That will change under a Sanders administration.”\n\nHis address came after his campaign announced that the senator had raised $36 million  from 1.2 million individual donors in February. The campaign added that they hoped to raise $40 million by the end of Monday — meaning that they are aiming to bring in $4 million in one day.\n\nMr. Sanders also planned to hold a rally in Milton, Mass., on Monday night, the same state where Hillary Clinton campaigned on Monday.","gunning_fog_2":"8.0","flesch_2":"8.0","readability_2":"64.71","index_3":"39","title_3":"First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: Ethanol Subsidies and Shark Jumping","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/05/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-ethanol-subsidies-and-shark-jumping/","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa.

Now, it's being read as an omen of what's to come in 10 days' time when Southern states vote on Super Tuesday.\nCruz once called the God-fearing, gun-toting SEC states that vote then on March 1 his \"firewall,\" but polls show Trump leading in South Carolina, and a dominant performance Saturday would show that Cruz has not been able to sufficiently consolidate the evangelical base that he needs to win down the road in places like Tennessee and Georgia.\nThe recent CNN Poll of Polls shows Trump with an average lead of 16 percentage points over Cruz, though a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey on Friday showed Cruz only 5 points back.\nSeveral people close to the campaign concede that losing South Carolina by double digits would spell serious trouble for Super Tuesday. If it's a tighter loss, some say, it would validate the theory that Trump was susceptible to their attacks and encourage more.\n\"Everybody is watching: Can support be stripped from Donald Trump?\" one pro-Cruz fundraiser asked, predicting that if Trump only earns between 25% and 30%, it will \"unleash\" a new wave of anti-Trump money. \"Then people will realize Trump can be beaten in a lot of the March 1 states.\" \n\"But if Trump gets 38 or 40 -- and Cruz is second with 22 or something like that -- it's going to be very ominous,\" the fundraiser added.\nAll week, Cruz has campaigned with the same urgency seen in the lead-up to Iowa, gleefully drawing sharp contrasts with Trump and Rubio alike. He has rolled out his best endorsements, including one from Rep. Mark Sanford on Friday. And he has showed an awareness of the high stakes on Saturday for his campaign, where the narrative could begin to swing against him in the South.\n\"Twenty-one hours. That's how long we've got until the polls close,\" Cruz said in Myrtle Beach. \"These next 21 hours are going to decide a great deal.\"\n\nCruz allies are doing everything they can to separate their candidate's fortunes in South Carolina from those elsewhere in the South. \nThe campaign points to a national NBC/Wall Street Journal survey this week that showed Cruz leading Trump by 2 points, although other national polls still have the New York businessman easily in the lead. They also maintain that Trump's position on abortion and his recent comments about the presidency of George W. Bush will doom him in the South. \n\"It's a little tough to do an exact extrapolation between what happened in South Carolina and on March 1,\" said Jason Miller, a senior Cruz adviser, who stressed that Cruz has already proven in Iowa that it can turn out his voters. \"These are states that Ted Cruz matches up well in.\" \nCruz surrogate Jack Kingston, a former congressman from just over the border in Georgia, went so far as to tell reporters Thursday that Cruz \"shouldn't even be viable\" in South Carolina, quite the departure from a state that Cruz's team once saw as winnable. \nGlenn Beck: God took Scalia to give America Ted Cruz as president\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of March 1 to Cruz's self-professed path to victory -- he has made the date, which will award more delegates than any other day in the Republican calendar, the cornerstone of his strategy. \nAllies tell CNN Cruz is hoping to win 60% of the delegates there. He scrapped time in Iowa to take two barnstorming bus tours of the south. He's called his operation three to five times better than the rest of the field's. And the core of Cruz's SEC stronghold, his home state of Texas, is still unlikely to be pierced.\n\nThe Cruz campaign appears as occupied with Marco Rubio leapfrogging them into third place as it is with catching Trump for first. It releases anti-Rubio attack ads at a daily rate and has jumped squarely into a messy, seemingly endless argument with Rubio's over Facebook pages and Photoshopped images.\nMiller and Cruz aides are trying to hoist Rubio's expectations as high as possible: Given Rubio's endorsements here, including Gov. Nikki Haley, Cruz's team argues Rubio needs to outright win the state in order to meet them.\nAs for Trump, the plan is simple: attack.\nWith the race shifting to a national campaign defined more by expensive television ads than retail politics, some Cruz supporters have faith that South Carolina will show that negative ads like those Cruz forces have aired against Trump will work. After largely skating free in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump is finally being attacked by a battery of super PACs. \nCruz's campaign is hitting Trump on those issues, airing ads featuring Trump's 1999 interview with the late Tim Russert in which he declares he is \"pro-choice.\" (Trump maintains his position has changed and sent Cruz a cease-and-desist letter, which Cruz laughed off.) \nTed Cruz to Donald Trump: Sue me\nAssuming Cruz does hold off Rubio, though, the key will be how large the margin of loss is to Trump, who also holds a large lead in Nevada. \n\"If Trump wins and we're second, the SEC primary becomes a 50/50 scenario,\" said one Cruz insider. \"It's our territory, but he'll have the momentum.\" \nIn the meantime, Cruz is trying his best to look ahead. When a foreign-born woman who now lives in Georgia crossed the Carolina border to see Cruz in Greenville on Thursday, Cruz was as eager to get her to the ballot box as she was herself. \n\"The reason I became an American citizen is so I can vote for people like you,\" Hannah Kanner, born in communist Czechoslovakia, told him. \"I'm from Georgia -- sorry! I wish I could vote on Saturday, but I can't.\" \n\"On March 1,\" Cruz replied, \"you can.\"","gunning_fog_4":"10.4","flesch_4":"9.1","readability_4":"67.08","index_5":"112","title_5":"Donald Trump just plain wrong on torture (opinion)","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/opinions/trump-torture-bergenas/index.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_5":"Johan Bergenas is a senior associate at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, a nonprofit institution devoted to enhancing international peace and security through analysis and outreach. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.\n (CNN) Donald Trump says that \"torture works\" and that if elected president, he will bring back waterboarding.\nIn fact, he says he will allow techniques \"a hell of a lot worse\" than waterboarding and use them regardless of effectiveness on terrorist organizations like ISIS because they \"deserve it.\" \nBy advocating that the United States brings back torture, Trump again demonstrates his astute understanding of the American electorate. Fifty-three percent of Americans say that torturing terrorists can be justified. Polling only Republicans, the slice of the electorate Trump is trying to charm in this primary season, the number is even larger, over 70%.\nOne reason behind these large numbers can be gathered from psychological studies in which individuals support the use of torture when the subject is categorized as a terrorist, regardless of its intelligence value.\nIt may be smart politics to support torture, but Trump's eye-for-an-eye approach to defeat terrorist networks will make the United States less, not more, safe and the American electorate needs to know why, before more ballots are cast.\nIn fact, today most government officials, regardless of party affiliation, experts and scientists agree with Republican Sen. John McCain that torture \"compromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good.\"\nImportantly, there is also widespread agreement that American use of torture serves as a recruitment magnet for the world's terrorist networks. Several high ranking government officials note how al Qaeda use Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay as symbolic recruiting tools to reinforce anti-American sentiment and grow their numbers.\nIn short, Trump's torture policy will fuel the same terrorist organizations that he wants to destroy.\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order banning waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques -- the methods Trump says he would reinstall if elected. Instead Obama favors methods that glean intelligence without sacrificing America's ideals, such as a rapport-building approach that is far more likely to elicit good and earlier intelligence than torture. \nWhen issuing the executive order, the President said that enhanced interrogation methods \"serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists and they increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. ... They did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them.\"\nTrump is not alone in wanting to bring back torture to the U.S. foreign policy toolkit. Though perhaps not as vocal, other Republican candidates consider a return to the use of torture if elected. Marco Rubio defends the Bush administration's authorization of torture, while Ted Cruz claims that waterboarding doesn't qualify as torture.\nThe United States has a dark recent past on torture and loose talk by Republicans -- particularly Trump as the party's frontrunner -- on torture damages the country's ability to repair its reputation abroad. More importantly, there are direct links between torture and making America less safe. The policy and talk thereof should hence be returned to the abyss that it was buried in by President Obama over seven years ago.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.","gunning_fog_5":"10.0","flesch_5":"12.3","readability_5":"42.72","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}},{"id":1952816399,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:55:51+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T22:47:36+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"zoombucks","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"IN","city":"Warsaw","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915113,"worker_id":7876293,"trust":0.520833333333333,"worker_trust":0.90625,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"-1","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"-1","q6":"-2","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"5064","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"7","index_1":"37","title_1":"Cuomo: New Yorkers Not ‘Judgmental’ Like Cruz","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/15/cuomo-new-yorkers-not-judgmental-like-cruz/","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Abortion","body_1":"Sen. Ted Cruz’s attack on “ New York values” has attracted the ire of a prominent New Yorker: Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nIn three TV interviews on Friday, the morning after the most recent GOP presidential debate, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, excoriated Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, for his comments the previous evening.\n“We’re not judgmental, negative and hostile, the way Cruz was,” Mr. Cuomo told NY1. “In one, 30-second sound-bite, he was offensive to gays, he was offensive to women, he offended 18 million New Yorkers — one of the largest Congressional delegations, by the way, in the country.”\nA Cruz spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Cruz has criticized Donald Trump for embodying  “New York values.” During the debate, he was asked about what he meant by that. He said: “Everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.”\n“I guess I can frame it another way,” he added: “Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying.”\nMr. Trump responded by noting conservative giant William F. Buckley was a New Yorker and cited the resilience of New Yorkers following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nIn the NY1 interview, Mr. Cuomo, along with describing Mr. Cruz’s remarks as designed to “spread fear,” said they were inaccurate: “We have a significant conservative party and movement in New York. About 30% of New Yorkers will tell you they are conservatives. Trust me,” he said, “I deal with them every day.”\nMr. Cuomo also pegged Mr. Cruz as a hypocrite for having fundraised in New York, which the senator has done on numerous occasions. “I’m sure Ted Cruz was very negative about New York money,” the governor said, mockingly. “I’m sure he’s not going to accept any money from any New Yorker. I’m sure if he has, he’s going to return all of those contributions.”\nAdded Mr. Cuomo: “I’m always open to give him an education on what New York values are all about. And if he had any class, he would apologize to the people of New York — not that I believe they need it, or they want it. But if he had any class, he would apologize.”\nAside from NY1, Mr. Cuomo also appeared on MSNBC and CNN.\nThe governor wasn’t the only New York official to pounce on Mr. Cruz. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that he was “disgusted” by the senator’s remarks.\nSaid Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat: “I find myself, for once, in agreement with Donald Trump. I think it was right for Donald Trump to defend New York City, and to talk about the heroic actions of the people of this city after 9/11.”","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"7","title_2":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Tells Minnesotans They Can ‘Make History’","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-tells-minnesotans-they-can-make-history/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"MINNEAPOLIS — On the eve of voting in 11 Democratic contests, Bernie Sanders told hundreds of supporters here on Monday that he was counting on them to defeat Hillary Clinton and start a political revolution.\n\nMr. Sanders, eager to bounce back from back-to-back losses in Nevada and South Carolina, cast the primaries and caucuses on Tuesday as a chance to “make history” and show that the coalition of young and working-class people he hopes to bring together can help him win the Democratic presidential nomination. The senator also criticized Mrs. Clinton on several fronts: her praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, her ties to Wall Street and her stances on trade policies.\n\n“The truth is, tomorrow is important and key,” Mr. Sanders said, adding, as usual, that a high voter turnout would benefit him. “We can win, no question, here in Minnesota — if we have the turnout.”\n\nMr. Sanders also said it was important that voters understood the differences between him and Mrs. Clinton. He stressed that he did not have a “super PAC” as she does and that Mrs. Clinton supported several trade policies that he believes led to millions of people losing their jobs. He also chastised her admiration for Mr. Kissinger.\n\n“She looked to Henry Kissinger as one of her mentors,” Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd booed. “I will not look to Henry Kissinger for guidance. In fact, Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.”\n\nMr. Sanders, delivering a stump speech for about 40 minutes, also said that if elected he would change campaign finance laws, devote resources to fighting climate change and work on combating institutional racism. He added that he would push back against laws that in his view suppress voter rights. And he pledged to increase wages and give people access to tuition-free public colleges and universities.\n\nThe senator also talked about providing more resources to American Indians. “We owe Native Americans so, so much,” Mr. Sanders said. “We cannot continue current policies which are so devastating to the Native-American community. That will change under a Sanders administration.”\n\nHis address came after his campaign announced that the senator had raised $36 million  from 1.2 million individual donors in February. The campaign added that they hoped to raise $40 million by the end of Monday — meaning that they are aiming to bring in $4 million in one day.\n\nMr. Sanders also planned to hold a rally in Milton, Mass., on Monday night, the same state where Hillary Clinton campaigned on Monday.","gunning_fog_2":"8.0","flesch_2":"8.0","readability_2":"64.71","index_3":"39","title_3":"First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: Ethanol Subsidies and Shark Jumping","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/05/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-ethanol-subsidies-and-shark-jumping/","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa.

Now, it's being read as an omen of what's to come in 10 days' time when Southern states vote on Super Tuesday.\nCruz once called the God-fearing, gun-toting SEC states that vote then on March 1 his \"firewall,\" but polls show Trump leading in South Carolina, and a dominant performance Saturday would show that Cruz has not been able to sufficiently consolidate the evangelical base that he needs to win down the road in places like Tennessee and Georgia.\nThe recent CNN Poll of Polls shows Trump with an average lead of 16 percentage points over Cruz, though a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey on Friday showed Cruz only 5 points back.\nSeveral people close to the campaign concede that losing South Carolina by double digits would spell serious trouble for Super Tuesday. If it's a tighter loss, some say, it would validate the theory that Trump was susceptible to their attacks and encourage more.\n\"Everybody is watching: Can support be stripped from Donald Trump?\" one pro-Cruz fundraiser asked, predicting that if Trump only earns between 25% and 30%, it will \"unleash\" a new wave of anti-Trump money. \"Then people will realize Trump can be beaten in a lot of the March 1 states.\" \n\"But if Trump gets 38 or 40 -- and Cruz is second with 22 or something like that -- it's going to be very ominous,\" the fundraiser added.\nAll week, Cruz has campaigned with the same urgency seen in the lead-up to Iowa, gleefully drawing sharp contrasts with Trump and Rubio alike. He has rolled out his best endorsements, including one from Rep. Mark Sanford on Friday. And he has showed an awareness of the high stakes on Saturday for his campaign, where the narrative could begin to swing against him in the South.\n\"Twenty-one hours. That's how long we've got until the polls close,\" Cruz said in Myrtle Beach. \"These next 21 hours are going to decide a great deal.\"\n\nCruz allies are doing everything they can to separate their candidate's fortunes in South Carolina from those elsewhere in the South. \nThe campaign points to a national NBC/Wall Street Journal survey this week that showed Cruz leading Trump by 2 points, although other national polls still have the New York businessman easily in the lead. They also maintain that Trump's position on abortion and his recent comments about the presidency of George W. Bush will doom him in the South. \n\"It's a little tough to do an exact extrapolation between what happened in South Carolina and on March 1,\" said Jason Miller, a senior Cruz adviser, who stressed that Cruz has already proven in Iowa that it can turn out his voters. \"These are states that Ted Cruz matches up well in.\" \nCruz surrogate Jack Kingston, a former congressman from just over the border in Georgia, went so far as to tell reporters Thursday that Cruz \"shouldn't even be viable\" in South Carolina, quite the departure from a state that Cruz's team once saw as winnable. \nGlenn Beck: God took Scalia to give America Ted Cruz as president\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of March 1 to Cruz's self-professed path to victory -- he has made the date, which will award more delegates than any other day in the Republican calendar, the cornerstone of his strategy. \nAllies tell CNN Cruz is hoping to win 60% of the delegates there. He scrapped time in Iowa to take two barnstorming bus tours of the south. He's called his operation three to five times better than the rest of the field's. And the core of Cruz's SEC stronghold, his home state of Texas, is still unlikely to be pierced.\n\nThe Cruz campaign appears as occupied with Marco Rubio leapfrogging them into third place as it is with catching Trump for first. It releases anti-Rubio attack ads at a daily rate and has jumped squarely into a messy, seemingly endless argument with Rubio's over Facebook pages and Photoshopped images.\nMiller and Cruz aides are trying to hoist Rubio's expectations as high as possible: Given Rubio's endorsements here, including Gov. Nikki Haley, Cruz's team argues Rubio needs to outright win the state in order to meet them.\nAs for Trump, the plan is simple: attack.\nWith the race shifting to a national campaign defined more by expensive television ads than retail politics, some Cruz supporters have faith that South Carolina will show that negative ads like those Cruz forces have aired against Trump will work. After largely skating free in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump is finally being attacked by a battery of super PACs. \nCruz's campaign is hitting Trump on those issues, airing ads featuring Trump's 1999 interview with the late Tim Russert in which he declares he is \"pro-choice.\" (Trump maintains his position has changed and sent Cruz a cease-and-desist letter, which Cruz laughed off.) \nTed Cruz to Donald Trump: Sue me\nAssuming Cruz does hold off Rubio, though, the key will be how large the margin of loss is to Trump, who also holds a large lead in Nevada. \n\"If Trump wins and we're second, the SEC primary becomes a 50/50 scenario,\" said one Cruz insider. \"It's our territory, but he'll have the momentum.\" \nIn the meantime, Cruz is trying his best to look ahead. When a foreign-born woman who now lives in Georgia crossed the Carolina border to see Cruz in Greenville on Thursday, Cruz was as eager to get her to the ballot box as she was herself. \n\"The reason I became an American citizen is so I can vote for people like you,\" Hannah Kanner, born in communist Czechoslovakia, told him. \"I'm from Georgia -- sorry! I wish I could vote on Saturday, but I can't.\" \n\"On March 1,\" Cruz replied, \"you can.\"","gunning_fog_4":"10.4","flesch_4":"9.1","readability_4":"67.08","index_5":"112","title_5":"Donald Trump just plain wrong on torture (opinion)","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/opinions/trump-torture-bergenas/index.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_5":"Johan Bergenas is a senior associate at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, a nonprofit institution devoted to enhancing international peace and security through analysis and outreach. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.\n (CNN) Donald Trump says that \"torture works\" and that if elected president, he will bring back waterboarding.\nIn fact, he says he will allow techniques \"a hell of a lot worse\" than waterboarding and use them regardless of effectiveness on terrorist organizations like ISIS because they \"deserve it.\" \nBy advocating that the United States brings back torture, Trump again demonstrates his astute understanding of the American electorate. Fifty-three percent of Americans say that torturing terrorists can be justified. Polling only Republicans, the slice of the electorate Trump is trying to charm in this primary season, the number is even larger, over 70%.\nOne reason behind these large numbers can be gathered from psychological studies in which individuals support the use of torture when the subject is categorized as a terrorist, regardless of its intelligence value.\nIt may be smart politics to support torture, but Trump's eye-for-an-eye approach to defeat terrorist networks will make the United States less, not more, safe and the American electorate needs to know why, before more ballots are cast.\nIn fact, today most government officials, regardless of party affiliation, experts and scientists agree with Republican Sen. John McCain that torture \"compromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good.\"\nImportantly, there is also widespread agreement that American use of torture serves as a recruitment magnet for the world's terrorist networks. Several high ranking government officials note how al Qaeda use Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay as symbolic recruiting tools to reinforce anti-American sentiment and grow their numbers.\nIn short, Trump's torture policy will fuel the same terrorist organizations that he wants to destroy.\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order banning waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques -- the methods Trump says he would reinstall if elected. Instead Obama favors methods that glean intelligence without sacrificing America's ideals, such as a rapport-building approach that is far more likely to elicit good and earlier intelligence than torture. \nWhen issuing the executive order, the President said that enhanced interrogation methods \"serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists and they increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. ... They did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them.\"\nTrump is not alone in wanting to bring back torture to the U.S. foreign policy toolkit. Though perhaps not as vocal, other Republican candidates consider a return to the use of torture if elected. Marco Rubio defends the Bush administration's authorization of torture, while Ted Cruz claims that waterboarding doesn't qualify as torture.\nThe United States has a dark recent past on torture and loose talk by Republicans -- particularly Trump as the party's frontrunner -- on torture damages the country's ability to repair its reputation abroad. More importantly, there are direct links between torture and making America less safe. The policy and talk thereof should hence be returned to the abyss that it was buried in by President Obama over seven years ago.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.","gunning_fog_5":"10.0","flesch_5":"12.3","readability_5":"42.72","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen.

Barring new and damaging revelations, many Iowa Republicans now think the only thing standing between him and a victory on Feb. 1 is a groundswell of first-time or infrequent voters turning out for Donald J. Trump, of the sort that materialized for Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nMr. Cruz has gotten to this point by amassing an energized and growing coalition of Christian activists and anti-establishment Republicans, an extensive organization and a deep reservoir of money. But he is also benefiting from a splintered opposition that lacks either the money or the will to halt his rise.\n\nSome supporters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for example, privately say they believe Mr. Cruz cannot be defeated in Iowa. While those claims may in part be gamesmanship — an attempt to build up Mr. Cruz’s expectations here — more revealing is that neither Mr. Rubio nor the well-financed outside group allied with his campaign has so far spent money on television ads in Iowa assailing Mr. Cruz.\n\n“It does feel like it’s now Cruz’s to lose,” said Matthew N. Strawn, a former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party.\n\nA relatively unimpeded path has left Mr. Cruz the favorite to win the state and emerge as the preferred candidate of the party’s conservative wing. And with a dominant performance here, an unexpectedly strong showing in New Hampshire eight days later and victories in South Carolina and many of the Super Tuesday states on March 1, he could also quickly become something else: the de facto party nominee.\n\nMr. Cruz, obscured for much of last year by a shifting cast of attention-getting rivals, is relishing the turnabout.\n\nBarnstorming Iowa on a six-day, 28-town campaign tour this week, he is even displaying a touch of swagger. He warns Iowans at every stop to expect tens of millions of dollars in ads attacking him to reach their TV screens and mailboxes any day now.\n\nJoined on his 45-foot bus by a phalanx of aides and a camera crew from Showtime, and with a second motor coach carrying a swelling group of reporters, Mr. Cruz boasted about the fresh denunciations being directed his way. “I guess something has changed,” he said with barely concealed delight.\n\nBut what gives his team pause — and what is to many Iowa Republicans the crucial question leading up to Feb. 1 — is whether Mr. Trump will abruptly end his nice-guy routine with Mr. Cruz and begin attacking him in advertisements and behind the microphone at his big, highly publicized rallies.\n\n“I’m a little concerned about that,” Representative Steve King of Iowa, Mr. Cruz’s highest-profile surrogate in the state and travel partner for part of the week, said about the possibility of a Trump offensive. “Trump is so completely unpredictable, we don’t know what he might do campaign-wise. We can’t even begin to think about anticipating that.”\n\nMr. Trump, whom Mr. Cruz praised for months, has begun to taunt the senator, raising questions about his Canadian birthplace and his faith. But he has stopped short of aggressively attacking Mr. Cruz and has run television commercials about only himself so far.\n\nMr. Cruz, responding to the birthplace slight on Tuesday, posted a video clip on Twitter from the infamous jump-the-shark episode of “Happy Days,” but has repeatedly declined to say more.\n\nOther rivals have not given Mr. Cruz a free pass: He is coming under attack from the winners of the last two Iowa caucus votes, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. Both their candidacies, which are barely registering in Iowa polls, depend on a strong result in the caucuses. But both men have little money with which to inflict damage on Mr. Cruz — and nothing like the millions that a “super PAC” supporting Mitt Romney unleashed on Newt Gingrich here in the 2012 campaign.\n\n“They’re fighting with rocks against bazookas,” Mr. Strawn said.\n\nMr. Cruz has become far more entrenched in Iowa than Mr. Gingrich was at the same point in his campaign four years ago. With many conservative activists here feeling a sense of fury toward their party, Mr. Cruz has emerged as the candidate most effectively channeling the boiling anger of Republican hard-liners.\n\nConversations with dozens of Cruz supporters suggest that the deep dismay Iowa Republicans feel toward Washington is prompting them to coalesce behind Mr. Cruz, whom they see as the only viable conservative contender.\n\n“We need a winner,” Susie Lee, 50, said Monday before Mr. Cruz made a late-night stop at a diner in Missouri Valley. “Huckabee and Santorum are great guys, but they haven’t been in office like Senator Cruz has, fighting.”\n\nPamela Oviatt of Logan, a Santorum backer four years ago, showed up before 9 p.m. for Mr. Cruz’s 10:30 p.m. appearance. She said there was little talk among activists for any of his rivals. “Cruz is the only one that’s in the political system now that anybody is looking at twice,” she said.\n\nMs. Oviatt’s distinction about being part of the political system remains a worrisome one for Mr. Cruz’s backers.\n\nIowa Republican leaders say that he is the preferred candidate among traditional activists. “He’s winning the within-the-system, anti-establishment folks,” said Don Kass, Republican chairman in Plymouth County. But the party leaders also say that Mr. Trump is garnering support from people new to the caucuses.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump’s backers here say they are confident that his attacks on the political status quo will bring out thousands of Iowans who have not previously caucused or even registered as Republicans, and his campaign is trying to register supporters as Republicans.\n\nBut state party records indicate only modest increases in the numbers of registered Republicans over recent months, a pattern little different from that in previous election years. There are now just over 612,000 registered Iowa Republicans. In early August, there were just over 609,000.\n\nThe threat Mr. Trump presents has nevertheless cast a shadow of uncertainty over the caucuses and the party. And that, in its own way, has also aided Mr. Cruz: Mark Lundberg, the Sioux County Republican chairman, said he thought Mr. Cruz was one of the few candidates running who could appeal to the angry Trump legions, should Mr. Trump fall short.\n\nMindful of this, Mr. Cruz has seldom mentioned Mr. Trump except to praise him. This week, however, he has started invoking Mr. Trump for another reason.\n\nAsked about attacks by some of his rivals, Mr. Cruz observed that Mr. Trump was the target of a similar barrage a few weeks ago. He also told diners at a steakhouse in Carroll to expect “tens of millions of dollars” in ads assailing him to be unleashed in the coming weeks — the sort of onslaught that a true underdog would never receive.\n\nHis eyes wandering to a political flier on a nearby table, Mr. Cruz seized on a bit of evidence. “I’m looking at a mailer some of y’all may have seen: ‘Ted Cruz is dangerous!’” he read.\n\n“You know what?

To date, Mr. Sanders has raised $95 million.\nThe $20 million haul came from more than 770,000 contributions, with an average donation of $27, his campaign said. Mr. Sanders has received more than 3.25 million donations since starting his campaign, a record number.\nMr. Sanders’s rival, Hillary Clinton, has not reported how much she raised in January and is not required to do so until next month.\nMrs. Clinton was expected to have the strongest fundraising operation in the field. Indeed, she has outraised her rivals in both parties, bringing in $112 million last year. A super PAC supporting her candidacy has raised an additional $50 million.\nBut Mr. Sanders has posed a more significant fundraising threat than expected, raising within a few million dollars of what Mrs. Clinton brought in each quarter.\nMr. Sanders has the advantage over Mrs. Clinton of relying on small donations, rather than on individuals donating the maximum $2,700 for the primary. That allows his campaign to tap previous donors for more funds, rather than finding new supporters. His campaign said Sunday that just 1.3% of its fourth-quarter donations were from donors who had hit the legal maximum.\nThe campaign has not yet filed its fourth-quarter fundraising disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, nor has Mrs. Clintons. Those reports are due by midnight Sunday.\nWorking Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in a statement Sunday.\nTad Devine, a senior strategist to Mr. Sanders, said in a recent interview that the senator’s fundraising prowess boosts his credibility going forward.\n“Part of our argument if were going to win this thing in the long run is to convince the Democratic establishment that the new model of fundraising that he can do is on a scale that doesn’t jeopardize our ability to run a national campaign,” he said.","gunning_fog_3":"8.0","flesch_3":"8.0","readability_3":"64.71","index_4":"44","title_4":"Ted Cruz ad features business suits crossing border","url_4":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-border-ad-business-suits/index.html","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"CNN","top_topic_4":"Immigration","body_4":"Washington (CNN) Immigrants are streaming across our border, and they're wearing pumps and wingtips -- at least according to Sen.

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"\nClinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. \nIn Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. \nThe secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. \n\"So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,\" said Sherman. \"To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.\"\nThe Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.\nPrevious email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. \nThe State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. \nThe conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,\" so it was born classified when the emails were created. \n\"Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,\" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. \"This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.\"\nA Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. \nThe polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important. \n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also Republicans’ best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles. We support Ted Cruz for president."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.729166666666667,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-07T22:50:51+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952807716,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:43:43+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T22:34:49+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"instagc","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"TX","city":"El Paso","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915114,"worker_id":27770607,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.915335968379447,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"0","q2":"2","q3":"0","q4":"2","q5":"0","q6":"2","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"john_kasich"},"unit_data":{"nil":"8","index_1":"38","title_1":"Increasingly, Iowans Say Their Caucuses Are Ted Cruz’s to Lose","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/us/politics/increasingly-iowans-say-their-caucuses-are-ted-cruzs-to-lose.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"ONAWA, Iowa — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas insists he does not want to be seen as the front-runner in the Iowa caucuses. “The only way I know how to run is as an underdog,” he said here after a speech on Tuesday, waving off any Joe Namath-style guarantee of victory.\n\nBut try as he might to hold down expectations, Mr. Cruz has plainly become the candidate to beat in the caucuses.

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"\nClinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. \nIn Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. \nThe secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. \n\"So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,\" said Sherman. \"To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.\"\nThe Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.\nPrevious email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. \nThe State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. \nThe conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,\" so it was born classified when the emails were created. \n\"Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,\" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. \"This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.\"\nA Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. \nThe polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important. \n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also Republicans’ best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles. We support Ted Cruz for president."}},{"id":1952809220,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:45:53+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T22:41:30+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"GA","city":"Atlanta","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915114,"worker_id":11102360,"trust":0.71875,"worker_trust":0.931428571428571,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"1","q2":"1","q3":"1","q4":"1","q5":"0","q6":"1","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"-1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"5064","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"no_affiliation","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"8","index_1":"38","title_1":"Increasingly, Iowans Say Their Caucuses Are Ted Cruz’s to Lose","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/us/politics/increasingly-iowans-say-their-caucuses-are-ted-cruzs-to-lose.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"ONAWA, Iowa — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas insists he does not want to be seen as the front-runner in the Iowa caucuses. “The only way I know how to run is as an underdog,” he said here after a speech on Tuesday, waving off any Joe Namath-style guarantee of victory.\n\nBut try as he might to hold down expectations, Mr. Cruz has plainly become the candidate to beat in the caucuses. Barring new and damaging revelations, many Iowa Republicans now think the only thing standing between him and a victory on Feb. 1 is a groundswell of first-time or infrequent voters turning out for Donald J. Trump, of the sort that materialized for Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nMr. Cruz has gotten to this point by amassing an energized and growing coalition of Christian activists and anti-establishment Republicans, an extensive organization and a deep reservoir of money. But he is also benefiting from a splintered opposition that lacks either the money or the will to halt his rise.\n\nSome supporters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for example, privately say they believe Mr. Cruz cannot be defeated in Iowa. While those claims may in part be gamesmanship — an attempt to build up Mr. Cruz’s expectations here — more revealing is that neither Mr. Rubio nor the well-financed outside group allied with his campaign has so far spent money on television ads in Iowa assailing Mr. Cruz.\n\n“It does feel like it’s now Cruz’s to lose,” said Matthew N. Strawn, a former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party.\n\nA relatively unimpeded path has left Mr. Cruz the favorite to win the state and emerge as the preferred candidate of the party’s conservative wing. And with a dominant performance here, an unexpectedly strong showing in New Hampshire eight days later and victories in South Carolina and many of the Super Tuesday states on March 1, he could also quickly become something else: the de facto party nominee.\n\nMr. Cruz, obscured for much of last year by a shifting cast of attention-getting rivals, is relishing the turnabout.\n\nBarnstorming Iowa on a six-day, 28-town campaign tour this week, he is even displaying a touch of swagger. He warns Iowans at every stop to expect tens of millions of dollars in ads attacking him to reach their TV screens and mailboxes any day now.\n\nJoined on his 45-foot bus by a phalanx of aides and a camera crew from Showtime, and with a second motor coach carrying a swelling group of reporters, Mr. Cruz boasted about the fresh denunciations being directed his way. “I guess something has changed,” he said with barely concealed delight.\n\nBut what gives his team pause — and what is to many Iowa Republicans the crucial question leading up to Feb. 1 — is whether Mr. Trump will abruptly end his nice-guy routine with Mr. Cruz and begin attacking him in advertisements and behind the microphone at his big, highly publicized rallies.\n\n“I’m a little concerned about that,” Representative Steve King of Iowa, Mr. Cruz’s highest-profile surrogate in the state and travel partner for part of the week, said about the possibility of a Trump offensive. “Trump is so completely unpredictable, we don’t know what he might do campaign-wise. We can’t even begin to think about anticipating that.”\n\nMr. Trump, whom Mr. Cruz praised for months, has begun to taunt the senator, raising questions about his Canadian birthplace and his faith. But he has stopped short of aggressively attacking Mr. Cruz and has run television commercials about only himself so far.\n\nMr. Cruz, responding to the birthplace slight on Tuesday, posted a video clip on Twitter from the infamous jump-the-shark episode of “Happy Days,” but has repeatedly declined to say more.\n\nOther rivals have not given Mr. Cruz a free pass: He is coming under attack from the winners of the last two Iowa caucus votes, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. Both their candidacies, which are barely registering in Iowa polls, depend on a strong result in the caucuses. But both men have little money with which to inflict damage on Mr. Cruz — and nothing like the millions that a “super PAC” supporting Mitt Romney unleashed on Newt Gingrich here in the 2012 campaign.\n\n“They’re fighting with rocks against bazookas,” Mr. Strawn said.\n\nMr. Cruz has become far more entrenched in Iowa than Mr. Gingrich was at the same point in his campaign four years ago. With many conservative activists here feeling a sense of fury toward their party, Mr. Cruz has emerged as the candidate most effectively channeling the boiling anger of Republican hard-liners.\n\nConversations with dozens of Cruz supporters suggest that the deep dismay Iowa Republicans feel toward Washington is prompting them to coalesce behind Mr. Cruz, whom they see as the only viable conservative contender.\n\n“We need a winner,” Susie Lee, 50, said Monday before Mr. Cruz made a late-night stop at a diner in Missouri Valley. “Huckabee and Santorum are great guys, but they haven’t been in office like Senator Cruz has, fighting.”\n\nPamela Oviatt of Logan, a Santorum backer four years ago, showed up before 9 p.m. for Mr. Cruz’s 10:30 p.m. appearance. She said there was little talk among activists for any of his rivals. “Cruz is the only one that’s in the political system now that anybody is looking at twice,” she said.\n\nMs. Oviatt’s distinction about being part of the political system remains a worrisome one for Mr. Cruz’s backers.\n\nIowa Republican leaders say that he is the preferred candidate among traditional activists. “He’s winning the within-the-system, anti-establishment folks,” said Don Kass, Republican chairman in Plymouth County. But the party leaders also say that Mr. Trump is garnering support from people new to the caucuses.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump’s backers here say they are confident that his attacks on the political status quo will bring out thousands of Iowans who have not previously caucused or even registered as Republicans, and his campaign is trying to register supporters as Republicans.\n\nBut state party records indicate only modest increases in the numbers of registered Republicans over recent months, a pattern little different from that in previous election years. There are now just over 612,000 registered Iowa Republicans. In early August, there were just over 609,000.\n\nThe threat Mr. Trump presents has nevertheless cast a shadow of uncertainty over the caucuses and the party. And that, in its own way, has also aided Mr. Cruz: Mark Lundberg, the Sioux County Republican chairman, said he thought Mr. Cruz was one of the few candidates running who could appeal to the angry Trump legions, should Mr. Trump fall short.\n\nMindful of this, Mr. Cruz has seldom mentioned Mr. Trump except to praise him. This week, however, he has started invoking Mr. Trump for another reason.\n\nAsked about attacks by some of his rivals, Mr. Cruz observed that Mr. Trump was the target of a similar barrage a few weeks ago.

As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative.

Barring new and damaging revelations, many Iowa Republicans now think the only thing standing between him and a victory on Feb. 1 is a groundswell of first-time or infrequent voters turning out for Donald J. Trump, of the sort that materialized for Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nMr. Cruz has gotten to this point by amassing an energized and growing coalition of Christian activists and anti-establishment Republicans, an extensive organization and a deep reservoir of money. But he is also benefiting from a splintered opposition that lacks either the money or the will to halt his rise.\n\nSome supporters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for example, privately say they believe Mr. Cruz cannot be defeated in Iowa. While those claims may in part be gamesmanship — an attempt to build up Mr. Cruz’s expectations here — more revealing is that neither Mr. Rubio nor the well-financed outside group allied with his campaign has so far spent money on television ads in Iowa assailing Mr. Cruz.\n\n“It does feel like it’s now Cruz’s to lose,” said Matthew N. Strawn, a former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party.\n\nA relatively unimpeded path has left Mr. Cruz the favorite to win the state and emerge as the preferred candidate of the party’s conservative wing. And with a dominant performance here, an unexpectedly strong showing in New Hampshire eight days later and victories in South Carolina and many of the Super Tuesday states on March 1, he could also quickly become something else: the de facto party nominee.\n\nMr. Cruz, obscured for much of last year by a shifting cast of attention-getting rivals, is relishing the turnabout.\n\nBarnstorming Iowa on a six-day, 28-town campaign tour this week, he is even displaying a touch of swagger. He warns Iowans at every stop to expect tens of millions of dollars in ads attacking him to reach their TV screens and mailboxes any day now.\n\nJoined on his 45-foot bus by a phalanx of aides and a camera crew from Showtime, and with a second motor coach carrying a swelling group of reporters, Mr. Cruz boasted about the fresh denunciations being directed his way. “I guess something has changed,” he said with barely concealed delight.\n\nBut what gives his team pause — and what is to many Iowa Republicans the crucial question leading up to Feb. 1 — is whether Mr. Trump will abruptly end his nice-guy routine with Mr. Cruz and begin attacking him in advertisements and behind the microphone at his big, highly publicized rallies.\n\n“I’m a little concerned about that,” Representative Steve King of Iowa, Mr. Cruz’s highest-profile surrogate in the state and travel partner for part of the week, said about the possibility of a Trump offensive. “Trump is so completely unpredictable, we don’t know what he might do campaign-wise. We can’t even begin to think about anticipating that.”\n\nMr. Trump, whom Mr. Cruz praised for months, has begun to taunt the senator, raising questions about his Canadian birthplace and his faith. But he has stopped short of aggressively attacking Mr. Cruz and has run television commercials about only himself so far.\n\nMr. Cruz, responding to the birthplace slight on Tuesday, posted a video clip on Twitter from the infamous jump-the-shark episode of “Happy Days,” but has repeatedly declined to say more.\n\nOther rivals have not given Mr. Cruz a free pass: He is coming under attack from the winners of the last two Iowa caucus votes, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. Both their candidacies, which are barely registering in Iowa polls, depend on a strong result in the caucuses. But both men have little money with which to inflict damage on Mr. Cruz — and nothing like the millions that a “super PAC” supporting Mitt Romney unleashed on Newt Gingrich here in the 2012 campaign.\n\n“They’re fighting with rocks against bazookas,” Mr. Strawn said.\n\nMr. Cruz has become far more entrenched in Iowa than Mr. Gingrich was at the same point in his campaign four years ago. With many conservative activists here feeling a sense of fury toward their party, Mr. Cruz has emerged as the candidate most effectively channeling the boiling anger of Republican hard-liners.\n\nConversations with dozens of Cruz supporters suggest that the deep dismay Iowa Republicans feel toward Washington is prompting them to coalesce behind Mr. Cruz, whom they see as the only viable conservative contender.\n\n“We need a winner,” Susie Lee, 50, said Monday before Mr. Cruz made a late-night stop at a diner in Missouri Valley. “Huckabee and Santorum are great guys, but they haven’t been in office like Senator Cruz has, fighting.”\n\nPamela Oviatt of Logan, a Santorum backer four years ago, showed up before 9 p.m. for Mr. Cruz’s 10:30 p.m. appearance. She said there was little talk among activists for any of his rivals. “Cruz is the only one that’s in the political system now that anybody is looking at twice,” she said.\n\nMs. Oviatt’s distinction about being part of the political system remains a worrisome one for Mr. Cruz’s backers.\n\nIowa Republican leaders say that he is the preferred candidate among traditional activists. “He’s winning the within-the-system, anti-establishment folks,” said Don Kass, Republican chairman in Plymouth County. But the party leaders also say that Mr. Trump is garnering support from people new to the caucuses.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump’s backers here say they are confident that his attacks on the political status quo will bring out thousands of Iowans who have not previously caucused or even registered as Republicans, and his campaign is trying to register supporters as Republicans.\n\nBut state party records indicate only modest increases in the numbers of registered Republicans over recent months, a pattern little different from that in previous election years. There are now just over 612,000 registered Iowa Republicans. In early August, there were just over 609,000.\n\nThe threat Mr. Trump presents has nevertheless cast a shadow of uncertainty over the caucuses and the party. And that, in its own way, has also aided Mr. Cruz: Mark Lundberg, the Sioux County Republican chairman, said he thought Mr. Cruz was one of the few candidates running who could appeal to the angry Trump legions, should Mr. Trump fall short.\n\nMindful of this, Mr. Cruz has seldom mentioned Mr. Trump except to praise him. This week, however, he has started invoking Mr. Trump for another reason.\n\nAsked about attacks by some of his rivals, Mr. Cruz observed that Mr. Trump was the target of a similar barrage a few weeks ago. He also told diners at a steakhouse in Carroll to expect “tens of millions of dollars” in ads assailing him to be unleashed in the coming weeks — the sort of onslaught that a true underdog would never receive.\n\nHis eyes wandering to a political flier on a nearby table, Mr. Cruz seized on a bit of evidence. “I’m looking at a mailer some of y’all may have seen: ‘Ted Cruz is dangerous!’” he read.\n\n“You know what? To the Washington cartel, to the career politicians there that are getting fat and happy and want the gravy train to keep going, that’s exactly right.”","gunning_fog_1":"7.6","flesch_1":"6.4","readability_1":"74.19","index_2":"43","title_2":"Another Pro-Cruz Super PAC Launches, This One Led by Rick Perry","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/another-pro-cruz-super-pac-launches-this-one-led-by-rick-perry/","candidate_2":"Ted Cruz","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"The network of super PACs backing Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz now has a fifth member.\nThe new group, called Keep the Promise for Veterans, will be led by former Texas Gov.

To date, Mr. Sanders has raised $95 million.\nThe $20 million haul came from more than 770,000 contributions, with an average donation of $27, his campaign said. Mr. Sanders has received more than 3.25 million donations since starting his campaign, a record number.\nMr. Sanders’s rival, Hillary Clinton, has not reported how much she raised in January and is not required to do so until next month.\nMrs. Clinton was expected to have the strongest fundraising operation in the field. Indeed, she has outraised her rivals in both parties, bringing in $112 million last year. A super PAC supporting her candidacy has raised an additional $50 million.\nBut Mr. Sanders has posed a more significant fundraising threat than expected, raising within a few million dollars of what Mrs. Clinton brought in each quarter.\nMr. Sanders has the advantage over Mrs. Clinton of relying on small donations, rather than on individuals donating the maximum $2,700 for the primary. That allows his campaign to tap previous donors for more funds, rather than finding new supporters. His campaign said Sunday that just 1.3% of its fourth-quarter donations were from donors who had hit the legal maximum.\nThe campaign has not yet filed its fourth-quarter fundraising disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, nor has Mrs. Clintons.

Trump leads a familiar refrain as he details his plan to build a giant wall along the border with Mexico.\n\n“Who’s gonna pay?” he asks.\n\nWithout fail, Mr. Trump’s adoring fans reply, “Mexico!”\n\nWhile the Mexican government has said little about Mr. Trump’s plan to beef up border security, two of the country’s former presidents have a message for Mr. Trump: Mexico won’t pay.\n\n“I’m not going to pay,” Vicente Fox said, using a profanity to comment about the wall Thursday in an interview with Fusion. “He should pay for it. He’s got the money.”\n\nMr. Fox, who was president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, was clear in his opposition to Mr. Trump, calling him “egocentric” and lacking in any political values.

Although not unexpected, the nod from Abbott is the clearest sign yet that the Texas Republican establishment is backing their freshman senator in his presidential ambitions.\n\"After 8 years of relentless attacks on our values from this White House, it's our duty as Texas conservatives to support a leader we can trust to restore our values and move this country forward,\" Abbott said in a video message out Wednesday. \"That's why I'm supporting Ted Cruz for president.\" \nAbbott will also quickly become the most senior political leader to back Cruz's bid. No other governor has endorsed him, nor has any senator -- including the state's senior senator, John Cornyn.\nA year ago, who Abbott would endorse in the Republican race -- if he would at all -- was one of the hottest questions in Texas politics. But as the field winnowed and the other candidates with ties to Texas -- former Gov. Rick Perry, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina -- dropped out, it became increasingly clear that Abbott would choose Cruz, the state's rising political star.\nAbbott and Cruz share a hardline position on the governor's top national priority: strengthening the nation's border and rooting out illegal immigration. But their connection is also personal: When Abbott was the state attorney general under Perry, Cruz was Abbott's solicitor general, arguing cases on behalf of the state before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nCruz has repeatedly spoken glowingly of Abbott on the campaign trail, frequently recalling the charge that Abbott gave him -- to find constitutional fights where the Texas Attorney General could get involved, and to wage them.\nAbbott, along with dozens of state legislators and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, is expected to be a top surrogate for Cruz in the closing days of the Texas primary. Struggling to convince observers that he can do as well in the southern states on March 1 as he once hoped to, Cruz's team is raising the stakes for his performance back home, pointing to delegate-rich Texas as a place that can put him back on even footing in the delegate race with his rivals.\nBut the state is not seen as a lock: Trump has spoken of beating Cruz in Texas, and the super PAC backing Marco Rubio has invested $1.5 million in this state this week to try and embarrass Cruz by weakening him back at home.","gunning_fog_2":"10.4","flesch_2":"10.3","readability_2":"58.62","index_3":"105","title_3":"The 2016 Race: How to Understand Donald Trump’s Defeat in Iowa","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/upshot/how-to-understand-donald-trumps-defeat-in-iowa.html","candidate_3":"Donald Trump","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"For months, mainstream Republicans have hoped that Donald Trump’s support was a mirage — a combination of high name recognition, unsustainable news media coverage and support from irregular voters who might not show up in a primary.\n\nTonight, there’s reason to believe their hopes just might be well founded. Despite leading each of the last 10 Iowa polls, by an average of seven percentage points, Donald Trump was defeated by Ted Cruz, who currently leads, 28 percent to 24 percent, with 97 percent of precincts reporting in the Iowa caucuses. Marco Rubio is in a strong third place with 23 percent of the vote.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Trump came closer to taking third than to winning.\n\nThe result doesn’t necessarily leave us much closer to knowing who the eventual nominee will be. It probably signals the beginning of a protracted, three-way fight for the nomination. But the loss raises the possibility that Mr. Trump’s strength is at least partly an illusion; he may not be quite as strong as he looks.\n\nMr. Trump’s defeat won’t necessarily derail his campaign, as some have speculated. He leads by a wide margin in polling in New Hampshire, so he’ll have a strong opportunity to rebound.\n\nMr. Trump’s voters also appeared to turn out in large numbers. Many speculated that he might fail to turn out his supporters, but the turnout in Iowa was higher than most analysts had forecast, with 167,000 votes counted as of now — swamping the 122,000 votes from 2012.\n\nYet Mr. Trump still fell short. He lost among voters who decided over the last month by a wide margin, and he took third place among voters who had previously participated in the caucuses. Mr. Trump fared especially poorly among voters who decided over the last week — since his decision not to participate in the final presidential debate before the caucuses.\n\nFor Mr. Cruz, the victory gives him a chance to forge a narrow but real path to the nomination. His strengths include strong support from self-described “very conservative” voters; perhaps the best organization in the race; and a strong fund-raising apparatus. He could fare relatively well in South Carolina in a few weeks, and across the South on Super Tuesday.\n\nBut his path to the nomination is still not an easy one. He will face full-throated opposition from many prominent Republicans, as was the case here in Iowa. And Mr. Cruz’s narrow victory was not especially impressive. It depended almost exclusively on strength among “very conservative” voters, who are vastly overrepresented in the Iowa caucuses. There was no primary state where “very conservative” voters represented a larger share of the electorate in 2012 than they did in Iowa.\n\nHe won just 19 percent among “somewhat conservative” voters and a mere 9 percent of the “moderate” vote.\n\nMr. Cruz’s victory may bestow enough momentum to attract less conservative voters. But recent primary contests offer reason to be cautious about his prospects. Candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum never succeeded in broadening their appeal beyond their natural bases after winning Iowa, and Mr. Cruz will probably fall short of the nomination if he also cannot do so.\n\nMaking it even harder for Mr. Cruz to broaden his appeal is Mr. Rubio. He finished in a strong third place, beating pre-election polls and nearly beating Mr. Trump for second in a state where Mr. Cruz’s base is at its strongest.\n\nWhether Mr. Rubio’s showing will be enough to change the race in New Hampshire is hard to say — there isn’t much precedent for a logjam like the one we have in New Hampshire. Four mainstream conservative candidates — John Kasich, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and Mr. Rubio — have all been clustered near 10 percent of the vote in New Hampshire surveys.\n\nIf Mr. Rubio’s performance in Iowa bestows enough media coverage and credibility for him to break the deadlock, it would be a crucial turning point in the race. A strong Rubio showing in New Hampshire could push several mainstream candidates out, freeing up endorsements and fund-raising dollars that have sat on the sidelines. It would also allow him to consolidate the voters who have supported the mainstream candidates.\n\nIt would bring about a true three-way race heading into South Carolina.","gunning_fog_3":"8.8","flesch_3":"8.7","readability_3":"62.68","index_4":"48","title_4":"First Draft: Ted Cruz Outlines Plan to Strengthen Military","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/16/ted-cruz-outlines-plan-to-strengthen-military/","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_4":"MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas outlined his plans to strengthen the military in an address aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown on Tuesday, advocating what he called a “more tooth, less tail” approach.\n\nIn his speech on the World War II-era aircraft carrier, Mr. Cruz called for increasing the number of active duty forces to at least 1.4 million from 1.3 million, as well as improving the nation’s Air Force capabilities — to at least 6,000 planes, with a minimum of 1,500 tactical fighter aircraft, an increase from roughly 4,000 aircraft.\n\n“Anything less creates a continuing training and readiness gap that risks the lives of the men and women who volunteer to serve this great nation,” he said. “At a time when our air superiority should be one of America’s great advantages, our ability to project power and obtain air superiority is tragically anemic.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s last-minute policy speech (the campaign announced it on Monday night) highlights how, days before Saturday’s Republican primary in South Carolina, he is trying to emphasize his national security credentials in a state in which veterans and members of the military make up large segments of the population. He is also pushing back against attacks by rivals who have cast him as weak on foreign policy and national defense.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida has repeatedly attacked Mr. Cruz for refusing to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the military. And the Texas senator has also come under scrutiny for his decision to support the USA Freedom Act, compromise legislation that limited the National Security Agency’s ability to collect bulk metadata from phone records.\n\nMr. Cruz has said he voted against the defense authorization bills because they all contained language that would have allowed President Obama to indefinitely detain United States citizens without due process.\n\nThough Mr. Cruz’s positions on national security — he is less hawkish than Mr. Rubio — helped him win over some supporters of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky — who dropped out of the presidential race — in New Hampshire, voters in South Carolina have typically gravitated toward candidates eager for a strong commander in chief.\n\nIn his address, Mr. Cruz criticized both Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, a secretary of state in the Obama administration, and seemed to try to strike a balance between promising to be tough on national defense by increasing the size of the nation’s fighting force, while also promising not to be to quick to intervene in conflicts around the globe. And he promised smarter spending on defense.\n\nMr. Cruz also weighed in on other issues — what to do with Syrian refuges, immigration and women in combat.\n\n“We are not going to admit refugees into the United States who may have been infiltrated by ISIS terrorists,” he said, to applause. “We are not going to grant American citizenship to individuals who are here illegally.”\n\nAnd, he added, “As the father of two daughters, I can tell you we are not going to draft American women into military combat.”\n\nMr. Cruz did not specifically explain how he would pay for his military expansion, but pointed to his spending plan, which he said would reduce the federal budget by $500 billion over 10 years, and also talked about reducing “waste, fraud and abuse” at the Pentagon.\n\n“First, and foremost, we are not going to expand the bloated bureaucracy that is stifling progress and innovation at the Pentagon,” Mr. Cruz said.\n\nDirectly addressing his critics, Mr. Cruz said, “If you think it’s too expensive to defend this nation, try not defending it.”\n\nHe concluded by talking about the illustrious history of the U.S.S. Yorktown, and conjuring an image of a stronger America.\n\n“Starting next year, our sailors won’t be on their knees with their hands on their heads,” Mr. Cruz said, referring to the 10 Navy sailors briefly detained by Iran last month after drifting into Iranian waters. “And our secretary of state will not be apologizing and thanking their Iranian captors.”\n\n“Instead,” Mr. Cruz continued, “they will be standing on the decks of the mightiest ships the world has ever known with their heads held high, confident that the great country that they volunteered to serve has their back.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the event, Mr. Cruz couldn’t help but take aim at Donald J. Trump, his chief rival, who has threatened to sue him over his eligibility to run for president, because he was born in Canada.\n\n“It seems that Donald is very rattled right now,” Mr. Cruz said. “He gets very upset and when he gets upset, he engages in insults.”","gunning_fog_4":"9.2","flesch_4":"9.1","readability_4":"61.67","index_5":"77","title_5":"Political fallout for Clinton after North Korea's nuke test","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/politics/north-korea-nuclear-test-clinton-trump/index.html","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_5":"Washington (CNN) North Korea might not be able to reach the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon yet, but the political fallout from its claimed hydrogen bomb test is here already.\nEven before the shockwaves of the 5.1 temblor triggered by Tuesday's test wore off, Hillary Clinton was fighting off a volley of Republican attacks, GOP presidential candidates were talking tough and Donald Trump jumped on a chance to chastise China.\nThe episode was a fresh indication of the challenge that Clinton faces in running for the White House on her record as secretary of state, which makes it impossible for her to escape deficiencies in President Barack Obama's national security legacy.\n\"If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy,\" crowed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is styling himself as a foreign policy expert. He argued that U.S. enemies were \"taking advantage of Obama's weakness.\"\nFormer business executive Carly Fiorina, another outspoken GOP hawk, also slammed Clinton, arguing that the volatile Stalinist state had been spurred to up the nuclear ante by Obama administration concessions granted to Iran in return for a freezing of its nuclear program.\n\"Of course, North Korea would conduct a nuclear test after watching Iran willfully violate an agreement they just made without consequence of any kind from this administration,\" Fiorina said in a statement. \"North Korea is yet another Hillary Clinton foreign policy failure.\"\n\nThere's no question that as the administration in possession of the North Korea nuclear problem, the Obama White House -- and by extension Clinton -- are in a political bind.\nTheir failure to turn back North Korea's development of its nuclear arsenal is manifest in its flurry of nuclear tests and ballistic missile engineering over the last seven years. But there is no obvious way to deter a nation that does not respond to the traditional carrots and sticks of diplomacy.\n\"What we've also seen on the part of North Koreans is an apparent willingness to accept international isolation,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday, pointing out that North Korea already had a nuclear bomb when Obama took office.\nClinton's campaign is working to absolve her of blame for past failures and to turn her vulnerability into a strength. So the former secretary of state offered the most detailed plan of any of the candidates on how to respond.\nAddressing multiple audiences, as a commander-in-chief must, Clinton accused North Korea of playing nuclear blackmail and \"bullying,\" offered reassurance to U.S. allies and then turned on her Republican foes, questioning their capacity to handle the situation.\nThe former top U.S. diplomat also defended her own work on North Korea, saying she had been responsible for getting Russia and China on board for the \"strongest sanctions yet\" against Pyongyang while she was at the State Department.\nAnd she fired a warning at her Republican adversaries, particularly seeming to target the brazen Trump and youthful Rubio.\n\"Threats like this are yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election. We cannot afford reckless, imprudent publicity stunts that risk war. We need a commander-in-chief with the experience and judgement to deal with a dangerous North Korea on Day One.\"\n\nRepublican front-runner Trump also tried to turn the North Korea explosion to his own political advantage, further increasing the heat on China after his accusations of fleecing the United States on economic issues.\n\"China has total control, believe me, they say they don't. They have total control over North Korea and China should solve that problem,\" Trump said on Fox News.\nHe continued, \"If they don't solve the problem, we should make trade very difficult for China because we are, believe it, we are holding China up. They're taking so much money. They're draining our country, and they're toying with us with North Korea.\"\nBut while China might be the key player in North Korea, the Obama and George W. Bush administrations repeatedly pressed Beijing to rein in its de-facto ally but did not shift the underlying dynamics of the standoff.\n \nIn recent years there have been signs of increasing impatience from Beijing toward Pyongyang, but China's concerns on the issue have not changed -- namely a reluctance to seeing a unified Korean peninsula allied with the United States and a potentially destabilizing flow of millions of refugees into its territory should the regime collapse.\nRubio pressed home his attack on Wednesday in Iowa, offering his own plan. He called on North Korea to be put back on the list of state-sponsors of terrorism, for new sanctions on its leaders, a hike in U.S. military spending and reinvigorated alliances with U.S. Asian allies and a renewed commitment to missile defense.\n\"If trends continue, this lunatic will possess a missile and a warhead capable of reaching the U.S., and we better be capable of shooting it down before it gets anywhere near us,\" he warned. \"We need to invest and re-commit to that again.\"\nAnother GOP candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, used the nuclear test to argue that bad things happen when America has \"withdrawn\" from the world.\n\nHowever, so intractable has the North Korea problem been that it seemed doubtful that any of the approaches outlined by potential next presidents would work. As is often the case when foreign policy mixes with campaign politics, it can prove easier for candidates to grandstand than frame grand strategy.\nWashington has tried punishment and inducements repeatedly with North Korea and has failed to change the calculations of a secretive, repressive regime that uses its pariah status to entrench its power at home and is prepared to let its own people starve rather than offer concessions to Washington.\nBush, for instance, came to office and ended Bill Clinton's policy of engaging the Pyongyang regime. He then toughened his stance by including North Korea in his \"axis of evil.\"\n \nBut the strategy failed as North Korea restarted plutonium reactors frozen under a 1994 deal with the Clinton administration, while the administration accused it of building a separate uranium program. Pyongyang ultimately conducted a nuclear test in 2006.\nBy the end of his administration, Bush saw six-party international talks with the North Koreans as the best way to defuse the nuclear standoff.\nObama has also tried the hardline approach. \nIn 2010, during a visit to Seoul, he addressed the leaders of North Korea directly, warning that their pursuit of nuclear arms denied them dignity and would only lead to more of the same: \"more broken dreams, more isolation.\"\nAnd he's used diplomacy, but with no better results. During his time in office, Pyongyang has conducted at least three nuclear tests and a flurry of missile and satellite launches. And unless something dramatic changes, he will bequeath the North Korean nuclear headache to the next president.","gunning_fog_5":"9.6","flesch_5":"10.7","readability_5":"52.19","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton Is Fundamentally Honest and Trustworthy","gold_url":"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/hillary-clinton-fundamentally-honest-and-trustworthy","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"Mother Jones","gold_body":"As we all know, millennials don't care much for Hillary Clinton. That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.645833333333333,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-07T23:21:01+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952830842,"created_at":"2016-04-07T23:14:35+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T23:13:11+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"GA","city":"Atlanta","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915116,"worker_id":36603404,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.93184375,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"0","g2":"0","q1":"1","q2":"1","q3":"1","q4":"2","q5":"-1","q6":"-1","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"0","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"no_affiliation","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"ted_cruz"},"unit_data":{"nil":"10","index_1":"52","title_1":"Cruz failed to disclose Goldman loan during Senate run","url_1":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/WsD1UYfsiQY/cruz-failed-to-disclose-goldman-loan-during-senate-run.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"Fox News","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz failed to disclose on federal fundraising reports that he relied on $1 million in loans to help finance his 2012 Senate campaign.\nThe borrowed money included a sum from Goldman Sachs, where his wife, Heidi Cruz, is an employee.\nThe Texas senator's 2016 campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier called the failure to report those loans on fundraising documents, as required, a \"mistake.\" She said Wednesday that the campaign is seeking guidance from federal regulators on how to update the old reports.\nCruz learned he should have disclosed the loans as part of his fundraising from a New York Times reporter, who published a story on the matter late Wednesday.

Despite leading each of the last 10 Iowa polls, by an average of seven percentage points, Donald Trump was defeated by Ted Cruz, who currently leads, 28 percent to 24 percent, with 97 percent of precincts reporting in the Iowa caucuses. Marco Rubio is in a strong third place with 23 percent of the vote.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Trump came closer to taking third than to winning.\n\nThe result doesn’t necessarily leave us much closer to knowing who the eventual nominee will be. It probably signals the beginning of a protracted, three-way fight for the nomination. But the loss raises the possibility that Mr. Trump’s strength is at least partly an illusion; he may not be quite as strong as he looks.\n\nMr. Trump’s defeat won’t necessarily derail his campaign, as some have speculated. He leads by a wide margin in polling in New Hampshire, so he’ll have a strong opportunity to rebound.\n\nMr. Trump’s voters also appeared to turn out in large numbers. Many speculated that he might fail to turn out his supporters, but the turnout in Iowa was higher than most analysts had forecast, with 167,000 votes counted as of now — swamping the 122,000 votes from 2012.\n\nYet Mr. Trump still fell short. He lost among voters who decided over the last month by a wide margin, and he took third place among voters who had previously participated in the caucuses. Mr. Trump fared especially poorly among voters who decided over the last week — since his decision not to participate in the final presidential debate before the caucuses.\n\nFor Mr. Cruz, the victory gives him a chance to forge a narrow but real path to the nomination. His strengths include strong support from self-described “very conservative” voters; perhaps the best organization in the race; and a strong fund-raising apparatus. He could fare relatively well in South Carolina in a few weeks, and across the South on Super Tuesday.\n\nBut his path to the nomination is still not an easy one. He will face full-throated opposition from many prominent Republicans, as was the case here in Iowa. And Mr. Cruz’s narrow victory was not especially impressive. It depended almost exclusively on strength among “very conservative” voters, who are vastly overrepresented in the Iowa caucuses. There was no primary state where “very conservative” voters represented a larger share of the electorate in 2012 than they did in Iowa.\n\nHe won just 19 percent among “somewhat conservative” voters and a mere 9 percent of the “moderate” vote.\n\nMr. Cruz’s victory may bestow enough momentum to attract less conservative voters. But recent primary contests offer reason to be cautious about his prospects. Candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum never succeeded in broadening their appeal beyond their natural bases after winning Iowa, and Mr. Cruz will probably fall short of the nomination if he also cannot do so.\n\nMaking it even harder for Mr. Cruz to broaden his appeal is Mr. Rubio. He finished in a strong third place, beating pre-election polls and nearly beating Mr. Trump for second in a state where Mr. Cruz’s base is at its strongest.\n\nWhether Mr. Rubio’s showing will be enough to change the race in New Hampshire is hard to say — there isn’t much precedent for a logjam like the one we have in New Hampshire.

A strong Rubio showing in New Hampshire could push several mainstream candidates out, freeing up endorsements and fund-raising dollars that have sat on the sidelines. It would also allow him to consolidate the voters who have supported the mainstream candidates.\n\nIt would bring about a true three-way race heading into South Carolina.","gunning_fog_3":"8.8","flesch_3":"8.7","readability_3":"62.68","index_4":"48","title_4":"First Draft: Ted Cruz Outlines Plan to Strengthen Military","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/16/ted-cruz-outlines-plan-to-strengthen-military/","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_4":"MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas outlined his plans to strengthen the military in an address aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown on Tuesday, advocating what he called a “more tooth, less tail” approach.\n\nIn his speech on the World War II-era aircraft carrier, Mr. Cruz called for increasing the number of active duty forces to at least 1.4 million from 1.3 million, as well as improving the nation’s Air Force capabilities — to at least 6,000 planes, with a minimum of 1,500 tactical fighter aircraft, an increase from roughly 4,000 aircraft.\n\n“Anything less creates a continuing training and readiness gap that risks the lives of the men and women who volunteer to serve this great nation,” he said. “At a time when our air superiority should be one of America’s great advantages, our ability to project power and obtain air superiority is tragically anemic.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s last-minute policy speech (the campaign announced it on Monday night) highlights how, days before Saturday’s Republican primary in South Carolina, he is trying to emphasize his national security credentials in a state in which veterans and members of the military make up large segments of the population. He is also pushing back against attacks by rivals who have cast him as weak on foreign policy and national defense.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida has repeatedly attacked Mr. Cruz for refusing to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the military. And the Texas senator has also come under scrutiny for his decision to support the USA Freedom Act, compromise legislation that limited the National Security Agency’s ability to collect bulk metadata from phone records.\n\nMr. Cruz has said he voted against the defense authorization bills because they all contained language that would have allowed President Obama to indefinitely detain United States citizens without due process.\n\nThough Mr. Cruz’s positions on national security — he is less hawkish than Mr. Rubio — helped him win over some supporters of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky — who dropped out of the presidential race — in New Hampshire, voters in South Carolina have typically gravitated toward candidates eager for a strong commander in chief.\n\nIn his address, Mr. Cruz criticized both Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, a secretary of state in the Obama administration, and seemed to try to strike a balance between promising to be tough on national defense by increasing the size of the nation’s fighting force, while also promising not to be to quick to intervene in conflicts around the globe. And he promised smarter spending on defense.\n\nMr. Cruz also weighed in on other issues — what to do with Syrian refuges, immigration and women in combat.\n\n“We are not going to admit refugees into the United States who may have been infiltrated by ISIS terrorists,” he said, to applause. “We are not going to grant American citizenship to individuals who are here illegally.”\n\nAnd, he added, “As the father of two daughters, I can tell you we are not going to draft American women into military combat.”\n\nMr. Cruz did not specifically explain how he would pay for his military expansion, but pointed to his spending plan, which he said would reduce the federal budget by $500 billion over 10 years, and also talked about reducing “waste, fraud and abuse” at the Pentagon.\n\n“First, and foremost, we are not going to expand the bloated bureaucracy that is stifling progress and innovation at the Pentagon,” Mr. Cruz said.\n\nDirectly addressing his critics, Mr. Cruz said, “If you think it’s too expensive to defend this nation, try not defending it.”\n\nHe concluded by talking about the illustrious history of the U.S.S. Yorktown, and conjuring an image of a stronger America.\n\n“Starting next year, our sailors won’t be on their knees with their hands on their heads,” Mr. Cruz said, referring to the 10 Navy sailors briefly detained by Iran last month after drifting into Iranian waters. “And our secretary of state will not be apologizing and thanking their Iranian captors.”\n\n“Instead,” Mr. Cruz continued, “they will be standing on the decks of the mightiest ships the world has ever known with their heads held high, confident that the great country that they volunteered to serve has their back.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the event, Mr. Cruz couldn’t help but take aim at Donald J. Trump, his chief rival, who has threatened to sue him over his eligibility to run for president, because he was born in Canada.\n\n“It seems that Donald is very rattled right now,” Mr. Cruz said. “He gets very upset and when he gets upset, he engages in insults.”","gunning_fog_4":"9.2","flesch_4":"9.1","readability_4":"61.67","index_5":"77","title_5":"Political fallout for Clinton after North Korea's nuke test","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/politics/north-korea-nuclear-test-clinton-trump/index.html","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_5":"Washington (CNN) North Korea might not be able to reach the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon yet, but the political fallout from its claimed hydrogen bomb test is here already.\nEven before the shockwaves of the 5.1 temblor triggered by Tuesday's test wore off, Hillary Clinton was fighting off a volley of Republican attacks, GOP presidential candidates were talking tough and Donald Trump jumped on a chance to chastise China.\nThe episode was a fresh indication of the challenge that Clinton faces in running for the White House on her record as secretary of state, which makes it impossible for her to escape deficiencies in President Barack Obama's national security legacy.\n\"If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy,\" crowed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is styling himself as a foreign policy expert. He argued that U.S. enemies were \"taking advantage of Obama's weakness.\"\nFormer business executive Carly Fiorina, another outspoken GOP hawk, also slammed Clinton, arguing that the volatile Stalinist state had been spurred to up the nuclear ante by Obama administration concessions granted to Iran in return for a freezing of its nuclear program.\n\"Of course, North Korea would conduct a nuclear test after watching Iran willfully violate an agreement they just made without consequence of any kind from this administration,\" Fiorina said in a statement. \"North Korea is yet another Hillary Clinton foreign policy failure.\"\n\nThere's no question that as the administration in possession of the North Korea nuclear problem, the Obama White House -- and by extension Clinton -- are in a political bind.\nTheir failure to turn back North Korea's development of its nuclear arsenal is manifest in its flurry of nuclear tests and ballistic missile engineering over the last seven years. But there is no obvious way to deter a nation that does not respond to the traditional carrots and sticks of diplomacy.\n\"What we've also seen on the part of North Koreans is an apparent willingness to accept international isolation,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday, pointing out that North Korea already had a nuclear bomb when Obama took office.\nClinton's campaign is working to absolve her of blame for past failures and to turn her vulnerability into a strength. So the former secretary of state offered the most detailed plan of any of the candidates on how to respond.\nAddressing multiple audiences, as a commander-in-chief must, Clinton accused North Korea of playing nuclear blackmail and \"bullying,\" offered reassurance to U.S. allies and then turned on her Republican foes, questioning their capacity to handle the situation.\nThe former top U.S. diplomat also defended her own work on North Korea, saying she had been responsible for getting Russia and China on board for the \"strongest sanctions yet\" against Pyongyang while she was at the State Department.\nAnd she fired a warning at her Republican adversaries, particularly seeming to target the brazen Trump and youthful Rubio.\n\"Threats like this are yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election. We cannot afford reckless, imprudent publicity stunts that risk war. We need a commander-in-chief with the experience and judgement to deal with a dangerous North Korea on Day One.\"\n\nRepublican front-runner Trump also tried to turn the North Korea explosion to his own political advantage, further increasing the heat on China after his accusations of fleecing the United States on economic issues.\n\"China has total control, believe me, they say they don't. They have total control over North Korea and China should solve that problem,\" Trump said on Fox News.\nHe continued, \"If they don't solve the problem, we should make trade very difficult for China because we are, believe it, we are holding China up. They're taking so much money. They're draining our country, and they're toying with us with North Korea.\"\nBut while China might be the key player in North Korea, the Obama and George W. Bush administrations repeatedly pressed Beijing to rein in its de-facto ally but did not shift the underlying dynamics of the standoff.\n \nIn recent years there have been signs of increasing impatience from Beijing toward Pyongyang, but China's concerns on the issue have not changed -- namely a reluctance to seeing a unified Korean peninsula allied with the United States and a potentially destabilizing flow of millions of refugees into its territory should the regime collapse.\nRubio pressed home his attack on Wednesday in Iowa, offering his own plan. He called on North Korea to be put back on the list of state-sponsors of terrorism, for new sanctions on its leaders, a hike in U.S. military spending and reinvigorated alliances with U.S. Asian allies and a renewed commitment to missile defense.\n\"If trends continue, this lunatic will possess a missile and a warhead capable of reaching the U.S., and we better be capable of shooting it down before it gets anywhere near us,\" he warned. \"We need to invest and re-commit to that again.\"\nAnother GOP candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, used the nuclear test to argue that bad things happen when America has \"withdrawn\" from the world.\n\nHowever, so intractable has the North Korea problem been that it seemed doubtful that any of the approaches outlined by potential next presidents would work. As is often the case when foreign policy mixes with campaign politics, it can prove easier for candidates to grandstand than frame grand strategy.\nWashington has tried punishment and inducements repeatedly with North Korea and has failed to change the calculations of a secretive, repressive regime that uses its pariah status to entrench its power at home and is prepared to let its own people starve rather than offer concessions to Washington.\nBush, for instance, came to office and ended Bill Clinton's policy of engaging the Pyongyang regime. He then toughened his stance by including North Korea in his \"axis of evil.\"\n \nBut the strategy failed as North Korea restarted plutonium reactors frozen under a 1994 deal with the Clinton administration, while the administration accused it of building a separate uranium program. Pyongyang ultimately conducted a nuclear test in 2006.\nBy the end of his administration, Bush saw six-party international talks with the North Koreans as the best way to defuse the nuclear standoff.\nObama has also tried the hardline approach. \nIn 2010, during a visit to Seoul, he addressed the leaders of North Korea directly, warning that their pursuit of nuclear arms denied them dignity and would only lead to more of the same: \"more broken dreams, more isolation.\"\nAnd he's used diplomacy, but with no better results. During his time in office, Pyongyang has conducted at least three nuclear tests and a flurry of missile and satellite launches. And unless something dramatic changes, he will bequeath the North Korean nuclear headache to the next president.","gunning_fog_5":"9.6","flesch_5":"10.7","readability_5":"52.19","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton Is Fundamentally Honest and Trustworthy","gold_url":"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/hillary-clinton-fundamentally-honest-and-trustworthy","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"Mother Jones","gold_body":"As we all know, millennials don't care much for Hillary Clinton. That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}},{"id":1952832668,"created_at":"2016-04-07T23:17:16+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T23:12:12+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"tremorgames","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NY","city":"Utica","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915116,"worker_id":32916723,"trust":0.6875,"worker_trust":0.949107142857143,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"-1","q2":"0","q3":"1","q4":"0","q5":"-1","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"1","q9":"0","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"might_not_vote"},"unit_data":{"nil":"10","index_1":"52","title_1":"Cruz failed to disclose Goldman loan during Senate run","url_1":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/WsD1UYfsiQY/cruz-failed-to-disclose-goldman-loan-during-senate-run.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"Fox News","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz failed to disclose on federal fundraising reports that he relied on $1 million in loans to help finance his 2012 Senate campaign.\nThe borrowed money included a sum from Goldman Sachs, where his wife, Heidi Cruz, is an employee.\nThe Texas senator's 2016 campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier called the failure to report those loans on fundraising documents, as required, a \"mistake.\" She said Wednesday that the campaign is seeking guidance from federal regulators on how to update the old reports.\nCruz learned he should have disclosed the loans as part of his fundraising from a New York Times reporter, who published a story on the matter late Wednesday.

But there is no obvious way to deter a nation that does not respond to the traditional carrots and sticks of diplomacy.\n\"What we've also seen on the part of North Koreans is an apparent willingness to accept international isolation,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday, pointing out that North Korea already had a nuclear bomb when Obama took office.\nClinton's campaign is working to absolve her of blame for past failures and to turn her vulnerability into a strength. So the former secretary of state offered the most detailed plan of any of the candidates on how to respond.\nAddressing multiple audiences, as a commander-in-chief must, Clinton accused North Korea of playing nuclear blackmail and \"bullying,\" offered reassurance to U.S. allies and then turned on her Republican foes, questioning their capacity to handle the situation.\nThe former top U.S. diplomat also defended her own work on North Korea, saying she had been responsible for getting Russia and China on board for the \"strongest sanctions yet\" against Pyongyang while she was at the State Department.\nAnd she fired a warning at her Republican adversaries, particularly seeming to target the brazen Trump and youthful Rubio.\n\"Threats like this are yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election. We cannot afford reckless, imprudent publicity stunts that risk war. We need a commander-in-chief with the experience and judgement to deal with a dangerous North Korea on Day One.\"\n\nRepublican front-runner Trump also tried to turn the North Korea explosion to his own political advantage, further increasing the heat on China after his accusations of fleecing the United States on economic issues.\n\"China has total control, believe me, they say they don't. They have total control over North Korea and China should solve that problem,\" Trump said on Fox News.\nHe continued, \"If they don't solve the problem, we should make trade very difficult for China because we are, believe it, we are holding China up. They're taking so much money. They're draining our country, and they're toying with us with North Korea.\"\nBut while China might be the key player in North Korea, the Obama and George W. Bush administrations repeatedly pressed Beijing to rein in its de-facto ally but did not shift the underlying dynamics of the standoff.\n \nIn recent years there have been signs of increasing impatience from Beijing toward Pyongyang, but China's concerns on the issue have not changed -- namely a reluctance to seeing a unified Korean peninsula allied with the United States and a potentially destabilizing flow of millions of refugees into its territory should the regime collapse.\nRubio pressed home his attack on Wednesday in Iowa, offering his own plan. He called on North Korea to be put back on the list of state-sponsors of terrorism, for new sanctions on its leaders, a hike in U.S. military spending and reinvigorated alliances with U.S. Asian allies and a renewed commitment to missile defense.\n\"If trends continue, this lunatic will possess a missile and a warhead capable of reaching the U.S., and we better be capable of shooting it down before it gets anywhere near us,\" he warned. \"We need to invest and re-commit to that again.\"\nAnother GOP candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, used the nuclear test to argue that bad things happen when America has \"withdrawn\" from the world.\n\nHowever, so intractable has the North Korea problem been that it seemed doubtful that any of the approaches outlined by potential next presidents would work. As is often the case when foreign policy mixes with campaign politics, it can prove easier for candidates to grandstand than frame grand strategy.\nWashington has tried punishment and inducements repeatedly with North Korea and has failed to change the calculations of a secretive, repressive regime that uses its pariah status to entrench its power at home and is prepared to let its own people starve rather than offer concessions to Washington.\nBush, for instance, came to office and ended Bill Clinton's policy of engaging the Pyongyang regime. He then toughened his stance by including North Korea in his \"axis of evil.\"\n \nBut the strategy failed as North Korea restarted plutonium reactors frozen under a 1994 deal with the Clinton administration, while the administration accused it of building a separate uranium program. Pyongyang ultimately conducted a nuclear test in 2006.\nBy the end of his administration, Bush saw six-party international talks with the North Koreans as the best way to defuse the nuclear standoff.\nObama has also tried the hardline approach. \nIn 2010, during a visit to Seoul, he addressed the leaders of North Korea directly, warning that their pursuit of nuclear arms denied them dignity and would only lead to more of the same: \"more broken dreams, more isolation.\"\nAnd he's used diplomacy, but with no better results. During his time in office, Pyongyang has conducted at least three nuclear tests and a flurry of missile and satellite launches. And unless something dramatic changes, he will bequeath the North Korean nuclear headache to the next president.","gunning_fog_5":"9.6","flesch_5":"10.7","readability_5":"52.19","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton Is Fundamentally Honest and Trustworthy","gold_url":"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/hillary-clinton-fundamentally-honest-and-trustworthy","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"Mother Jones","gold_body":"As we all know, millennials don't care much for Hillary Clinton. That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}},{"id":1952835435,"created_at":"2016-04-07T23:20:47+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T23:10:14+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"clixsense","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NJ","city":"Mount Laurel","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915116,"worker_id":24170547,"trust":0.5625,"worker_trust":0.82875,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"1","q2":"1","q3":"1","q4":"0","q5":"-1","q6":"0","q7":"1","q8":"0","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"64","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"donald_trump"},"unit_data":{"nil":"10","index_1":"52","title_1":"Cruz failed to disclose Goldman loan during Senate run","url_1":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/WsD1UYfsiQY/cruz-failed-to-disclose-goldman-loan-during-senate-run.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"Fox News","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz failed to disclose on federal fundraising reports that he relied on $1 million in loans to help finance his 2012 Senate campaign.\nThe borrowed money included a sum from Goldman Sachs, where his wife, Heidi Cruz, is an employee.\nThe Texas senator's 2016 campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier called the failure to report those loans on fundraising documents, as required, a \"mistake.\" She said Wednesday that the campaign is seeking guidance from federal regulators on how to update the old reports.\nCruz learned he should have disclosed the loans as part of his fundraising from a New York Times reporter, who published a story on the matter late Wednesday.

Although not unexpected, the nod from Abbott is the clearest sign yet that the Texas Republican establishment is backing their freshman senator in his presidential ambitions.\n\"After 8 years of relentless attacks on our values from this White House, it's our duty as Texas conservatives to support a leader we can trust to restore our values and move this country forward,\" Abbott said in a video message out Wednesday. \"That's why I'm supporting Ted Cruz for president.\" \nAbbott will also quickly become the most senior political leader to back Cruz's bid. No other governor has endorsed him, nor has any senator -- including the state's senior senator, John Cornyn.\nA year ago, who Abbott would endorse in the Republican race -- if he would at all -- was one of the hottest questions in Texas politics. But as the field winnowed and the other candidates with ties to Texas -- former Gov. Rick Perry, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina -- dropped out, it became increasingly clear that Abbott would choose Cruz, the state's rising political star.\nAbbott and Cruz share a hardline position on the governor's top national priority: strengthening the nation's border and rooting out illegal immigration. But their connection is also personal: When Abbott was the state attorney general under Perry, Cruz was Abbott's solicitor general, arguing cases on behalf of the state before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nCruz has repeatedly spoken glowingly of Abbott on the campaign trail, frequently recalling the charge that Abbott gave him -- to find constitutional fights where the Texas Attorney General could get involved, and to wage them.\nAbbott, along with dozens of state legislators and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, is expected to be a top surrogate for Cruz in the closing days of the Texas primary. Struggling to convince observers that he can do as well in the southern states on March 1 as he once hoped to, Cruz's team is raising the stakes for his performance back home, pointing to delegate-rich Texas as a place that can put him back on even footing in the delegate race with his rivals.\nBut the state is not seen as a lock: Trump has spoken of beating Cruz in Texas, and the super PAC backing Marco Rubio has invested $1.5 million in this state this week to try and embarrass Cruz by weakening him back at home.","gunning_fog_2":"10.4","flesch_2":"10.3","readability_2":"58.62","index_3":"105","title_3":"The 2016 Race: How to Understand Donald Trump’s Defeat in Iowa","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/upshot/how-to-understand-donald-trumps-defeat-in-iowa.html","candidate_3":"Donald Trump","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"For months, mainstream Republicans have hoped that Donald Trump’s support was a mirage — a combination of high name recognition, unsustainable news media coverage and support from irregular voters who might not show up in a primary.\n\nTonight, there’s reason to believe their hopes just might be well founded. Despite leading each of the last 10 Iowa polls, by an average of seven percentage points, Donald Trump was defeated by Ted Cruz, who currently leads, 28 percent to 24 percent, with 97 percent of precincts reporting in the Iowa caucuses. Marco Rubio is in a strong third place with 23 percent of the vote.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Trump came closer to taking third than to winning.\n\nThe result doesn’t necessarily leave us much closer to knowing who the eventual nominee will be. It probably signals the beginning of a protracted, three-way fight for the nomination. But the loss raises the possibility that Mr. Trump’s strength is at least partly an illusion; he may not be quite as strong as he looks.\n\nMr. Trump’s defeat won’t necessarily derail his campaign, as some have speculated. He leads by a wide margin in polling in New Hampshire, so he’ll have a strong opportunity to rebound.\n\nMr. Trump’s voters also appeared to turn out in large numbers. Many speculated that he might fail to turn out his supporters, but the turnout in Iowa was higher than most analysts had forecast, with 167,000 votes counted as of now — swamping the 122,000 votes from 2012.\n\nYet Mr. Trump still fell short. He lost among voters who decided over the last month by a wide margin, and he took third place among voters who had previously participated in the caucuses. Mr. Trump fared especially poorly among voters who decided over the last week — since his decision not to participate in the final presidential debate before the caucuses.\n\nFor Mr. Cruz, the victory gives him a chance to forge a narrow but real path to the nomination. His strengths include strong support from self-described “very conservative” voters; perhaps the best organization in the race; and a strong fund-raising apparatus. He could fare relatively well in South Carolina in a few weeks, and across the South on Super Tuesday.\n\nBut his path to the nomination is still not an easy one. He will face full-throated opposition from many prominent Republicans, as was the case here in Iowa. And Mr. Cruz’s narrow victory was not especially impressive. It depended almost exclusively on strength among “very conservative” voters, who are vastly overrepresented in the Iowa caucuses. There was no primary state where “very conservative” voters represented a larger share of the electorate in 2012 than they did in Iowa.\n\nHe won just 19 percent among “somewhat conservative” voters and a mere 9 percent of the “moderate” vote.\n\nMr. Cruz’s victory may bestow enough momentum to attract less conservative voters. But recent primary contests offer reason to be cautious about his prospects. Candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum never succeeded in broadening their appeal beyond their natural bases after winning Iowa, and Mr. Cruz will probably fall short of the nomination if he also cannot do so.\n\nMaking it even harder for Mr. Cruz to broaden his appeal is Mr. Rubio. He finished in a strong third place, beating pre-election polls and nearly beating Mr. Trump for second in a state where Mr. Cruz’s base is at its strongest.\n\nWhether Mr. Rubio’s showing will be enough to change the race in New Hampshire is hard to say — there isn’t much precedent for a logjam like the one we have in New Hampshire. Four mainstream conservative candidates — John Kasich, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and Mr. Rubio — have all been clustered near 10 percent of the vote in New Hampshire surveys.\n\nIf Mr. Rubio’s performance in Iowa bestows enough media coverage and credibility for him to break the deadlock, it would be a crucial turning point in the race. A strong Rubio showing in New Hampshire could push several mainstream candidates out, freeing up endorsements and fund-raising dollars that have sat on the sidelines. It would also allow him to consolidate the voters who have supported the mainstream candidates.\n\nIt would bring about a true three-way race heading into South Carolina.","gunning_fog_3":"8.8","flesch_3":"8.7","readability_3":"62.68","index_4":"48","title_4":"First Draft: Ted Cruz Outlines Plan to Strengthen Military","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/16/ted-cruz-outlines-plan-to-strengthen-military/","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_4":"MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas outlined his plans to strengthen the military in an address aboard the U.S.S.

But there is no obvious way to deter a nation that does not respond to the traditional carrots and sticks of diplomacy.\n\"What we've also seen on the part of North Koreans is an apparent willingness to accept international isolation,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday, pointing out that North Korea already had a nuclear bomb when Obama took office.\nClinton's campaign is working to absolve her of blame for past failures and to turn her vulnerability into a strength. So the former secretary of state offered the most detailed plan of any of the candidates on how to respond.\nAddressing multiple audiences, as a commander-in-chief must, Clinton accused North Korea of playing nuclear blackmail and \"bullying,\" offered reassurance to U.S. allies and then turned on her Republican foes, questioning their capacity to handle the situation.\nThe former top U.S. diplomat also defended her own work on North Korea, saying she had been responsible for getting Russia and China on board for the \"strongest sanctions yet\" against Pyongyang while she was at the State Department.\nAnd she fired a warning at her Republican adversaries, particularly seeming to target the brazen Trump and youthful Rubio.\n\"Threats like this are yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election. We cannot afford reckless, imprudent publicity stunts that risk war. We need a commander-in-chief with the experience and judgement to deal with a dangerous North Korea on Day One.\"\n\nRepublican front-runner Trump also tried to turn the North Korea explosion to his own political advantage, further increasing the heat on China after his accusations of fleecing the United States on economic issues.\n\"China has total control, believe me, they say they don't. They have total control over North Korea and China should solve that problem,\" Trump said on Fox News.\nHe continued, \"If they don't solve the problem, we should make trade very difficult for China because we are, believe it, we are holding China up. They're taking so much money. They're draining our country, and they're toying with us with North Korea.\"\nBut while China might be the key player in North Korea, the Obama and George W. Bush administrations repeatedly pressed Beijing to rein in its de-facto ally but did not shift the underlying dynamics of the standoff.\n \nIn recent years there have been signs of increasing impatience from Beijing toward Pyongyang, but China's concerns on the issue have not changed -- namely a reluctance to seeing a unified Korean peninsula allied with the United States and a potentially destabilizing flow of millions of refugees into its territory should the regime collapse.\nRubio pressed home his attack on Wednesday in Iowa, offering his own plan. He called on North Korea to be put back on the list of state-sponsors of terrorism, for new sanctions on its leaders, a hike in U.S. military spending and reinvigorated alliances with U.S. Asian allies and a renewed commitment to missile defense.\n\"If trends continue, this lunatic will possess a missile and a warhead capable of reaching the U.S., and we better be capable of shooting it down before it gets anywhere near us,\" he warned. \"We need to invest and re-commit to that again.\"\nAnother GOP candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, used the nuclear test to argue that bad things happen when America has \"withdrawn\" from the world.\n\nHowever, so intractable has the North Korea problem been that it seemed doubtful that any of the approaches outlined by potential next presidents would work. As is often the case when foreign policy mixes with campaign politics, it can prove easier for candidates to grandstand than frame grand strategy.\nWashington has tried punishment and inducements repeatedly with North Korea and has failed to change the calculations of a secretive, repressive regime that uses its pariah status to entrench its power at home and is prepared to let its own people starve rather than offer concessions to Washington.\nBush, for instance, came to office and ended Bill Clinton's policy of engaging the Pyongyang regime. He then toughened his stance by including North Korea in his \"axis of evil.\"\n \nBut the strategy failed as North Korea restarted plutonium reactors frozen under a 1994 deal with the Clinton administration, while the administration accused it of building a separate uranium program. Pyongyang ultimately conducted a nuclear test in 2006.\nBy the end of his administration, Bush saw six-party international talks with the North Koreans as the best way to defuse the nuclear standoff.\nObama has also tried the hardline approach. \nIn 2010, during a visit to Seoul, he addressed the leaders of North Korea directly, warning that their pursuit of nuclear arms denied them dignity and would only lead to more of the same: \"more broken dreams, more isolation.\"\nAnd he's used diplomacy, but with no better results. During his time in office, Pyongyang has conducted at least three nuclear tests and a flurry of missile and satellite launches. And unless something dramatic changes, he will bequeath the North Korean nuclear headache to the next president.","gunning_fog_5":"9.6","flesch_5":"10.7","readability_5":"52.19","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton Is Fundamentally Honest and Trustworthy","gold_url":"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/hillary-clinton-fundamentally-honest-and-trustworthy","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"Mother Jones","gold_body":"As we all know, millennials don't care much for Hillary Clinton. That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5555555555555556},"g2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.6944444444444444},"q1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6944444444444444},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6944444444444444},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q4":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5555555555555556},"q5":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q6":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.4444444444444444},"q7":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5555555555555556},"q8":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.75},"q9":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.75},"q10":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.75},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":0.6944444444444444},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"3049","confidence":0.75},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"no_affiliation","confidence":0.4444444444444444},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"ted_cruz","confidence":0.4444444444444444}}}

But online, the reaction was much different.\nPlayed in short video clips online or quoted in tweets, the quote almost sounded like a threat to other women: help Hillary Clinton or else.\nSome on social media asked if they should also be helping the other woman in the 2016 race, former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina. Others expressed surprise at the idea that a women should be forced to vote for a woman — instead of being free to chose based on issues. And some on Twitter took it a step further, with references to Bill Clinton’s history with women during his time in the White House.\n@madeleine I’m a good woman!

It’s from a speech she gave in 2006 as a keynote speaker. As backlash spread, Jesse Lehrich, Mrs. Clinton’s rapid response director, tweeted “peeps freaking out about that Madeleine Albright quote: It’s not new — it was literally on a Starbucks cup.”\nNick Merrill, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, pointed out on Twitter that Ms. Albright had said this “literally hundreds of times.”\nWith only three days remaining until New Hampshires primary, Mrs. Clinton deployed some of her high-profile supporters, including Ms. Albright and Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), during a busy day on the campaign trail.\nIn Concord, Ms. Albright shared stories of working with Mrs. Clinton during her eight years as first lady. And Ms. Albright made a forceful push for making history by electing a woman to the countrys highest office.\nPeople are talking about revolution, so what kind of a revolution would it be to have the first woman president of the United States? Ms. Albright said, referring to Sen. Bernie Sanderss call for a political revolution.\nIn an effort to reach the young people the Clinton campaign is aiming to attract from its rival, the campaign advertised the event on the Students for Bernie Sanders subreddit group on the website Reddit and streamed it online on Facebook and received more than 100,000 views.\nMs. Albright said some young women dont understand the importance of supporting Mrs. Clinton, adding that theres more work to be done to break gender barriers.\nIts not done, and you have to help, Ms. Albright said. Hillary Clinton will always be there for you.","gunning_fog_1":"6.8","flesch_1":"5.6","readability_1":"76.22","index_2":"109","title_2":"Donald Trump, Despite Impieties, Wins Hearts of Evangelical Voters","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/donald-trump-despite-impieties-wins-hearts-of-evangelical-voters.html","candidate_2":"Donald Trump","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Abortion","body_2":"OKLAHOMA CITY —  It is one of the prime paradoxes of the 2016 election: A twice-divorced candidate who has flaunted his adultery, praised Planned Parenthood and admitted to never asking for God’s forgiveness is the favorite of the Christian right.\n\nThe candidate, Donald J. Trump, who won with evangelical voters in South Carolina and has their support in other Bible Belt states that will vote in primaries on Tuesday, has dominated the Republican campaign by appealing to the economically disenfranchised. But the promise of a Trump presidency that would gall the political elites is also resonating with the culturally disenfranchised, including many conservative Christians.\n\nMr. Trump’s success with evangelicals, who constitute the largest Republican blocs in six Southern states voting on Tuesday, poses a mortal threat to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose campaign is built on these voters. Mr. Cruz will face nearly insurmountable odds if he fails to carry more than his home state on Super Tuesday, with the race afterward moving to less favorable territory.\n\nMr. Trump’s appeal with the religious right is debunking some long-held maxims about evangelical voters, showing that they are not monolithic; that they do not fall neatly in step with evangelical leaders, many of whom endorsed Mr. Cruz; and that within evangelical ranks lie fault lines of class and culture.\n\n“Social conservatives are taking a look at Trump and saying he’s not with me on all these issues, but the overall larger imperative for us is to tear down this system that has not served us for a very long time,” said Gregg Keller, a former executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which was founded by the Christian conservative Ralph Reed.\n\nIn speeches, including one in Oklahoma City on Friday, Mr. Trump almost never talks about issues that politicians seeking evangelical support thunder about: abortion, religious liberty and, recently, the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice.\n\nPractically the only part of a Trump stump speech aimed at faith-driven voters is a promise that shopkeepers will again be able to say Merry Christmas. It is one of his most reliable applause lines.\n\nMr. Trump is winning with evangelicals, as he does with other Republican primary voters, by promising uncompromising immigration and trade policies and a hard-driving leadership style. “Evangelicals see all that’s going down, and they just like somebody to be strong and stern and consistent on issues,” said J. Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and onetime Baptist pastor, before Mr. Huckabee quit the race.\n\nA CBS News poll of Republican primary voters nationally this month showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz among evangelicals 33 percent to 22 percent.\n\nIn South Carolina, where Mr. Trump won a commanding victory, earning all 50 delegates, he carried evangelicals by six percentage points over Mr. Cruz and 11 percentage points over Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to exit polls.\n\nAfter Mr. Cruz’s brutal South Carolina loss, his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, re-emphasized a Southern strategy, the cornerstone of Mr. Cruz’s campaign since he announced he was running. “We’re going to have a big night on March 1 in an electoral map that favors us,” Mr. Roe said.\n\nBut even though Mr. Cruz won a plurality of evangelicals in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, he faces uncertain prospects in Oklahoma and other Bible Belt states that will vote on Tuesday. Polls show him trailing Mr. Trump in Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama.\n\n“Not everybody is going to follow just because we say this is what we suggest you do,” said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa who is a national co-chairman of the Cruz campaign.\n\nHe expressed frustration that so-called values voters were giving Mr. Trump a pass on issues about his character, such as his mocking of women, as well as his conservative credentials. Mr. Vander Plaats suggested that they were “either hypocritical or uninformed or maybe not interested.”\n\n“It’s not just three marriages,” he said, listing what he called Mr. Trump’s breaks from conservatism. They included donating to Democrats in the past and once suggesting that his sister, a federal judge who struck down a ban on partial-birth abortions in New Jersey, could make a good Supreme Court justice.\n\n“I understand why you’re ticked off at your government,” Mr. Vander Plaats said of evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump. “But if that’s your one rational reason for casting a vote, then I think you lack discernment, judgment and temperament.”\n\nThe emergence of Christian conservatives as a force in Republican politics traces to the Moral Majority movement of the 1970s led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who helped put Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush into office. But the older generation has lost political clout, failing to see its favorites win the Republican nomination in recent presidential cycles, while the American mainstream has embraced same-sex marriage and a more secular culture.\n\nMr. Falwell’s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., now the president of Liberty University, where Mr. Trump called a book in the Bible “Two Corinthians” instead of the more accepted “Second Corinthians” in a speech, has endorsed the billionaire. He cited Mr. Trump’s business record and the strength he projects.\n\n“All the social issues — traditional family values, abortion — are moot if ISIS blows up some of our cities or if the borders are not fortified,” he said, referring to the Islamic State. “Rank-and-file evangelicals are smarter than many of the leaders. They are trying to save the country and maybe vote on social issues next time.”\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by many grass-roots Trump supporters who identify as evangelical, though they may not be regular churchgoers.\n\n“You’re voting for a president; you’re not necessarily voting for a pastor,” said Less McNiff, a retired human resources executive who heard Mr. Trump address thousands at the Oklahoma City rally on Friday. “He’s not necessarily orthodox, but I like the fact that he’s strong.”\n\nLinda Sharp, an elementary school music teacher from Moore, Okla., who attended the rally and plans to vote for Mr. Trump, said, “He’s made moral choices that are not stellar, but I lay that against his business plan or the economic growth for America, and I choose that.”\n\nBut her husband, Phillip Sharp, who is pastor of Heavenly Heights Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, cautioned those who would argue, like the younger Mr. Falwell, that voters should choose a strong leader rather than a pious one.\n\n“I’m sure the Nazis would have said the same thing,” said Mr. Sharp, who favored Mr. Cruz. “You’ve got to be careful when somebody’s trying to make you great.”\n\nSome Trump supporters seem to wrestle aloud with the seeming contradiction between how their faith guides them and their hopes for a Trump presidency.\n\n“I don’t know that Trump is the person to bring God back into our country, but I think if we don’t we’ll have much bigger problems,” said Renae Ehler, an insurance saleswoman from Davenport, Okla., who planned to vote for Mr. Trump. “The business part of things, I think, is going to make a big difference.”\n\nPaul Smith, a machinist in Oklahoma City, called himself a “total Christian” but said he did not attend a church because “I’ve witnessed too much hypocrisy” in churches. “I’ve been with Donald Trump since he put his hat in the race,” he said. “Basically he’s anti-establishment.”","gunning_fog_2":"8.8","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"62.68","index_3":"85","title_3":"Clinton allies forming group to protect, register voters","url_3":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-02-10-US--DEM%202016-Voting%20Rights/id-e858b2a5987a4e69a7937681bad81331","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"the Associated Press","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP)  Allies of Hillary Clinton are forming a new $25 million political organization aimed at expanding voter protection efforts and driving turnout and registration among Latino and black voters essential to her Democratic presidential campaign.\nThe new group, Every Citizen Counts, is beginning its work as Clinton faces a stronger-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose overwhelming victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary has set off new worries among Democrats that Sanders may soon cut into Clinton's advantage with black and Hispanic voters.\nThe non-partisan organization will focus on legislation, litigation, voter registration and turnout among black and Latino communities in the general election. It was formed in August and has recently begun developing partnerships with other organizations to expand voter education, registration, protection and turnout.\nClinton has made voter registration and protection a major part of her agenda with minority voters and her campaign and is planning a significant push in the aftermath of her New Hampshire loss to win minority voters in the two remaining February contests in Nevada and South Carolina and a slew of Southern states holding contests in early March.\nThe group will operate as a nonprofit \"social welfare\" organization, allowing it to take unlimited donations and keep its donors' identities private. Organizers said it would not be involved in the Democratic primaries and would be focused on November's election and beyond.\nClinton said Tuesday night that both she and Sanders wanted to eliminate unaccounted money from politics. But the group's acceptance of private donations will likely draw scorn from Sanders and his allies, who have made the elimination of big, secret money in politics a pillar of his campaign.\nDuring his victory speech in New Hampshire, Sanders said the Clinton team had already thrown everything but the kitchen sink at his  and warned, \"I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well.\"\nEvery Citizen Counts will be advised by Guy Cecil, a former aide to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who currently leads Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC supporting Clinton's bid. Cecil said he will continue in his current role as chief strategist at Priorities USA and other political work.\nAn early leader in the group will be Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who has endorsed Clinton's campaign and will be a prominent supporter for her in Georgia's \"Super Tuesday\" primary on March 1.\nReed said in a statement that the organization would be a \"powerful ally to those who want to make registration and voting easier and fairer. This is at the heart of what it means to be an American.\"\nSanders' allies will likely see the group's role differently. When Priorities USA announced its recent fundraising haul of $50 million through January, Sanders repeatedly told supporters that he had raised \"zero dollars\" for super PACs.\nEvery Citizen Counts is expected to have a budget of at least $25 million, according to a presentation given to potential donors. Among its goals will be expanding voting access in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin.\nThe group already has a partnership with the National Democratic Voting Rights Trust, which has been involved in voting rights litigation in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Ohio. The trust is advised by prominent campaign lawyer Marc Elias, who serves as general counsel for Clinton's presidential campaign.\nSlides in a presentation provided to The Associated Press estimates that the group's litigation would protect the right to vote for 2 million voters in those four states, which will be among the most contested in the November election.\nCecil, who will serve as the organization's senior adviser, said he is putting together a team and advisory board that will oversee the group. He said the group was not aimed solely on the 2016 election but would be \"in this fight for the long haul.\"\n\"There have been too many efforts to restrict access to the polls, making it even more difficult to vote,\" he said. \"We will engage at all levels: pushing for stronger legislation around early voting, same-day registration and vote by mail, waging legal battles to roll back onerous laws and registering voters in underrepresented communities across the country.\"\n__\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter at: https://www.twitter.com/kthomasDC","gunning_fog_3":"12.0","flesch_3":"13.0","readability_3":"46.1","index_4":"63","title_4":"Hillary Clinton Sharpens Focus After Democratic Debate Tussles","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-sharpens-focus-after-democratic-debate-tussles.html","candidate_4":"Hillary Clinton","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"After a debate performance in which she painted Bernie Sanders as a fringe candidate whose policies bordered on fantasy, Hillary Clinton and her allies intensified the pressure on the Vermont senator on Friday, burnishing her embrace of President Obama and seeking to solidify her support among blacks.\n\nFollowing a stinging loss in New Hampshire this week, the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, the “super PAC” that supports her, have sharpened their focus on Mr. Sanders and the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Separately, they have invested in new rounds of advertising intended to blunt any momentum that Mr. Sanders might have gained from his landslide in New Hampshire.\n\nOn Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s team unveiled a new television ad that ties her to Mr. Obama on the issue of tightening gun laws — a perceived weakness of Mr. Sanders. It features the Rev. Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed in the Charleston church shooting, praising Mrs. Clinton for “standing with the president” on firearms restrictions.\n\nDespite the fact that Mrs. Clinton has led in most South Carolina polls, Priorities USA is also leaving nothing to chance there. The group announced on Friday that it is starting its largest advertising campaign to date on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf, investing $500,000 to spread the message on radio stations that the former secretary of state is the true heir to Mr. Obama’s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.\n\n“We need a president who will build on all that President Obama has done,” say the narrators of the ad, which will air in South Carolina communities with large black populations. “President Obama trusted Hillary Clinton to be America’s secretary of state. And we know Hillary Clinton has the vision and courage to help build an economy to support our communities.”\n\nMrs. Clinton is building on the lines of attack she used in Thursday’s Democratic debate in Milwaukee. She criticized Mr. Sanders for disparaging Mr. Obama’s record and accused him of being too narrowly focused on his central mission of breaking up the banks to be sufficiently concerned about issues such as civil rights and criminal justice reform.\n\nThe new push from Priorities USA could leave Mrs. Clinton open to more criticism from the Vermont senator, who has lamented her reliance on big donors as a sign that she is not independent. At the debate, Mrs. Clinton tried to separate herself from the group while also clinging to Mr. Obama.\n\n“You’re referring to a super PAC that we don’t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me,” Mrs. Clinton said in response to a question about what rich donors expect when they give money to political action committees. “They are the ones who should respond to any questions.”\n\nA spokesman for Priorities USA pointed out that super PACs support Mr. Sanders, even though he opposes them. Priorities USA is also spending $4.5 million across the South to turn out voters before several states there hold nominating contests on March 1.\n\nIn the days leading to the South Carolina voting, Mr. Sanders could also be looking for some new answers to tough questions, as Mrs. Clinton took a more aggressive approach to discrediting his foreign policy knowledge and credentials. In one of her more stinging debate blows, Mrs. Clinton said it was not clear to her who Mr. Sanders was seeking counsel from on international affairs.\n\nAsked to note any advisers, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, pointed to an essay published on the Politico magazine website on Thursday by Lawrence Korb, an assistant secretary of defense during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Although Mr. Korb has only met with Mr. Sanders once, he said he is “serious” on foreign policy.\n\n“In my dealings with him, and in analyzing his record in Congress over the past 25 years, I have found that Sanders has taken balanced, realistic positions on many of the most critical foreign policy issues facing the country,” Mr. Korb wrote.\n\nAs the Democrats jockey for position, Republicans, who hold their next presidential debate on Saturday, also have South Carolina on their minds. With their primary election being held a week earlier, on Feb. 20, the sniping among the remaining candidates has reached a fever pitch.\n\nOn Friday, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will gather at the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. They will look to court the evangelical Christians that could be crucial to their success in the state.\n\nDonald J. Trump is not attending the event, but as he faces a tight race with Mr. Cruz in South Carolina, he made sure to weigh in from afar. In a post on Twitter, he rebutted a suggestion made by the Texas senator that Mr. Trump agrees with Mr. Obama on same-sex marriage.\n\n“How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” Mr. Trump said.","gunning_fog_4":"7.6","flesch_4":"7.6","readability_4":"65.73","index_5":"68","title_5":"Pro-Clinton Super PAC Announces Large Fundraising Haul","url_5":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/29/pro-clinton-super-pac-announces-large-fundraising-haul/","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"The main super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said  it is sitting on a war chest of $44.7 million in cash following strong fundraising in the second half of the year, and has lined up tens of millions of dollars in additional commitments, giving Mrs. Clinton a financial advantage as primary season begins.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, said it raised a total of $40.95 million in full-year 2015, and has raised another $9.6 million in January, making its total raised at $50.6 million. The group said it has another $42 million in fundraising commitments, or pledges from its donors to contribute funds in the future.  The numbers were disclosed in a memo from the group’s chief strategist, Guy Cecil.\nSeparate from the super PAC, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has raised $112 million, making her likely the best-funded candidate in the race.   Mrs. Clinton’s primary challenger in the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders, has seen his fundraising accelerate in recent months, bringing in a haul of $75 million for full-year 2015.

But Mr. Bush has struggled to raise money for his campaign, raising just $25 million through September, the most recent figures it has reported.\nMost other candidates have not yet reported their latest fundraising figures, which include money raised and cash on hand. Campaigns have to file their fourth-quarter numbers by Sunday night, while super PAC file their second-half reports.\nIn a memo, Mr. Cecil warned that Republicans’ attacks against Mrs. Clinton will continue, noting that GOP groups have already spent $6 million against her. “They are preparing a billion-dollar campaign to deceive and distort her record for months on end,” Mr. Cecil wrote. “Priorities USA sees it as our responsibility to fight back early and often.”\nMr. Cecil also highlighted support the group had received from labor unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the UA Political Education Committee and the International Union of Operating Engineers.

At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.6875,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T10:12:39+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1953139559,"created_at":"2016-04-08T09:28:47+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T09:25:58+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NY","city":"Rochester","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915117,"worker_id":36313064,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.930803571428571,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"1","q2":"-1","q3":"1","q4":"-1","q5":"1","q6":"1","q7":"0","q8":"0","q9":"1","q10":"-1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"11","index_1":"60","title_1":"Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright’s Exhortation to Women to Back Clinton","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/06/critics-pounce-on-madeleine-albrights-exhortation-to-women-to-back-clinton/","candidate_1":"Hillary Clinton","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"CONCORD, N.H.

As backlash spread, Jesse Lehrich, Mrs. Clinton’s rapid response director, tweeted “peeps freaking out about that Madeleine Albright quote: It’s not new — it was literally on a Starbucks cup.”\nNick Merrill, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, pointed out on Twitter that Ms. Albright had said this “literally hundreds of times.”\nWith only three days remaining until New Hampshires primary, Mrs. Clinton deployed some of her high-profile supporters, including Ms. Albright and Sen.

Trump, who won with evangelical voters in South Carolina and has their support in other Bible Belt states that will vote in primaries on Tuesday, has dominated the Republican campaign by appealing to the economically disenfranchised. But the promise of a Trump presidency that would gall the political elites is also resonating with the culturally disenfranchised, including many conservative Christians.\n\nMr. Trump’s success with evangelicals, who constitute the largest Republican blocs in six Southern states voting on Tuesday, poses a mortal threat to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose campaign is built on these voters. Mr. Cruz will face nearly insurmountable odds if he fails to carry more than his home state on Super Tuesday, with the race afterward moving to less favorable territory.\n\nMr. Trump’s appeal with the religious right is debunking some long-held maxims about evangelical voters, showing that they are not monolithic; that they do not fall neatly in step with evangelical leaders, many of whom endorsed Mr. Cruz; and that within evangelical ranks lie fault lines of class and culture.\n\n“Social conservatives are taking a look at Trump and saying he’s not with me on all these issues, but the overall larger imperative for us is to tear down this system that has not served us for a very long time,” said Gregg Keller, a former executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which was founded by the Christian conservative Ralph Reed.\n\nIn speeches, including one in Oklahoma City on Friday, Mr. Trump almost never talks about issues that politicians seeking evangelical support thunder about: abortion, religious liberty and, recently, the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice.\n\nPractically the only part of a Trump stump speech aimed at faith-driven voters is a promise that shopkeepers will again be able to say Merry Christmas. It is one of his most reliable applause lines.\n\nMr. Trump is winning with evangelicals, as he does with other Republican primary voters, by promising uncompromising immigration and trade policies and a hard-driving leadership style. “Evangelicals see all that’s going down, and they just like somebody to be strong and stern and consistent on issues,” said J. Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and onetime Baptist pastor, before Mr. Huckabee quit the race.\n\nA CBS News poll of Republican primary voters nationally this month showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz among evangelicals 33 percent to 22 percent.\n\nIn South Carolina, where Mr. Trump won a commanding victory, earning all 50 delegates, he carried evangelicals by six percentage points over Mr. Cruz and 11 percentage points over Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to exit polls.\n\nAfter Mr. Cruz’s brutal South Carolina loss, his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, re-emphasized a Southern strategy, the cornerstone of Mr. Cruz’s campaign since he announced he was running. “We’re going to have a big night on March 1 in an electoral map that favors us,” Mr. Roe said.\n\nBut even though Mr. Cruz won a plurality of evangelicals in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, he faces uncertain prospects in Oklahoma and other Bible Belt states that will vote on Tuesday. Polls show him trailing Mr. Trump in Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama.\n\n“Not everybody is going to follow just because we say this is what we suggest you do,” said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa who is a national co-chairman of the Cruz campaign.\n\nHe expressed frustration that so-called values voters were giving Mr. Trump a pass on issues about his character, such as his mocking of women, as well as his conservative credentials. Mr. Vander Plaats suggested that they were “either hypocritical or uninformed or maybe not interested.”\n\n“It’s not just three marriages,” he said, listing what he called Mr. Trump’s breaks from conservatism. They included donating to Democrats in the past and once suggesting that his sister, a federal judge who struck down a ban on partial-birth abortions in New Jersey, could make a good Supreme Court justice.\n\n“I understand why you’re ticked off at your government,” Mr. Vander Plaats said of evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump. “But if that’s your one rational reason for casting a vote, then I think you lack discernment, judgment and temperament.”\n\nThe emergence of Christian conservatives as a force in Republican politics traces to the Moral Majority movement of the 1970s led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who helped put Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush into office. But the older generation has lost political clout, failing to see its favorites win the Republican nomination in recent presidential cycles, while the American mainstream has embraced same-sex marriage and a more secular culture.\n\nMr. Falwell’s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., now the president of Liberty University, where Mr. Trump called a book in the Bible “Two Corinthians” instead of the more accepted “Second Corinthians” in a speech, has endorsed the billionaire. He cited Mr. Trump’s business record and the strength he projects.\n\n“All the social issues — traditional family values, abortion — are moot if ISIS blows up some of our cities or if the borders are not fortified,” he said, referring to the Islamic State. “Rank-and-file evangelicals are smarter than many of the leaders. They are trying to save the country and maybe vote on social issues next time.”\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by many grass-roots Trump supporters who identify as evangelical, though they may not be regular churchgoers.\n\n“You’re voting for a president; you’re not necessarily voting for a pastor,” said Less McNiff, a retired human resources executive who heard Mr. Trump address thousands at the Oklahoma City rally on Friday. “He’s not necessarily orthodox, but I like the fact that he’s strong.”\n\nLinda Sharp, an elementary school music teacher from Moore, Okla., who attended the rally and plans to vote for Mr. Trump, said, “He’s made moral choices that are not stellar, but I lay that against his business plan or the economic growth for America, and I choose that.”\n\nBut her husband, Phillip Sharp, who is pastor of Heavenly Heights Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, cautioned those who would argue, like the younger Mr. Falwell, that voters should choose a strong leader rather than a pious one.\n\n“I’m sure the Nazis would have said the same thing,” said Mr. Sharp, who favored Mr. Cruz. “You’ve got to be careful when somebody’s trying to make you great.”\n\nSome Trump supporters seem to wrestle aloud with the seeming contradiction between how their faith guides them and their hopes for a Trump presidency.\n\n“I don’t know that Trump is the person to bring God back into our country, but I think if we don’t we’ll have much bigger problems,” said Renae Ehler, an insurance saleswoman from Davenport, Okla., who planned to vote for Mr. Trump. “The business part of things, I think, is going to make a big difference.”\n\nPaul Smith, a machinist in Oklahoma City, called himself a “total Christian” but said he did not attend a church because “I’ve witnessed too much hypocrisy” in churches. “I’ve been with Donald Trump since he put his hat in the race,” he said. “Basically he’s anti-establishment.”","gunning_fog_2":"8.8","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"62.68","index_3":"85","title_3":"Clinton allies forming group to protect, register voters","url_3":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-02-10-US--DEM%202016-Voting%20Rights/id-e858b2a5987a4e69a7937681bad81331","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"the Associated Press","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"MANCHESTER, N.H.

Bernie Sanders, whose overwhelming victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary has set off new worries among Democrats that Sanders may soon cut into Clinton's advantage with black and Hispanic voters.\nThe non-partisan organization will focus on legislation, litigation, voter registration and turnout among black and Latino communities in the general election. It was formed in August and has recently begun developing partnerships with other organizations to expand voter education, registration, protection and turnout.\nClinton has made voter registration and protection a major part of her agenda with minority voters and her campaign and is planning a significant push in the aftermath of her New Hampshire loss to win minority voters in the two remaining February contests in Nevada and South Carolina and a slew of Southern states holding contests in early March.\nThe group will operate as a nonprofit \"social welfare\" organization, allowing it to take unlimited donations and keep its donors' identities private. Organizers said it would not be involved in the Democratic primaries and would be focused on November's election and beyond.\nClinton said Tuesday night that both she and Sanders wanted to eliminate unaccounted money from politics. But the group's acceptance of private donations will likely draw scorn from Sanders and his allies, who have made the elimination of big, secret money in politics a pillar of his campaign.\nDuring his victory speech in New Hampshire, Sanders said the Clinton team had already thrown everything but the kitchen sink at his  and warned, \"I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well.\"\nEvery Citizen Counts will be advised by Guy Cecil, a former aide to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who currently leads Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC supporting Clinton's bid. Cecil said he will continue in his current role as chief strategist at Priorities USA and other political work.\nAn early leader in the group will be Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who has endorsed Clinton's campaign and will be a prominent supporter for her in Georgia's \"Super Tuesday\" primary on March 1.\nReed said in a statement that the organization would be a \"powerful ally to those who want to make registration and voting easier and fairer. This is at the heart of what it means to be an American.\"\nSanders' allies will likely see the group's role differently. When Priorities USA announced its recent fundraising haul of $50 million through January, Sanders repeatedly told supporters that he had raised \"zero dollars\" for super PACs.\nEvery Citizen Counts is expected to have a budget of at least $25 million, according to a presentation given to potential donors. Among its goals will be expanding voting access in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin.\nThe group already has a partnership with the National Democratic Voting Rights Trust, which has been involved in voting rights litigation in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Ohio. The trust is advised by prominent campaign lawyer Marc Elias, who serves as general counsel for Clinton's presidential campaign.\nSlides in a presentation provided to The Associated Press estimates that the group's litigation would protect the right to vote for 2 million voters in those four states, which will be among the most contested in the November election.\nCecil, who will serve as the organization's senior adviser, said he is putting together a team and advisory board that will oversee the group. He said the group was not aimed solely on the 2016 election but would be \"in this fight for the long haul.\"\n\"There have been too many efforts to restrict access to the polls, making it even more difficult to vote,\" he said. \"We will engage at all levels: pushing for stronger legislation around early voting, same-day registration and vote by mail, waging legal battles to roll back onerous laws and registering voters in underrepresented communities across the country.\"\n__\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter at: https://www.twitter.com/kthomasDC","gunning_fog_3":"12.0","flesch_3":"13.0","readability_3":"46.1","index_4":"63","title_4":"Hillary Clinton Sharpens Focus After Democratic Debate Tussles","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-sharpens-focus-after-democratic-debate-tussles.html","candidate_4":"Hillary Clinton","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"After a debate performance in which she painted Bernie Sanders as a fringe candidate whose policies bordered on fantasy, Hillary Clinton and her allies intensified the pressure on the Vermont senator on Friday, burnishing her embrace of President Obama and seeking to solidify her support among blacks.\n\nFollowing a stinging loss in New Hampshire this week, the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, the “super PAC” that supports her, have sharpened their focus on Mr. Sanders and the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Separately, they have invested in new rounds of advertising intended to blunt any momentum that Mr. Sanders might have gained from his landslide in New Hampshire.\n\nOn Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s team unveiled a new television ad that ties her to Mr. Obama on the issue of tightening gun laws — a perceived weakness of Mr. Sanders. It features the Rev. Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed in the Charleston church shooting, praising Mrs. Clinton for “standing with the president” on firearms restrictions.\n\nDespite the fact that Mrs. Clinton has led in most South Carolina polls, Priorities USA is also leaving nothing to chance there. The group announced on Friday that it is starting its largest advertising campaign to date on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf, investing $500,000 to spread the message on radio stations that the former secretary of state is the true heir to Mr. Obama’s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.\n\n“We need a president who will build on all that President Obama has done,” say the narrators of the ad, which will air in South Carolina communities with large black populations. “President Obama trusted Hillary Clinton to be America’s secretary of state. And we know Hillary Clinton has the vision and courage to help build an economy to support our communities.”\n\nMrs. Clinton is building on the lines of attack she used in Thursday’s Democratic debate in Milwaukee. She criticized Mr. Sanders for disparaging Mr. Obama’s record and accused him of being too narrowly focused on his central mission of breaking up the banks to be sufficiently concerned about issues such as civil rights and criminal justice reform.\n\nThe new push from Priorities USA could leave Mrs. Clinton open to more criticism from the Vermont senator, who has lamented her reliance on big donors as a sign that she is not independent. At the debate, Mrs. Clinton tried to separate herself from the group while also clinging to Mr. Obama.\n\n“You’re referring to a super PAC that we don’t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me,” Mrs. Clinton said in response to a question about what rich donors expect when they give money to political action committees. “They are the ones who should respond to any questions.”\n\nA spokesman for Priorities USA pointed out that super PACs support Mr. Sanders, even though he opposes them. Priorities USA is also spending $4.5 million across the South to turn out voters before several states there hold nominating contests on March 1.\n\nIn the days leading to the South Carolina voting, Mr. Sanders could also be looking for some new answers to tough questions, as Mrs. Clinton took a more aggressive approach to discrediting his foreign policy knowledge and credentials. In one of her more stinging debate blows, Mrs. Clinton said it was not clear to her who Mr. Sanders was seeking counsel from on international affairs.\n\nAsked to note any advisers, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, pointed to an essay published on the Politico magazine website on Thursday by Lawrence Korb, an assistant secretary of defense during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Although Mr. Korb has only met with Mr. Sanders once, he said he is “serious” on foreign policy.\n\n“In my dealings with him, and in analyzing his record in Congress over the past 25 years, I have found that Sanders has taken balanced, realistic positions on many of the most critical foreign policy issues facing the country,” Mr. Korb wrote.\n\nAs the Democrats jockey for position, Republicans, who hold their next presidential debate on Saturday, also have South Carolina on their minds. With their primary election being held a week earlier, on Feb. 20, the sniping among the remaining candidates has reached a fever pitch.\n\nOn Friday, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will gather at the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. They will look to court the evangelical Christians that could be crucial to their success in the state.\n\nDonald J. Trump is not attending the event, but as he faces a tight race with Mr. Cruz in South Carolina, he made sure to weigh in from afar. In a post on Twitter, he rebutted a suggestion made by the Texas senator that Mr. Trump agrees with Mr. Obama on same-sex marriage.\n\n“How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” Mr. Trump said.","gunning_fog_4":"7.6","flesch_4":"7.6","readability_4":"65.73","index_5":"68","title_5":"Pro-Clinton Super PAC Announces Large Fundraising Haul","url_5":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/29/pro-clinton-super-pac-announces-large-fundraising-haul/","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"The main super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said  it is sitting on a war chest of $44.7 million in cash following strong fundraising in the second half of the year, and has lined up tens of millions of dollars in additional commitments, giving Mrs. Clinton a financial advantage as primary season begins.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, said it raised a total of $40.95 million in full-year 2015, and has raised another $9.6 million in January, making its total raised at $50.6 million.

At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}},{"id":1953163524,"created_at":"2016-04-08T10:08:34+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T09:55:01+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NJ","city":"Toms River","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915117,"worker_id":2034278,"trust":0.6875,"worker_trust":0.93125,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"0","q2":"0","q3":"1","q4":"-1","q5":"0","q6":"-1","q7":"0","q8":"0","q9":"0","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"donald_trump"},"unit_data":{"nil":"11","index_1":"60","title_1":"Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright’s Exhortation to Women to Back Clinton","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/06/critics-pounce-on-madeleine-albrights-exhortation-to-women-to-back-clinton/","candidate_1":"Hillary Clinton","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"CONCORD, N.H.

But online, the reaction was much different.\nPlayed in short video clips online or quoted in tweets, the quote almost sounded like a threat to other women: help Hillary Clinton or else.\nSome on social media asked if they should also be helping the other woman in the 2016 race, former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina. Others expressed surprise at the idea that a women should be forced to vote for a woman — instead of being free to chose based on issues.

It’s from a speech she gave in 2006 as a keynote speaker. As backlash spread, Jesse Lehrich, Mrs. Clinton’s rapid response director, tweeted “peeps freaking out about that Madeleine Albright quote: It’s not new — it was literally on a Starbucks cup.”\nNick Merrill, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, pointed out on Twitter that Ms. Albright had said this “literally hundreds of times.”\nWith only three days remaining until New Hampshires primary, Mrs. Clinton deployed some of her high-profile supporters, including Ms. Albright and Sen.

Trump, who won with evangelical voters in South Carolina and has their support in other Bible Belt states that will vote in primaries on Tuesday, has dominated the Republican campaign by appealing to the economically disenfranchised. But the promise of a Trump presidency that would gall the political elites is also resonating with the culturally disenfranchised, including many conservative Christians.\n\nMr. Trump’s success with evangelicals, who constitute the largest Republican blocs in six Southern states voting on Tuesday, poses a mortal threat to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose campaign is built on these voters. Mr. Cruz will face nearly insurmountable odds if he fails to carry more than his home state on Super Tuesday, with the race afterward moving to less favorable territory.\n\nMr. Trump’s appeal with the religious right is debunking some long-held maxims about evangelical voters, showing that they are not monolithic; that they do not fall neatly in step with evangelical leaders, many of whom endorsed Mr. Cruz; and that within evangelical ranks lie fault lines of class and culture.\n\n“Social conservatives are taking a look at Trump and saying he’s not with me on all these issues, but the overall larger imperative for us is to tear down this system that has not served us for a very long time,” said Gregg Keller, a former executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which was founded by the Christian conservative Ralph Reed.\n\nIn speeches, including one in Oklahoma City on Friday, Mr. Trump almost never talks about issues that politicians seeking evangelical support thunder about: abortion, religious liberty and, recently, the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice.\n\nPractically the only part of a Trump stump speech aimed at faith-driven voters is a promise that shopkeepers will again be able to say Merry Christmas. It is one of his most reliable applause lines.\n\nMr. Trump is winning with evangelicals, as he does with other Republican primary voters, by promising uncompromising immigration and trade policies and a hard-driving leadership style. “Evangelicals see all that’s going down, and they just like somebody to be strong and stern and consistent on issues,” said J. Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and onetime Baptist pastor, before Mr. Huckabee quit the race.\n\nA CBS News poll of Republican primary voters nationally this month showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz among evangelicals 33 percent to 22 percent.\n\nIn South Carolina, where Mr. Trump won a commanding victory, earning all 50 delegates, he carried evangelicals by six percentage points over Mr. Cruz and 11 percentage points over Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to exit polls.\n\nAfter Mr. Cruz’s brutal South Carolina loss, his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, re-emphasized a Southern strategy, the cornerstone of Mr. Cruz’s campaign since he announced he was running. “We’re going to have a big night on March 1 in an electoral map that favors us,” Mr. Roe said.\n\nBut even though Mr. Cruz won a plurality of evangelicals in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, he faces uncertain prospects in Oklahoma and other Bible Belt states that will vote on Tuesday. Polls show him trailing Mr. Trump in Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama.\n\n“Not everybody is going to follow just because we say this is what we suggest you do,” said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa who is a national co-chairman of the Cruz campaign.\n\nHe expressed frustration that so-called values voters were giving Mr. Trump a pass on issues about his character, such as his mocking of women, as well as his conservative credentials. Mr. Vander Plaats suggested that they were “either hypocritical or uninformed or maybe not interested.”\n\n“It’s not just three marriages,” he said, listing what he called Mr. Trump’s breaks from conservatism. They included donating to Democrats in the past and once suggesting that his sister, a federal judge who struck down a ban on partial-birth abortions in New Jersey, could make a good Supreme Court justice.\n\n“I understand why you’re ticked off at your government,” Mr. Vander Plaats said of evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump. “But if that’s your one rational reason for casting a vote, then I think you lack discernment, judgment and temperament.”\n\nThe emergence of Christian conservatives as a force in Republican politics traces to the Moral Majority movement of the 1970s led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who helped put Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush into office. But the older generation has lost political clout, failing to see its favorites win the Republican nomination in recent presidential cycles, while the American mainstream has embraced same-sex marriage and a more secular culture.\n\nMr. Falwell’s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., now the president of Liberty University, where Mr. Trump called a book in the Bible “Two Corinthians” instead of the more accepted “Second Corinthians” in a speech, has endorsed the billionaire. He cited Mr. Trump’s business record and the strength he projects.\n\n“All the social issues — traditional family values, abortion — are moot if ISIS blows up some of our cities or if the borders are not fortified,” he said, referring to the Islamic State. “Rank-and-file evangelicals are smarter than many of the leaders. They are trying to save the country and maybe vote on social issues next time.”\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by many grass-roots Trump supporters who identify as evangelical, though they may not be regular churchgoers.\n\n“You’re voting for a president; you’re not necessarily voting for a pastor,” said Less McNiff, a retired human resources executive who heard Mr. Trump address thousands at the Oklahoma City rally on Friday. “He’s not necessarily orthodox, but I like the fact that he’s strong.”\n\nLinda Sharp, an elementary school music teacher from Moore, Okla., who attended the rally and plans to vote for Mr. Trump, said, “He’s made moral choices that are not stellar, but I lay that against his business plan or the economic growth for America, and I choose that.”\n\nBut her husband, Phillip Sharp, who is pastor of Heavenly Heights Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, cautioned those who would argue, like the younger Mr. Falwell, that voters should choose a strong leader rather than a pious one.\n\n“I’m sure the Nazis would have said the same thing,” said Mr. Sharp, who favored Mr. Cruz. “You’ve got to be careful when somebody’s trying to make you great.”\n\nSome Trump supporters seem to wrestle aloud with the seeming contradiction between how their faith guides them and their hopes for a Trump presidency.\n\n“I don’t know that Trump is the person to bring God back into our country, but I think if we don’t we’ll have much bigger problems,” said Renae Ehler, an insurance saleswoman from Davenport, Okla., who planned to vote for Mr. Trump. “The business part of things, I think, is going to make a big difference.”\n\nPaul Smith, a machinist in Oklahoma City, called himself a “total Christian” but said he did not attend a church because “I’ve witnessed too much hypocrisy” in churches. “I’ve been with Donald Trump since he put his hat in the race,” he said. “Basically he’s anti-establishment.”","gunning_fog_2":"8.8","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"62.68","index_3":"85","title_3":"Clinton allies forming group to protect, register voters","url_3":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-02-10-US--DEM%202016-Voting%20Rights/id-e858b2a5987a4e69a7937681bad81331","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"the Associated Press","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP)  Allies of Hillary Clinton are forming a new $25 million political organization aimed at expanding voter protection efforts and driving turnout and registration among Latino and black voters essential to her Democratic presidential campaign.\nThe new group, Every Citizen Counts, is beginning its work as Clinton faces a stronger-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose overwhelming victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary has set off new worries among Democrats that Sanders may soon cut into Clinton's advantage with black and Hispanic voters.\nThe non-partisan organization will focus on legislation, litigation, voter registration and turnout among black and Latino communities in the general election. It was formed in August and has recently begun developing partnerships with other organizations to expand voter education, registration, protection and turnout.\nClinton has made voter registration and protection a major part of her agenda with minority voters and her campaign and is planning a significant push in the aftermath of her New Hampshire loss to win minority voters in the two remaining February contests in Nevada and South Carolina and a slew of Southern states holding contests in early March.\nThe group will operate as a nonprofit \"social welfare\" organization, allowing it to take unlimited donations and keep its donors' identities private. Organizers said it would not be involved in the Democratic primaries and would be focused on November's election and beyond.\nClinton said Tuesday night that both she and Sanders wanted to eliminate unaccounted money from politics. But the group's acceptance of private donations will likely draw scorn from Sanders and his allies, who have made the elimination of big, secret money in politics a pillar of his campaign.\nDuring his victory speech in New Hampshire, Sanders said the Clinton team had already thrown everything but the kitchen sink at his  and warned, \"I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well.\"\nEvery Citizen Counts will be advised by Guy Cecil, a former aide to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who currently leads Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC supporting Clinton's bid. Cecil said he will continue in his current role as chief strategist at Priorities USA and other political work.\nAn early leader in the group will be Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who has endorsed Clinton's campaign and will be a prominent supporter for her in Georgia's \"Super Tuesday\" primary on March 1.\nReed said in a statement that the organization would be a \"powerful ally to those who want to make registration and voting easier and fairer. This is at the heart of what it means to be an American.\"\nSanders' allies will likely see the group's role differently. When Priorities USA announced its recent fundraising haul of $50 million through January, Sanders repeatedly told supporters that he had raised \"zero dollars\" for super PACs.\nEvery Citizen Counts is expected to have a budget of at least $25 million, according to a presentation given to potential donors. Among its goals will be expanding voting access in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin.\nThe group already has a partnership with the National Democratic Voting Rights Trust, which has been involved in voting rights litigation in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Ohio. The trust is advised by prominent campaign lawyer Marc Elias, who serves as general counsel for Clinton's presidential campaign.\nSlides in a presentation provided to The Associated Press estimates that the group's litigation would protect the right to vote for 2 million voters in those four states, which will be among the most contested in the November election.\nCecil, who will serve as the organization's senior adviser, said he is putting together a team and advisory board that will oversee the group. He said the group was not aimed solely on the 2016 election but would be \"in this fight for the long haul.\"\n\"There have been too many efforts to restrict access to the polls, making it even more difficult to vote,\" he said. \"We will engage at all levels: pushing for stronger legislation around early voting, same-day registration and vote by mail, waging legal battles to roll back onerous laws and registering voters in underrepresented communities across the country.\"\n__\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter at: https://www.twitter.com/kthomasDC","gunning_fog_3":"12.0","flesch_3":"13.0","readability_3":"46.1","index_4":"63","title_4":"Hillary Clinton Sharpens Focus After Democratic Debate Tussles","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-sharpens-focus-after-democratic-debate-tussles.html","candidate_4":"Hillary Clinton","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"After a debate performance in which she painted Bernie Sanders as a fringe candidate whose policies bordered on fantasy, Hillary Clinton and her allies intensified the pressure on the Vermont senator on Friday, burnishing her embrace of President Obama and seeking to solidify her support among blacks.\n\nFollowing a stinging loss in New Hampshire this week, the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, the “super PAC” that supports her, have sharpened their focus on Mr. Sanders and the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Separately, they have invested in new rounds of advertising intended to blunt any momentum that Mr. Sanders might have gained from his landslide in New Hampshire.\n\nOn Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s team unveiled a new television ad that ties her to Mr. Obama on the issue of tightening gun laws — a perceived weakness of Mr. Sanders. It features the Rev. Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed in the Charleston church shooting, praising Mrs. Clinton for “standing with the president” on firearms restrictions.\n\nDespite the fact that Mrs. Clinton has led in most South Carolina polls, Priorities USA is also leaving nothing to chance there. The group announced on Friday that it is starting its largest advertising campaign to date on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf, investing $500,000 to spread the message on radio stations that the former secretary of state is the true heir to Mr. Obama’s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.\n\n“We need a president who will build on all that President Obama has done,” say the narrators of the ad, which will air in South Carolina communities with large black populations. “President Obama trusted Hillary Clinton to be America’s secretary of state. And we know Hillary Clinton has the vision and courage to help build an economy to support our communities.”\n\nMrs. Clinton is building on the lines of attack she used in Thursday’s Democratic debate in Milwaukee. She criticized Mr. Sanders for disparaging Mr. Obama’s record and accused him of being too narrowly focused on his central mission of breaking up the banks to be sufficiently concerned about issues such as civil rights and criminal justice reform.\n\nThe new push from Priorities USA could leave Mrs. Clinton open to more criticism from the Vermont senator, who has lamented her reliance on big donors as a sign that she is not independent. At the debate, Mrs. Clinton tried to separate herself from the group while also clinging to Mr. Obama.\n\n“You’re referring to a super PAC that we don’t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me,” Mrs. Clinton said in response to a question about what rich donors expect when they give money to political action committees. “They are the ones who should respond to any questions.”\n\nA spokesman for Priorities USA pointed out that super PACs support Mr. Sanders, even though he opposes them. Priorities USA is also spending $4.5 million across the South to turn out voters before several states there hold nominating contests on March 1.\n\nIn the days leading to the South Carolina voting, Mr. Sanders could also be looking for some new answers to tough questions, as Mrs. Clinton took a more aggressive approach to discrediting his foreign policy knowledge and credentials. In one of her more stinging debate blows, Mrs. Clinton said it was not clear to her who Mr. Sanders was seeking counsel from on international affairs.\n\nAsked to note any advisers, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, pointed to an essay published on the Politico magazine website on Thursday by Lawrence Korb, an assistant secretary of defense during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Although Mr. Korb has only met with Mr. Sanders once, he said he is “serious” on foreign policy.\n\n“In my dealings with him, and in analyzing his record in Congress over the past 25 years, I have found that Sanders has taken balanced, realistic positions on many of the most critical foreign policy issues facing the country,” Mr. Korb wrote.\n\nAs the Democrats jockey for position, Republicans, who hold their next presidential debate on Saturday, also have South Carolina on their minds. With their primary election being held a week earlier, on Feb. 20, the sniping among the remaining candidates has reached a fever pitch.\n\nOn Friday, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will gather at the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. They will look to court the evangelical Christians that could be crucial to their success in the state.\n\nDonald J. Trump is not attending the event, but as he faces a tight race with Mr. Cruz in South Carolina, he made sure to weigh in from afar. In a post on Twitter, he rebutted a suggestion made by the Texas senator that Mr. Trump agrees with Mr. Obama on same-sex marriage.\n\n“How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” Mr. Trump said.","gunning_fog_4":"7.6","flesch_4":"7.6","readability_4":"65.73","index_5":"68","title_5":"Pro-Clinton Super PAC Announces Large Fundraising Haul","url_5":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/29/pro-clinton-super-pac-announces-large-fundraising-haul/","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"The main super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said  it is sitting on a war chest of $44.7 million in cash following strong fundraising in the second half of the year, and has lined up tens of millions of dollars in additional commitments, giving Mrs. Clinton a financial advantage as primary season begins.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, said it raised a total of $40.95 million in full-year 2015, and has raised another $9.6 million in January, making its total raised at $50.6 million. The group said it has another $42 million in fundraising commitments, or pledges from its donors to contribute funds in the future.  The numbers were disclosed in a memo from the group’s chief strategist, Guy Cecil.\nSeparate from the super PAC, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has raised $112 million, making her likely the best-funded candidate in the race.   Mrs. Clinton’s primary challenger in the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders, has seen his fundraising accelerate in recent months, bringing in a haul of $75 million for full-year 2015. But the Vermont senator does not have an allied super PAC–though that doesn’t mean outside groups haven’t spent money on his behalf.\nOn the Republican side, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush‘s super PAC was by far the wealthiest as of the most recent filing in July, when it said it had raised $103 million. But Mr. Bush has struggled to raise money for his campaign, raising just $25 million through September, the most recent figures it has reported.\nMost other candidates have not yet reported their latest fundraising figures, which include money raised and cash on hand. Campaigns have to file their fourth-quarter numbers by Sunday night, while super PAC file their second-half reports.\nIn a memo, Mr. Cecil warned that Republicans’ attacks against Mrs. Clinton will continue, noting that GOP groups have already spent $6 million against her. “They are preparing a billion-dollar campaign to deceive and distort her record for months on end,” Mr. Cecil wrote. “Priorities USA sees it as our responsibility to fight back early and often.”\nMr. Cecil also highlighted support the group had received from labor unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the UA Political Education Committee and the International Union of Operating Engineers. Mr. Sanders has also been popular among labor unions.\nAmong Priorities top donors in the first half the year were a slew of billionaires, including financier Donald Sussman, global investor George Soros and media magnate Haim Saban.

I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}},{"id":1953165593,"created_at":"2016-04-08T10:12:28+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T10:05:10+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"OH","city":"Mansfield","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915117,"worker_id":6579519,"trust":0.604166666666667,"worker_trust":0.960416666666667,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"1","q2":"0","q3":"1","q4":"0","q5":"1","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"1","q9":"0","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"11","index_1":"60","title_1":"Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright’s Exhortation to Women to Back Clinton","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/06/critics-pounce-on-madeleine-albrights-exhortation-to-women-to-back-clinton/","candidate_1":"Hillary Clinton","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"CONCORD, N.H.

But online, the reaction was much different.\nPlayed in short video clips online or quoted in tweets, the quote almost sounded like a threat to other women: help Hillary Clinton or else.\nSome on social media asked if they should also be helping the other woman in the 2016 race, former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina. Others expressed surprise at the idea that a women should be forced to vote for a woman — instead of being free to chose based on issues.

As backlash spread, Jesse Lehrich, Mrs. Clinton’s rapid response director, tweeted “peeps freaking out about that Madeleine Albright quote: It’s not new — it was literally on a Starbucks cup.”\nNick Merrill, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, pointed out on Twitter that Ms. Albright had said this “literally hundreds of times.”\nWith only three days remaining until New Hampshires primary, Mrs. Clinton deployed some of her high-profile supporters, including Ms. Albright and Sen.

Trump, who won with evangelical voters in South Carolina and has their support in other Bible Belt states that will vote in primaries on Tuesday, has dominated the Republican campaign by appealing to the economically disenfranchised. But the promise of a Trump presidency that would gall the political elites is also resonating with the culturally disenfranchised, including many conservative Christians.\n\nMr. Trump’s success with evangelicals, who constitute the largest Republican blocs in six Southern states voting on Tuesday, poses a mortal threat to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose campaign is built on these voters. Mr. Cruz will face nearly insurmountable odds if he fails to carry more than his home state on Super Tuesday, with the race afterward moving to less favorable territory.\n\nMr. Trump’s appeal with the religious right is debunking some long-held maxims about evangelical voters, showing that they are not monolithic; that they do not fall neatly in step with evangelical leaders, many of whom endorsed Mr. Cruz; and that within evangelical ranks lie fault lines of class and culture.\n\n“Social conservatives are taking a look at Trump and saying he’s not with me on all these issues, but the overall larger imperative for us is to tear down this system that has not served us for a very long time,” said Gregg Keller, a former executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which was founded by the Christian conservative Ralph Reed.\n\nIn speeches, including one in Oklahoma City on Friday, Mr. Trump almost never talks about issues that politicians seeking evangelical support thunder about: abortion, religious liberty and, recently, the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice.\n\nPractically the only part of a Trump stump speech aimed at faith-driven voters is a promise that shopkeepers will again be able to say Merry Christmas. It is one of his most reliable applause lines.\n\nMr. Trump is winning with evangelicals, as he does with other Republican primary voters, by promising uncompromising immigration and trade policies and a hard-driving leadership style. “Evangelicals see all that’s going down, and they just like somebody to be strong and stern and consistent on issues,” said J. Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and onetime Baptist pastor, before Mr. Huckabee quit the race.\n\nA CBS News poll of Republican primary voters nationally this month showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz among evangelicals 33 percent to 22 percent.\n\nIn South Carolina, where Mr. Trump won a commanding victory, earning all 50 delegates, he carried evangelicals by six percentage points over Mr. Cruz and 11 percentage points over Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to exit polls.\n\nAfter Mr. Cruz’s brutal South Carolina loss, his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, re-emphasized a Southern strategy, the cornerstone of Mr. Cruz’s campaign since he announced he was running. “We’re going to have a big night on March 1 in an electoral map that favors us,” Mr. Roe said.\n\nBut even though Mr. Cruz won a plurality of evangelicals in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, he faces uncertain prospects in Oklahoma and other Bible Belt states that will vote on Tuesday. Polls show him trailing Mr. Trump in Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama.\n\n“Not everybody is going to follow just because we say this is what we suggest you do,” said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa who is a national co-chairman of the Cruz campaign.\n\nHe expressed frustration that so-called values voters were giving Mr. Trump a pass on issues about his character, such as his mocking of women, as well as his conservative credentials. Mr. Vander Plaats suggested that they were “either hypocritical or uninformed or maybe not interested.”\n\n“It’s not just three marriages,” he said, listing what he called Mr. Trump’s breaks from conservatism. They included donating to Democrats in the past and once suggesting that his sister, a federal judge who struck down a ban on partial-birth abortions in New Jersey, could make a good Supreme Court justice.\n\n“I understand why you’re ticked off at your government,” Mr. Vander Plaats said of evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump. “But if that’s your one rational reason for casting a vote, then I think you lack discernment, judgment and temperament.”\n\nThe emergence of Christian conservatives as a force in Republican politics traces to the Moral Majority movement of the 1970s led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who helped put Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush into office. But the older generation has lost political clout, failing to see its favorites win the Republican nomination in recent presidential cycles, while the American mainstream has embraced same-sex marriage and a more secular culture.\n\nMr. Falwell’s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., now the president of Liberty University, where Mr. Trump called a book in the Bible “Two Corinthians” instead of the more accepted “Second Corinthians” in a speech, has endorsed the billionaire. He cited Mr. Trump’s business record and the strength he projects.\n\n“All the social issues — traditional family values, abortion — are moot if ISIS blows up some of our cities or if the borders are not fortified,” he said, referring to the Islamic State. “Rank-and-file evangelicals are smarter than many of the leaders. They are trying to save the country and maybe vote on social issues next time.”\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by many grass-roots Trump supporters who identify as evangelical, though they may not be regular churchgoers.\n\n“You’re voting for a president; you’re not necessarily voting for a pastor,” said Less McNiff, a retired human resources executive who heard Mr. Trump address thousands at the Oklahoma City rally on Friday. “He’s not necessarily orthodox, but I like the fact that he’s strong.”\n\nLinda Sharp, an elementary school music teacher from Moore, Okla., who attended the rally and plans to vote for Mr. Trump, said, “He’s made moral choices that are not stellar, but I lay that against his business plan or the economic growth for America, and I choose that.”\n\nBut her husband, Phillip Sharp, who is pastor of Heavenly Heights Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, cautioned those who would argue, like the younger Mr. Falwell, that voters should choose a strong leader rather than a pious one.\n\n“I’m sure the Nazis would have said the same thing,” said Mr. Sharp, who favored Mr. Cruz. “You’ve got to be careful when somebody’s trying to make you great.”\n\nSome Trump supporters seem to wrestle aloud with the seeming contradiction between how their faith guides them and their hopes for a Trump presidency.\n\n“I don’t know that Trump is the person to bring God back into our country, but I think if we don’t we’ll have much bigger problems,” said Renae Ehler, an insurance saleswoman from Davenport, Okla., who planned to vote for Mr. Trump. “The business part of things, I think, is going to make a big difference.”\n\nPaul Smith, a machinist in Oklahoma City, called himself a “total Christian” but said he did not attend a church because “I’ve witnessed too much hypocrisy” in churches. “I’ve been with Donald Trump since he put his hat in the race,” he said. “Basically he’s anti-establishment.”","gunning_fog_2":"8.8","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"62.68","index_3":"85","title_3":"Clinton allies forming group to protect, register voters","url_3":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-02-10-US--DEM%202016-Voting%20Rights/id-e858b2a5987a4e69a7937681bad81331","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"the Associated Press","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP)  Allies of Hillary Clinton are forming a new $25 million political organization aimed at expanding voter protection efforts and driving turnout and registration among Latino and black voters essential to her Democratic presidential campaign.\nThe new group, Every Citizen Counts, is beginning its work as Clinton faces a stronger-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose overwhelming victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary has set off new worries among Democrats that Sanders may soon cut into Clinton's advantage with black and Hispanic voters.\nThe non-partisan organization will focus on legislation, litigation, voter registration and turnout among black and Latino communities in the general election. It was formed in August and has recently begun developing partnerships with other organizations to expand voter education, registration, protection and turnout.\nClinton has made voter registration and protection a major part of her agenda with minority voters and her campaign and is planning a significant push in the aftermath of her New Hampshire loss to win minority voters in the two remaining February contests in Nevada and South Carolina and a slew of Southern states holding contests in early March.\nThe group will operate as a nonprofit \"social welfare\" organization, allowing it to take unlimited donations and keep its donors' identities private. Organizers said it would not be involved in the Democratic primaries and would be focused on November's election and beyond.\nClinton said Tuesday night that both she and Sanders wanted to eliminate unaccounted money from politics. But the group's acceptance of private donations will likely draw scorn from Sanders and his allies, who have made the elimination of big, secret money in politics a pillar of his campaign.\nDuring his victory speech in New Hampshire, Sanders said the Clinton team had already thrown everything but the kitchen sink at his  and warned, \"I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well.\"\nEvery Citizen Counts will be advised by Guy Cecil, a former aide to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who currently leads Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC supporting Clinton's bid. Cecil said he will continue in his current role as chief strategist at Priorities USA and other political work.\nAn early leader in the group will be Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who has endorsed Clinton's campaign and will be a prominent supporter for her in Georgia's \"Super Tuesday\" primary on March 1.\nReed said in a statement that the organization would be a \"powerful ally to those who want to make registration and voting easier and fairer. This is at the heart of what it means to be an American.\"\nSanders' allies will likely see the group's role differently. When Priorities USA announced its recent fundraising haul of $50 million through January, Sanders repeatedly told supporters that he had raised \"zero dollars\" for super PACs.\nEvery Citizen Counts is expected to have a budget of at least $25 million, according to a presentation given to potential donors. Among its goals will be expanding voting access in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin.\nThe group already has a partnership with the National Democratic Voting Rights Trust, which has been involved in voting rights litigation in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Ohio. The trust is advised by prominent campaign lawyer Marc Elias, who serves as general counsel for Clinton's presidential campaign.\nSlides in a presentation provided to The Associated Press estimates that the group's litigation would protect the right to vote for 2 million voters in those four states, which will be among the most contested in the November election.\nCecil, who will serve as the organization's senior adviser, said he is putting together a team and advisory board that will oversee the group. He said the group was not aimed solely on the 2016 election but would be \"in this fight for the long haul.\"\n\"There have been too many efforts to restrict access to the polls, making it even more difficult to vote,\" he said. \"We will engage at all levels: pushing for stronger legislation around early voting, same-day registration and vote by mail, waging legal battles to roll back onerous laws and registering voters in underrepresented communities across the country.\"\n__\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter at: https://www.twitter.com/kthomasDC","gunning_fog_3":"12.0","flesch_3":"13.0","readability_3":"46.1","index_4":"63","title_4":"Hillary Clinton Sharpens Focus After Democratic Debate Tussles","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-sharpens-focus-after-democratic-debate-tussles.html","candidate_4":"Hillary Clinton","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"After a debate performance in which she painted Bernie Sanders as a fringe candidate whose policies bordered on fantasy, Hillary Clinton and her allies intensified the pressure on the Vermont senator on Friday, burnishing her embrace of President Obama and seeking to solidify her support among blacks.\n\nFollowing a stinging loss in New Hampshire this week, the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, the “super PAC” that supports her, have sharpened their focus on Mr. Sanders and the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Separately, they have invested in new rounds of advertising intended to blunt any momentum that Mr. Sanders might have gained from his landslide in New Hampshire.\n\nOn Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s team unveiled a new television ad that ties her to Mr. Obama on the issue of tightening gun laws — a perceived weakness of Mr. Sanders. It features the Rev. Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed in the Charleston church shooting, praising Mrs. Clinton for “standing with the president” on firearms restrictions.\n\nDespite the fact that Mrs. Clinton has led in most South Carolina polls, Priorities USA is also leaving nothing to chance there. The group announced on Friday that it is starting its largest advertising campaign to date on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf, investing $500,000 to spread the message on radio stations that the former secretary of state is the true heir to Mr. Obama’s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.\n\n“We need a president who will build on all that President Obama has done,” say the narrators of the ad, which will air in South Carolina communities with large black populations. “President Obama trusted Hillary Clinton to be America’s secretary of state. And we know Hillary Clinton has the vision and courage to help build an economy to support our communities.”\n\nMrs. Clinton is building on the lines of attack she used in Thursday’s Democratic debate in Milwaukee. She criticized Mr. Sanders for disparaging Mr. Obama’s record and accused him of being too narrowly focused on his central mission of breaking up the banks to be sufficiently concerned about issues such as civil rights and criminal justice reform.\n\nThe new push from Priorities USA could leave Mrs. Clinton open to more criticism from the Vermont senator, who has lamented her reliance on big donors as a sign that she is not independent. At the debate, Mrs. Clinton tried to separate herself from the group while also clinging to Mr. Obama.\n\n“You’re referring to a super PAC that we don’t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me,” Mrs. Clinton said in response to a question about what rich donors expect when they give money to political action committees. “They are the ones who should respond to any questions.”\n\nA spokesman for Priorities USA pointed out that super PACs support Mr. Sanders, even though he opposes them. Priorities USA is also spending $4.5 million across the South to turn out voters before several states there hold nominating contests on March 1.\n\nIn the days leading to the South Carolina voting, Mr. Sanders could also be looking for some new answers to tough questions, as Mrs. Clinton took a more aggressive approach to discrediting his foreign policy knowledge and credentials. In one of her more stinging debate blows, Mrs. Clinton said it was not clear to her who Mr. Sanders was seeking counsel from on international affairs.\n\nAsked to note any advisers, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, pointed to an essay published on the Politico magazine website on Thursday by Lawrence Korb, an assistant secretary of defense during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Although Mr. Korb has only met with Mr. Sanders once, he said he is “serious” on foreign policy.\n\n“In my dealings with him, and in analyzing his record in Congress over the past 25 years, I have found that Sanders has taken balanced, realistic positions on many of the most critical foreign policy issues facing the country,” Mr. Korb wrote.\n\nAs the Democrats jockey for position, Republicans, who hold their next presidential debate on Saturday, also have South Carolina on their minds. With their primary election being held a week earlier, on Feb. 20, the sniping among the remaining candidates has reached a fever pitch.\n\nOn Friday, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will gather at the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. They will look to court the evangelical Christians that could be crucial to their success in the state.\n\nDonald J. Trump is not attending the event, but as he faces a tight race with Mr. Cruz in South Carolina, he made sure to weigh in from afar. In a post on Twitter, he rebutted a suggestion made by the Texas senator that Mr. Trump agrees with Mr. Obama on same-sex marriage.\n\n“How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” Mr. Trump said.","gunning_fog_4":"7.6","flesch_4":"7.6","readability_4":"65.73","index_5":"68","title_5":"Pro-Clinton Super PAC Announces Large Fundraising Haul","url_5":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/29/pro-clinton-super-pac-announces-large-fundraising-haul/","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"The main super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said  it is sitting on a war chest of $44.7 million in cash following strong fundraising in the second half of the year, and has lined up tens of millions of dollars in additional commitments, giving Mrs. Clinton a financial advantage as primary season begins.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, said it raised a total of $40.95 million in full-year 2015, and has raised another $9.6 million in January, making its total raised at $50.6 million. The group said it has another $42 million in fundraising commitments, or pledges from its donors to contribute funds in the future.  The numbers were disclosed in a memo from the group’s chief strategist, Guy Cecil.\nSeparate from the super PAC, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has raised $112 million, making her likely the best-funded candidate in the race.   Mrs. Clinton’s primary challenger in the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders, has seen his fundraising accelerate in recent months, bringing in a haul of $75 million for full-year 2015.

Mr. Sanders has also been popular among labor unions.\nAmong Priorities top donors in the first half the year were a slew of billionaires, including financier Donald Sussman, global investor George Soros and media magnate Haim Saban.

When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5636363636363637},"q1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7000000000000001},"q2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5636363636363637},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q4":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.7363636363636362},"q5":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7000000000000001},"q6":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7000000000000001},"q7":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7363636363636362},"q8":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7363636363636362},"q9":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5636363636363637},"q10":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5636363636363637},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":0.7363636363636362},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"3049","confidence":0.5636363636363637},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":0.7000000000000001},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"bernie_sanders","confidence":0.4363636363636363}}}

Sanders about immigration issues.\"\nRomero is the latest in a string of endorsements touted by Sanders who didn't actually back the Vermont senator. \nTwo newspapers in New Hampshire that had not backed the senator were included in an ad titled \"Endorsed\" and last month in Iowa, an ad by the Sanders campaign included the Des Moines Register in a list of newspapers that have backed the senator. \nThe Register actually endorsed Clinton. \nWhat's more, the AARP and the League of Conservation Voters have said the Sanders campaign has used their logos in mailers without their permission.\nIn an emails provided by the Sanders campaign, Romero did agree to be part of the steering committee, telling a Sanders staffer that she would be \"honored to be part of this.\"\nThe email asking for Romero's support came from Erika Andiola, Sanders' Latino outreach strategist. In the email, Aniola told Romero she would \"be serving the campaign in an advisory capacity and offering feedback on how we can best connect with and mobilize support in the Latino community for the remaining life of the campaign.\"\nNowhere in the email exchange, though, does Romero agree to endorse Sanders. In fact, Romero asked not to have her title included in any campaign lists because as student body president, she has \"to stay neutral to candidates.\"\nBut because Romero has grown frustrated with the Sanders campaign, she said Monday that she is backing Clinton.\n\"I believe that Hillary has my back, and that she is the only candidate capable of accomplishing things in the face of Republican obstruction,\" Clinton said. \"She will get things done for immigrants families.\"\nAside from providing the emails with Romero, the Sanders campaign did not comment for this story.\nClinton, too, has dealt with touting endorsements that haven't actually happened. Two mayors -- one from Wilmington, Delaware, and another from San Antonio -- were among a list of 50 mayors that endorsed Clinton in October. But shortly after the list was released to the public, both mayors said they had yet to officially endorse the former secretary of state.\nSanders, who is currently leading in New Hampshire, is fighting to pick up ground on Clinton in Nevada, a state that most observers feel is more demographically suitable for her. While there has been a dearth of polling in the state, Clinton held a sizable lead, according to polls released late last year.\nClinton has picked up a number of top endorsements in the Silver State, including one earlier this month from Astrid Silva, possibly the nation's more recognizable DREAMer, an undocumented immigrant brought into the country as a child.\nSanders' campaign dismissed the Silva endorsement when the senator's press secretary for Latino outreach tweeted that Silva was a \"press hit\" for Clinton.\nRomero said Monday that the response to Silva factored into her decision to back Clinton.\n\"I'm also disappointed by the attacks from senior staffers on the Sanders campaign on Astrid Silva,\" she said. \"It shows how disconnected they are from Nevada, and they should apologize to her. There is no room for hate between DREAMers in this campaign.\"","gunning_fog_1":"10.4","flesch_1":"11.5","readability_1":"50.16","index_2":"27","title_2":"Sanders a prolific Dem fundraiser","url_2":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/index.html","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"CNN","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"Manchester , New Hampshire (CNN) Bernie Sanders complained on the campaign trail Friday that dialing for dollars \"affects your entire being.\"\nWhat he didn't mention: The Vermont senator and presidential candidate is a prolific fundraiser himself and has regularly benefited from the Democratic Party apparatus. \nIn recent years, Sanders has been billed as one of the hosts for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's retreats for the \"Majority Trust\" -- an elite group of top donors who give more than $30,000 per year -- at Martha's Vineyard in the summer and Palm Beach, Florida, in the winter. CNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011.\nThe retreats are typically attended by 100 or more donors who have either contributed the annual legal maximum of $33,400 to the DSCC, raised more than $100,000 for the party or both.  \nSanders has based his presidential campaign on a fire-and-brimstone critique of a broken campaign finance system -- and of Hillary Clinton for her reliance on big-dollar Wall Street donors. But Sanders is part of that system, and has helped Democrats court many of the same donors. \nDemocratic debate: 6 takeaways\nA Democratic lobbyist and donor who has attended the retreats told CNN that about 25% of the attendees there represent the financial sector -- and that Sanders and his wife, Jane, are always present. \n\"At each of the events all the senators speak. And I don't recall him ever giving a speech attacking us,\" the donor said. \"While progressive, his remarks were always in the mainstream of what you hear from senators.\" \nSanders' political leanings were well known by the donors who attended the retreats. \"Nobody was more surprised that Bernie was there than the donors were,\" said another Democrat who attended the retreats. \nHillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton stack late February with fundraisers\nBut Sanders maintains that members of Congress now spend far too much time making calls seeking campaign contributions -- or \"dialing for dollars,\" he said during a speech at the New England Council's \"Politics and Eggs\" event Friday morning.\n\"That's what they do. And not only should members who are elected be working for the people, not raising money -- if you think you could simply divide your brain in half, if you're working on unemployment or health care and think, now I've gotta go out and raise money, it affects your entire being,\" he said.\n\nSanders has been an Independent while in Congress, but has caucused with the Democrats since he was elected to the Senate in 2006, helping them maintain their majority for eight years. \nMichael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said Sanders has \"raised more money for the Senate Democrats than almost any other member of the Senate Democratic caucus\" because he sees helping the party regain the majority as critical.\n\"He has in the past written letters and helped Senate Democrats elect Democrats. He thinks that's very important to the country,\" Briggs said.\nDemocratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims\nHe got a hand from the party in 1996, when Rob Engel, then the political director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, pushed a Democratic contender out of the race for the House seat Sanders held as an independent.  \nIn 2006, when Sanders ran for the Senate, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pumped $37,300 into his race and included him in fundraising efforts for the party's Senate candidates. \nThe party also spent $60,000 on ads for Sanders, and contributed $100,000 to the Vermont Democratic Party -- which was behind Sanders even as he ran as an independent.  \nAmong the DSCC's top contributors that year: Goldman Sachs at $685,000, Citigroup at $326,000, Morgan Stanley at $260,000 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. at $207,000. \nDuring that 2006 campaign, Sanders attended a fundraiser at the Cambridge, Massachusetts home of Abby Rockefeller -- a member of the same family whose wealth he had one proposed confiscating. \nTwo years later, when then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama was being nominated at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, Sanders was among the senators who met with Sen. Chuck Schumer's \"Legacy Circle\" donors who had given the legal maximum to the DSCC five years in a row or $500,000 over their lifetimes. \nHe paid dues to the DSCC, too, with his Progressive Voters of America political action committee cutting checks for $30,000 to the group during the 2014 election cycle.  \nWhat 'progressive' means to Hillary Clinton vs. What 'progressive' means to Bernie Sanders\n\nSanders told the \"Politics and Eggs\" crowd that he favors a public financing system for elections, eliminating campaign contributions entirely. But his presidential campaign, just as Clinton's and Barack Obama's in 2008 and 2012, has chosen to bypass that system, allowing Sanders to raise millions of dollars more. \nHe has repeatedly touted his campaign's vast online fundraising apparatus, which has pulled in 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece, Sanders said Friday. \nPressed by MSNBC moderator Chuck Todd on why he hasn't accepted public financing in Thursday night's debate, Sanders said the system as it exists now is \"a disaster\" and \"very antiquated\" because it limits spending in early-voting primary states. \n\"The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work,\" Sanders said.","gunning_fog_2":"11.6","flesch_2":"11.5","readability_2":"55.58","index_3":"62","title_3":"Your Friday Evening Briefing: Hillary Clinton, Kanye West, Syria","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/nytnow/your-friday-evening-briefing-hillary-clinton-kanye-west-syria.html","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_3":"(Want to get this briefing by email?

The presidential candidates turned their focus to South Carolina, where the Republicans’ primary comes Feb. 20 and the Democrats’ a week later. Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz courted evangelicals at Bob Jones University. Donald Trump challenged his chief rival in the state via Twitter, “How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” A Cruz ad showed a boy explaining the features of a Trump action figure, saying, “He pretends to be a Republican.“\n\n_____\n\n2. Hillary Clinton also unrolled a new ad, one that ties her to President Obama in supporting tighter gun laws, an issue many Democrats see as a vulnerability for Bernie Sanders. And at a campaign event in South Carolina, she said Mr. Sanders “has called the president weak, a disappointment. He does not support, the way I do, building on the progress the president has made.” A “super PAC,” Priorities USA, has a $500,000 campaign of radio ads stressing her leadership in helping blacks.\n\n_____\n\n3. Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, tried to douse the fire set by her comment about Bernie Sanders supporters, “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” In an essay in The Times, she wrote, “I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line.”\n\n_____\n\n4. The widening gap between rich and poor, one of the most powerful themes of the presidential campaigns, includes a disturbing disparity in life spans. New research looking at both ends of the income spectrum showed that the gap, which has not been fully explained, has more than doubled since the 1970s, to about 14 years. “This may be the next frontier of the inequality discussion,” one analyst said.\n\n_____\n\n5. Pope and patriarch sat down together, the first time that the leaders of the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches met since the branches splintered nearly 1,000 years ago. “Now things are easier,” Patriarch Kirill said. “It is clear now that this is the will of God,” Pope Francis responded.\n\n_____\n\n6. Major League Baseball issued its first lifetime ban over performance-enhancing drugs, banishing the Mets pitcher Jenrry Mejia after he tested positive for a third time.\n\n_____\n\n7. The family of a man killed in the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project saluted the jury that convicted a New York City police officer, Peter Liang, of manslaughter. “There are many more police officers who need to be held accountable,” the family said in a statement. “We hope this case will send a message to all N.Y.P.D. officers and police departments around the country and around the world that they can’t kill and get away with it anymore.”\n\n_____\n\n8. The hatchet Kanye West and Taylor Swift buried a few years ago got disinterred. A day after Mr. West’s fashion show/album release sold out Madison Square Garden, he added a song that included a sexual reference to Taylor Swift and claimed responsibility for her fame. Ms. Swift’s brother threw his Kanye-designed Yeezy sneakers in the trash and posted a video of the act on Instagram.\n\n_____\n\n9. The Rio Olympic Games are still six months away, but this Texas gymnast looks like a real possibility to win gold. Our sports columnist calls Simone Biles, 18 and not quite five feet tall, unfathomably powerful and “the best American gymnast since, well, probably ever.”\n\n_____\n\n10. The U.N. groped for details about how to create a “humanitarian task force” for Syria called for by a new cease-fire deal between the U.S. and Russia. But at the border with Turkey, some Syrians doubted the bombing would end. “The deals they make there are so isolated and detached from this reality here,” one said.\n\n_____\n\n11. Success Academy, a leader in New York City’s charter school movement, has long had critics of its methods for achieving a stellar record of performance on standardized tests. Now there’s concern that some teachers become emotionally abusive, after a video emerged showing one mercilessly berating a first grader for a wrong answer. In interviews, other teachers said demeaning of children was a regular occurrence.\n\n_____\n\n12. Lastly, over the long Presidents’ Day weekend, the public is invited to help with the Great Backyard Bird Count.

With just a few days before polling booths open up on Tuesday, voters are still shopping around to make their final decision.\nAfter delivering his stump speech, the first man to ask a question lit into Trump for mocking a reporter with a disability late last year -- something Trump denies doing.\nThe voter identified himself as a longtime boxing fan and drew an analogy comparing the rivalry between Trump and Bush to a famous boxing match in 1980 between John Tate and Mike Weaver, in which Weaver was losing for 14 rounds until he came back in the 15th round to knock out Tate. \n\"Governor, you're Mike Weaver,\" the man said. \"Throw that punch tonight.\"\nAfter the crowd erupted in agreement, Bush highlighted his own record of helping people with disabilities, and as he's been doing for weeks, lambasted Trump for what he calls his habit of \"disparaging\" people, suggesting this time that his rival candidate needs a visit to the couch.  \n\"It's just ridiculous. It's a sign of deep insecurity. I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but the guy needs therapy,\" Bush said to applause and laughter.\nBush also had some criticism for his other rivals ahead of Saturday night's debate on ABC News. The former Florida governor mocked Sen. Ted Cruz's proposal to \"carpet bomb\" ISIS, saying that's an old school technique and the military has precise weaponry that eliminates the need to carpet bomb.\nHe then turned to Trump's proposal. \"Or say that you are going to bomb the S-H-blank-blank out of ISIS? Really? Is that a serious thought?\"\nIn a not-so-subtle knock against Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio -- both first-term senators -- Bush made his pitch that the country needs an experienced leader. \"We're living in dangerous times. We're not running for the back bench of the United States Senate, we're running for the presidency of the United States,\" he said. \"And you need to have someone who knows what he's doing.\"\nThe more candid Bush also offered a blunt rebuttal to one voter's question about Bush's last name. The young woman said she was a big fan of the family, but asked how can Bush persuade other millennials who are opposed to another Bush in the White House.\nThe candidate referenced his campaign's college network that spans hundreds of campus, but then grew more forthright in his rhetoric about his last name.\n\"The Bush thing, people are just going to have to get over it, alright?\" he said to big applause.\nBush, as he's been doing lately, said he's been characterized as an \"establishment\" candidate because his father and brother were both presidents.\n\"I got no problems with this,\" he said. \"And people that do, they either need to get therapy themselves or realize that we can change the course of this country working together to solve problems.\"\nTo show his embrace of his last name, Bush brought out his mother, Barbara Bush, on the campaign trail this week, and his brother is set to campaign with him in South Carolina before the state's primary later this month.  \nBut Bush's answer wasn't the first time his brother or father's name came up at the event. Earlier, Bush was being introduced by Tom Ridge, and the former Homeland Security Secretary slipped up, saying \"George Bush\" instead of \"Jeb Bush.\"\n\"By the way, I worked for his brother and I love his dad, so excuse me for the mess-up because I think this is a legacy of principled leadership and that's exactly what Jeb Bush would bring to the White House,\" Ridge said.\n\nDespite all the tough talk about his rivals, Bush also showed a softer side on Saturday. When he was asked about drug addiction -- a huge problem in New Hampshire -- Bush signaled he was about to share his daughter's story about her former struggle with the issue. But he paused.\n\"OK, I've not done this next to Columba,\" he said, before he walked over to his wife, who was sitting in the front row, to briefly grab her hand.\nThen he paused again, looked at his feet, and started choking up as he began to talk about how Noelle \"spiraled out of control\" more than a decade ago. It's a story he shares often, and he's even done it with his daughter in attendance. But Saturday marked the first time that he grew emotional in front of an audience when talking about it.\nIt's also the second time in the past few days that Bush choked up at a town hall. He struggled Thursday night as well when his mother was at an event in Derry and Bush mentioned his \"idyllic\" father, whose health makes it difficult for him to make public appearances.\nAside from his emotional moment on Saturday, Bush also had some fun with the audience. He praised the voters for asking \"real\" questions, winning laughs and applause when he said \"the questions on the debate stage will be probably really stupid to be honest with you.\"\nHe also defended his Super Bowl pick of the Denver Broncos because he's a fan of Peyton Manning. After some in the New England crowd moaned and groaned -- this is Patriots country -- Bush protested.\n\"Hey, just a second here\" he said, playfully putting his foot down. \"I'm for Peyton Manning because he's for me.\"\nAs the audience went wild, Bush had one more thing to add: \"He's also managed to be the, uh, the adult in the room -- kinda like me.\"","gunning_fog_4":"10.0","flesch_4":"8.7","readability_4":"68.1","index_5":"10","title_5":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Promises to Keep Pressing the Campaign","url_5":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-promises-to-keep-pressing-the-campaign/","candidate_5":"Bernie Sanders","org_5":"The New York Times","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"BOSTON — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed on Monday night that no matter the outcome of the Super Tuesday races, his campaign would continue to rally voters against a political establishment that is largely backing his rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Sanders, standing next to a chartered plane here, said he would “likely” win Vermont’s vote, and also felt good about his chances for winning the most delegates in Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts. He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.\n\n“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”\n\nMr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. \n\n“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”\n\nStill, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.\n\n“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote. They do that very well.”\n\nMr. Sanders went on to repeat criticisms of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to several industries and to cast himself as a candidate more interested in reforming campaign finance laws and dealing with income inequality. To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay’s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for “The Big Short,” a movie about the failure of the banking industry.\n\n“As Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. \n\nMr. Sanders also said that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he didn’t think “real change” comes from someone taking money from such industries and that instead, such change would come from millions of people demanding “a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent.”","gunning_fog_5":"10.0","flesch_5":"8.7","readability_5":"68.1","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination","gold_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html?_r=0","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The New York Times","gold_body":"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.6875,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T04:18:14+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952968934,"created_at":"2016-04-08T03:44:21+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T03:41:28+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"coinworker","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"Berkeley","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915118,"worker_id":33935063,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.878258941461764,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"-1","q2":"0","q3":"0","q4":"0","q5":"0","q6":"0","q7":"-1","q8":"0","q9":"1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"12","index_1":"28","title_1":"Sanders campaign touts another endorsement that didn't happen","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/11/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-dreamer-support/index.html","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"(CNN) Once again, the Bernie Sanders' campaign finds itself having claimed the support of someone who didn't exactly endorse the Vermont senator.\nBrenda Romero, a Nevada student leader and DREAMer that Bernie Sanders' campaign touted as someone who endorsed their campaign, tells CNN she never endorsed the Vermont senator and is backing Hillary Clinton.\nRomero said Monday she had agreed to be part of Sanders' Nevada Latino Steering Committee, but that she never endorsed the senator.\nSanders released the list of activists and elected officials on his Latino committee in January. \n\"Tomorrow, a group of highly respected community leaders will announce their support for Bernie Sanders for president,\" said a statement about the press conference. \nThe list included Lucy Flores, former Nevada state assemblywoman and congressional candidate, and Romero, a undocumented DREAMer and class president at College of Southern Nevada.\n\"I didn't agree to such an endorsement,\" Romero said Monday, noting that while she agreed to be part of the steering committee, she was told that the role would be advising the \"campaign and potentially Sen. Sanders about immigration issues.\"\nRomero is the latest in a string of endorsements touted by Sanders who didn't actually back the Vermont senator. \nTwo newspapers in New Hampshire that had not backed the senator were included in an ad titled \"Endorsed\" and last month in Iowa, an ad by the Sanders campaign included the Des Moines Register in a list of newspapers that have backed the senator. \nThe Register actually endorsed Clinton. \nWhat's more, the AARP and the League of Conservation Voters have said the Sanders campaign has used their logos in mailers without their permission.\nIn an emails provided by the Sanders campaign, Romero did agree to be part of the steering committee, telling a Sanders staffer that she would be \"honored to be part of this.\"\nThe email asking for Romero's support came from Erika Andiola, Sanders' Latino outreach strategist. In the email, Aniola told Romero she would \"be serving the campaign in an advisory capacity and offering feedback on how we can best connect with and mobilize support in the Latino community for the remaining life of the campaign.\"\nNowhere in the email exchange, though, does Romero agree to endorse Sanders. In fact, Romero asked not to have her title included in any campaign lists because as student body president, she has \"to stay neutral to candidates.\"\nBut because Romero has grown frustrated with the Sanders campaign, she said Monday that she is backing Clinton.\n\"I believe that Hillary has my back, and that she is the only candidate capable of accomplishing things in the face of Republican obstruction,\" Clinton said. \"She will get things done for immigrants families.\"\nAside from providing the emails with Romero, the Sanders campaign did not comment for this story.\nClinton, too, has dealt with touting endorsements that haven't actually happened. Two mayors -- one from Wilmington, Delaware, and another from San Antonio -- were among a list of 50 mayors that endorsed Clinton in October. But shortly after the list was released to the public, both mayors said they had yet to officially endorse the former secretary of state.\nSanders, who is currently leading in New Hampshire, is fighting to pick up ground on Clinton in Nevada, a state that most observers feel is more demographically suitable for her. While there has been a dearth of polling in the state, Clinton held a sizable lead, according to polls released late last year.\nClinton has picked up a number of top endorsements in the Silver State, including one earlier this month from Astrid Silva, possibly the nation's more recognizable DREAMer, an undocumented immigrant brought into the country as a child.\nSanders' campaign dismissed the Silva endorsement when the senator's press secretary for Latino outreach tweeted that Silva was a \"press hit\" for Clinton.\nRomero said Monday that the response to Silva factored into her decision to back Clinton.\n\"I'm also disappointed by the attacks from senior staffers on the Sanders campaign on Astrid Silva,\" she said. \"It shows how disconnected they are from Nevada, and they should apologize to her. There is no room for hate between DREAMers in this campaign.\"","gunning_fog_1":"10.4","flesch_1":"11.5","readability_1":"50.16","index_2":"27","title_2":"Sanders a prolific Dem fundraiser","url_2":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/index.html","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"CNN","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"Manchester , New Hampshire (CNN) Bernie Sanders complained on the campaign trail Friday that dialing for dollars \"affects your entire being.\"\nWhat he didn't mention: The Vermont senator and presidential candidate is a prolific fundraiser himself and has regularly benefited from the Democratic Party apparatus. \nIn recent years, Sanders has been billed as one of the hosts for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's retreats for the \"Majority Trust\" -- an elite group of top donors who give more than $30,000 per year -- at Martha's Vineyard in the summer and Palm Beach, Florida, in the winter. CNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011.\nThe retreats are typically attended by 100 or more donors who have either contributed the annual legal maximum of $33,400 to the DSCC, raised more than $100,000 for the party or both.  \nSanders has based his presidential campaign on a fire-and-brimstone critique of a broken campaign finance system -- and of Hillary Clinton for her reliance on big-dollar Wall Street donors. But Sanders is part of that system, and has helped Democrats court many of the same donors. \nDemocratic debate: 6 takeaways\nA Democratic lobbyist and donor who has attended the retreats told CNN that about 25% of the attendees there represent the financial sector -- and that Sanders and his wife, Jane, are always present. \n\"At each of the events all the senators speak. And I don't recall him ever giving a speech attacking us,\" the donor said. \"While progressive, his remarks were always in the mainstream of what you hear from senators.\" \nSanders' political leanings were well known by the donors who attended the retreats. \"Nobody was more surprised that Bernie was there than the donors were,\" said another Democrat who attended the retreats. \nHillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton stack late February with fundraisers\nBut Sanders maintains that members of Congress now spend far too much time making calls seeking campaign contributions -- or \"dialing for dollars,\" he said during a speech at the New England Council's \"Politics and Eggs\" event Friday morning.\n\"That's what they do. And not only should members who are elected be working for the people, not raising money -- if you think you could simply divide your brain in half, if you're working on unemployment or health care and think, now I've gotta go out and raise money, it affects your entire being,\" he said.\n\nSanders has been an Independent while in Congress, but has caucused with the Democrats since he was elected to the Senate in 2006, helping them maintain their majority for eight years. \nMichael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said Sanders has \"raised more money for the Senate Democrats than almost any other member of the Senate Democratic caucus\" because he sees helping the party regain the majority as critical.\n\"He has in the past written letters and helped Senate Democrats elect Democrats. He thinks that's very important to the country,\" Briggs said.\nDemocratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims\nHe got a hand from the party in 1996, when Rob Engel, then the political director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, pushed a Democratic contender out of the race for the House seat Sanders held as an independent.  \nIn 2006, when Sanders ran for the Senate, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pumped $37,300 into his race and included him in fundraising efforts for the party's Senate candidates. \nThe party also spent $60,000 on ads for Sanders, and contributed $100,000 to the Vermont Democratic Party -- which was behind Sanders even as he ran as an independent.  \nAmong the DSCC's top contributors that year: Goldman Sachs at $685,000, Citigroup at $326,000, Morgan Stanley at $260,000 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. at $207,000. \nDuring that 2006 campaign, Sanders attended a fundraiser at the Cambridge, Massachusetts home of Abby Rockefeller -- a member of the same family whose wealth he had one proposed confiscating. \nTwo years later, when then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama was being nominated at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, Sanders was among the senators who met with Sen. Chuck Schumer's \"Legacy Circle\" donors who had given the legal maximum to the DSCC five years in a row or $500,000 over their lifetimes. \nHe paid dues to the DSCC, too, with his Progressive Voters of America political action committee cutting checks for $30,000 to the group during the 2014 election cycle.  \nWhat 'progressive' means to Hillary Clinton vs. What 'progressive' means to Bernie Sanders\n\nSanders told the \"Politics and Eggs\" crowd that he favors a public financing system for elections, eliminating campaign contributions entirely. But his presidential campaign, just as Clinton's and Barack Obama's in 2008 and 2012, has chosen to bypass that system, allowing Sanders to raise millions of dollars more. \nHe has repeatedly touted his campaign's vast online fundraising apparatus, which has pulled in 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece, Sanders said Friday. \nPressed by MSNBC moderator Chuck Todd on why he hasn't accepted public financing in Thursday night's debate, Sanders said the system as it exists now is \"a disaster\" and \"very antiquated\" because it limits spending in early-voting primary states. \n\"The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work,\" Sanders said.","gunning_fog_2":"11.6","flesch_2":"11.5","readability_2":"55.58","index_3":"62","title_3":"Your Friday Evening Briefing: Hillary Clinton, Kanye West, Syria","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/nytnow/your-friday-evening-briefing-hillary-clinton-kanye-west-syria.html","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_3":"(Want to get this briefing by email?

The presidential candidates turned their focus to South Carolina, where the Republicans’ primary comes Feb. 20 and the Democrats’ a week later. Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz courted evangelicals at Bob Jones University. Donald Trump challenged his chief rival in the state via Twitter, “How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” A Cruz ad showed a boy explaining the features of a Trump action figure, saying, “He pretends to be a Republican.“\n\n_____\n\n2. Hillary Clinton also unrolled a new ad, one that ties her to President Obama in supporting tighter gun laws, an issue many Democrats see as a vulnerability for Bernie Sanders. And at a campaign event in South Carolina, she said Mr. Sanders “has called the president weak, a disappointment. He does not support, the way I do, building on the progress the president has made.” A “super PAC,” Priorities USA, has a $500,000 campaign of radio ads stressing her leadership in helping blacks.\n\n_____\n\n3. Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, tried to douse the fire set by her comment about Bernie Sanders supporters, “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” In an essay in The Times, she wrote, “I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line.”\n\n_____\n\n4. The widening gap between rich and poor, one of the most powerful themes of the presidential campaigns, includes a disturbing disparity in life spans. New research looking at both ends of the income spectrum showed that the gap, which has not been fully explained, has more than doubled since the 1970s, to about 14 years. “This may be the next frontier of the inequality discussion,” one analyst said.\n\n_____\n\n5. Pope and patriarch sat down together, the first time that the leaders of the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches met since the branches splintered nearly 1,000 years ago. “Now things are easier,” Patriarch Kirill said. “It is clear now that this is the will of God,” Pope Francis responded.\n\n_____\n\n6. Major League Baseball issued its first lifetime ban over performance-enhancing drugs, banishing the Mets pitcher Jenrry Mejia after he tested positive for a third time.\n\n_____\n\n7. The family of a man killed in the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project saluted the jury that convicted a New York City police officer, Peter Liang, of manslaughter. “There are many more police officers who need to be held accountable,” the family said in a statement. “We hope this case will send a message to all N.Y.P.D. officers and police departments around the country and around the world that they can’t kill and get away with it anymore.”\n\n_____\n\n8. The hatchet Kanye West and Taylor Swift buried a few years ago got disinterred. A day after Mr. West’s fashion show/album release sold out Madison Square Garden, he added a song that included a sexual reference to Taylor Swift and claimed responsibility for her fame. Ms. Swift’s brother threw his Kanye-designed Yeezy sneakers in the trash and posted a video of the act on Instagram.\n\n_____\n\n9. The Rio Olympic Games are still six months away, but this Texas gymnast looks like a real possibility to win gold. Our sports columnist calls Simone Biles, 18 and not quite five feet tall, unfathomably powerful and “the best American gymnast since, well, probably ever.”\n\n_____\n\n10. The U.N. groped for details about how to create a “humanitarian task force” for Syria called for by a new cease-fire deal between the U.S. and Russia. But at the border with Turkey, some Syrians doubted the bombing would end. “The deals they make there are so isolated and detached from this reality here,” one said.\n\n_____\n\n11. Success Academy, a leader in New York City’s charter school movement, has long had critics of its methods for achieving a stellar record of performance on standardized tests. Now there’s concern that some teachers become emotionally abusive, after a video emerged showing one mercilessly berating a first grader for a wrong answer. In interviews, other teachers said demeaning of children was a regular occurrence.\n\n_____\n\n12. Lastly, over the long Presidents’ Day weekend, the public is invited to help with the Great Backyard Bird Count. Last year, 140,000 people in more than 100 countries classified nearly half of the world’s bird types during the four-day event.

With just a few days before polling booths open up on Tuesday, voters are still shopping around to make their final decision.\nAfter delivering his stump speech, the first man to ask a question lit into Trump for mocking a reporter with a disability late last year -- something Trump denies doing.\nThe voter identified himself as a longtime boxing fan and drew an analogy comparing the rivalry between Trump and Bush to a famous boxing match in 1980 between John Tate and Mike Weaver, in which Weaver was losing for 14 rounds until he came back in the 15th round to knock out Tate. \n\"Governor, you're Mike Weaver,\" the man said. \"Throw that punch tonight.\"\nAfter the crowd erupted in agreement, Bush highlighted his own record of helping people with disabilities, and as he's been doing for weeks, lambasted Trump for what he calls his habit of \"disparaging\" people, suggesting this time that his rival candidate needs a visit to the couch.  \n\"It's just ridiculous. It's a sign of deep insecurity. I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but the guy needs therapy,\" Bush said to applause and laughter.\nBush also had some criticism for his other rivals ahead of Saturday night's debate on ABC News. The former Florida governor mocked Sen. Ted Cruz's proposal to \"carpet bomb\" ISIS, saying that's an old school technique and the military has precise weaponry that eliminates the need to carpet bomb.\nHe then turned to Trump's proposal. \"Or say that you are going to bomb the S-H-blank-blank out of ISIS? Really? Is that a serious thought?\"\nIn a not-so-subtle knock against Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio -- both first-term senators -- Bush made his pitch that the country needs an experienced leader. \"We're living in dangerous times. We're not running for the back bench of the United States Senate, we're running for the presidency of the United States,\" he said. \"And you need to have someone who knows what he's doing.\"\nThe more candid Bush also offered a blunt rebuttal to one voter's question about Bush's last name. The young woman said she was a big fan of the family, but asked how can Bush persuade other millennials who are opposed to another Bush in the White House.\nThe candidate referenced his campaign's college network that spans hundreds of campus, but then grew more forthright in his rhetoric about his last name.\n\"The Bush thing, people are just going to have to get over it, alright?\" he said to big applause.\nBush, as he's been doing lately, said he's been characterized as an \"establishment\" candidate because his father and brother were both presidents.\n\"I got no problems with this,\" he said. \"And people that do, they either need to get therapy themselves or realize that we can change the course of this country working together to solve problems.\"\nTo show his embrace of his last name, Bush brought out his mother, Barbara Bush, on the campaign trail this week, and his brother is set to campaign with him in South Carolina before the state's primary later this month.  \nBut Bush's answer wasn't the first time his brother or father's name came up at the event. Earlier, Bush was being introduced by Tom Ridge, and the former Homeland Security Secretary slipped up, saying \"George Bush\" instead of \"Jeb Bush.\"\n\"By the way, I worked for his brother and I love his dad, so excuse me for the mess-up because I think this is a legacy of principled leadership and that's exactly what Jeb Bush would bring to the White House,\" Ridge said.\n\nDespite all the tough talk about his rivals, Bush also showed a softer side on Saturday. When he was asked about drug addiction -- a huge problem in New Hampshire -- Bush signaled he was about to share his daughter's story about her former struggle with the issue. But he paused.\n\"OK, I've not done this next to Columba,\" he said, before he walked over to his wife, who was sitting in the front row, to briefly grab her hand.\nThen he paused again, looked at his feet, and started choking up as he began to talk about how Noelle \"spiraled out of control\" more than a decade ago. It's a story he shares often, and he's even done it with his daughter in attendance. But Saturday marked the first time that he grew emotional in front of an audience when talking about it.\nIt's also the second time in the past few days that Bush choked up at a town hall. He struggled Thursday night as well when his mother was at an event in Derry and Bush mentioned his \"idyllic\" father, whose health makes it difficult for him to make public appearances.\nAside from his emotional moment on Saturday, Bush also had some fun with the audience. He praised the voters for asking \"real\" questions, winning laughs and applause when he said \"the questions on the debate stage will be probably really stupid to be honest with you.\"\nHe also defended his Super Bowl pick of the Denver Broncos because he's a fan of Peyton Manning. After some in the New England crowd moaned and groaned -- this is Patriots country -- Bush protested.\n\"Hey, just a second here\" he said, playfully putting his foot down. \"I'm for Peyton Manning because he's for me.\"\nAs the audience went wild, Bush had one more thing to add: \"He's also managed to be the, uh, the adult in the room -- kinda like me.\"","gunning_fog_4":"10.0","flesch_4":"8.7","readability_4":"68.1","index_5":"10","title_5":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Promises to Keep Pressing the Campaign","url_5":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-promises-to-keep-pressing-the-campaign/","candidate_5":"Bernie Sanders","org_5":"The New York Times","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"BOSTON — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed on Monday night that no matter the outcome of the Super Tuesday races, his campaign would continue to rally voters against a political establishment that is largely backing his rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Sanders, standing next to a chartered plane here, said he would “likely” win Vermont’s vote, and also felt good about his chances for winning the most delegates in Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts. He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.\n\n“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”\n\nMr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. \n\n“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”\n\nStill, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.\n\n“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote. They do that very well.”\n\nMr. Sanders went on to repeat criticisms of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to several industries and to cast himself as a candidate more interested in reforming campaign finance laws and dealing with income inequality. To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay’s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for “The Big Short,” a movie about the failure of the banking industry.\n\n“As Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. \n\nMr. Sanders also said that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he didn’t think “real change” comes from someone taking money from such industries and that instead, such change would come from millions of people demanding “a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent.”","gunning_fog_5":"10.0","flesch_5":"8.7","readability_5":"68.1","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination","gold_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html?_r=0","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The New York Times","gold_body":"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}},{"id":1952974919,"created_at":"2016-04-08T03:56:30+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T03:37:55+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"TX","city":"Dallas","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915118,"worker_id":36807032,"trust":0.6875,"worker_trust":0.9375,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"2","q1":"-1","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"2","q5":"0","q6":"2","q7":"-1","q8":"0","q9":"0","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"donald_trump"},"unit_data":{"nil":"12","index_1":"28","title_1":"Sanders campaign touts another endorsement that didn't happen","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/11/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-dreamer-support/index.html","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"(CNN) Once again, the Bernie Sanders' campaign finds itself having claimed the support of someone who didn't exactly endorse the Vermont senator.\nBrenda Romero, a Nevada student leader and DREAMer that Bernie Sanders' campaign touted as someone who endorsed their campaign, tells CNN she never endorsed the Vermont senator and is backing Hillary Clinton.\nRomero said Monday she had agreed to be part of Sanders' Nevada Latino Steering Committee, but that she never endorsed the senator.\nSanders released the list of activists and elected officials on his Latino committee in January. \n\"Tomorrow, a group of highly respected community leaders will announce their support for Bernie Sanders for president,\" said a statement about the press conference. \nThe list included Lucy Flores, former Nevada state assemblywoman and congressional candidate, and Romero, a undocumented DREAMer and class president at College of Southern Nevada.\n\"I didn't agree to such an endorsement,\" Romero said Monday, noting that while she agreed to be part of the steering committee, she was told that the role would be advising the \"campaign and potentially Sen. Sanders about immigration issues.\"\nRomero is the latest in a string of endorsements touted by Sanders who didn't actually back the Vermont senator. \nTwo newspapers in New Hampshire that had not backed the senator were included in an ad titled \"Endorsed\" and last month in Iowa, an ad by the Sanders campaign included the Des Moines Register in a list of newspapers that have backed the senator. \nThe Register actually endorsed Clinton. \nWhat's more, the AARP and the League of Conservation Voters have said the Sanders campaign has used their logos in mailers without their permission.\nIn an emails provided by the Sanders campaign, Romero did agree to be part of the steering committee, telling a Sanders staffer that she would be \"honored to be part of this.\"\nThe email asking for Romero's support came from Erika Andiola, Sanders' Latino outreach strategist. In the email, Aniola told Romero she would \"be serving the campaign in an advisory capacity and offering feedback on how we can best connect with and mobilize support in the Latino community for the remaining life of the campaign.\"\nNowhere in the email exchange, though, does Romero agree to endorse Sanders. In fact, Romero asked not to have her title included in any campaign lists because as student body president, she has \"to stay neutral to candidates.\"\nBut because Romero has grown frustrated with the Sanders campaign, she said Monday that she is backing Clinton.\n\"I believe that Hillary has my back, and that she is the only candidate capable of accomplishing things in the face of Republican obstruction,\" Clinton said. \"She will get things done for immigrants families.\"\nAside from providing the emails with Romero, the Sanders campaign did not comment for this story.\nClinton, too, has dealt with touting endorsements that haven't actually happened. Two mayors -- one from Wilmington, Delaware, and another from San Antonio -- were among a list of 50 mayors that endorsed Clinton in October. But shortly after the list was released to the public, both mayors said they had yet to officially endorse the former secretary of state.\nSanders, who is currently leading in New Hampshire, is fighting to pick up ground on Clinton in Nevada, a state that most observers feel is more demographically suitable for her. While there has been a dearth of polling in the state, Clinton held a sizable lead, according to polls released late last year.\nClinton has picked up a number of top endorsements in the Silver State, including one earlier this month from Astrid Silva, possibly the nation's more recognizable DREAMer, an undocumented immigrant brought into the country as a child.\nSanders' campaign dismissed the Silva endorsement when the senator's press secretary for Latino outreach tweeted that Silva was a \"press hit\" for Clinton.\nRomero said Monday that the response to Silva factored into her decision to back Clinton.\n\"I'm also disappointed by the attacks from senior staffers on the Sanders campaign on Astrid Silva,\" she said. \"It shows how disconnected they are from Nevada, and they should apologize to her. There is no room for hate between DREAMers in this campaign.\"","gunning_fog_1":"10.4","flesch_1":"11.5","readability_1":"50.16","index_2":"27","title_2":"Sanders a prolific Dem fundraiser","url_2":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/index.html","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"CNN","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"Manchester , New Hampshire (CNN) Bernie Sanders complained on the campaign trail Friday that dialing for dollars \"affects your entire being.\"\nWhat he didn't mention: The Vermont senator and presidential candidate is a prolific fundraiser himself and has regularly benefited from the Democratic Party apparatus. \nIn recent years, Sanders has been billed as one of the hosts for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's retreats for the \"Majority Trust\" -- an elite group of top donors who give more than $30,000 per year -- at Martha's Vineyard in the summer and Palm Beach, Florida, in the winter. CNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011.\nThe retreats are typically attended by 100 or more donors who have either contributed the annual legal maximum of $33,400 to the DSCC, raised more than $100,000 for the party or both.  \nSanders has based his presidential campaign on a fire-and-brimstone critique of a broken campaign finance system -- and of Hillary Clinton for her reliance on big-dollar Wall Street donors. But Sanders is part of that system, and has helped Democrats court many of the same donors. \nDemocratic debate: 6 takeaways\nA Democratic lobbyist and donor who has attended the retreats told CNN that about 25% of the attendees there represent the financial sector -- and that Sanders and his wife, Jane, are always present. \n\"At each of the events all the senators speak. And I don't recall him ever giving a speech attacking us,\" the donor said. \"While progressive, his remarks were always in the mainstream of what you hear from senators.\" \nSanders' political leanings were well known by the donors who attended the retreats. \"Nobody was more surprised that Bernie was there than the donors were,\" said another Democrat who attended the retreats. \nHillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton stack late February with fundraisers\nBut Sanders maintains that members of Congress now spend far too much time making calls seeking campaign contributions -- or \"dialing for dollars,\" he said during a speech at the New England Council's \"Politics and Eggs\" event Friday morning.\n\"That's what they do. And not only should members who are elected be working for the people, not raising money -- if you think you could simply divide your brain in half, if you're working on unemployment or health care and think, now I've gotta go out and raise money, it affects your entire being,\" he said.\n\nSanders has been an Independent while in Congress, but has caucused with the Democrats since he was elected to the Senate in 2006, helping them maintain their majority for eight years. \nMichael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said Sanders has \"raised more money for the Senate Democrats than almost any other member of the Senate Democratic caucus\" because he sees helping the party regain the majority as critical.\n\"He has in the past written letters and helped Senate Democrats elect Democrats. He thinks that's very important to the country,\" Briggs said.\nDemocratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims\nHe got a hand from the party in 1996, when Rob Engel, then the political director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, pushed a Democratic contender out of the race for the House seat Sanders held as an independent.  \nIn 2006, when Sanders ran for the Senate, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pumped $37,300 into his race and included him in fundraising efforts for the party's Senate candidates. \nThe party also spent $60,000 on ads for Sanders, and contributed $100,000 to the Vermont Democratic Party -- which was behind Sanders even as he ran as an independent.  \nAmong the DSCC's top contributors that year: Goldman Sachs at $685,000, Citigroup at $326,000, Morgan Stanley at $260,000 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. at $207,000. \nDuring that 2006 campaign, Sanders attended a fundraiser at the Cambridge, Massachusetts home of Abby Rockefeller -- a member of the same family whose wealth he had one proposed confiscating. \nTwo years later, when then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama was being nominated at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, Sanders was among the senators who met with Sen. Chuck Schumer's \"Legacy Circle\" donors who had given the legal maximum to the DSCC five years in a row or $500,000 over their lifetimes. \nHe paid dues to the DSCC, too, with his Progressive Voters of America political action committee cutting checks for $30,000 to the group during the 2014 election cycle.  \nWhat 'progressive' means to Hillary Clinton vs. What 'progressive' means to Bernie Sanders\n\nSanders told the \"Politics and Eggs\" crowd that he favors a public financing system for elections, eliminating campaign contributions entirely. But his presidential campaign, just as Clinton's and Barack Obama's in 2008 and 2012, has chosen to bypass that system, allowing Sanders to raise millions of dollars more. \nHe has repeatedly touted his campaign's vast online fundraising apparatus, which has pulled in 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece, Sanders said Friday. \nPressed by MSNBC moderator Chuck Todd on why he hasn't accepted public financing in Thursday night's debate, Sanders said the system as it exists now is \"a disaster\" and \"very antiquated\" because it limits spending in early-voting primary states. \n\"The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work,\" Sanders said.","gunning_fog_2":"11.6","flesch_2":"11.5","readability_2":"55.58","index_3":"62","title_3":"Your Friday Evening Briefing: Hillary Clinton, Kanye West, Syria","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/nytnow/your-friday-evening-briefing-hillary-clinton-kanye-west-syria.html","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_3":"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up. \n\nGood evening. Here’s the latest.\n\n1. The presidential candidates turned their focus to South Carolina, where the Republicans’ primary comes Feb. 20 and the Democrats’ a week later. Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz courted evangelicals at Bob Jones University. Donald Trump challenged his chief rival in the state via Twitter, “How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” A Cruz ad showed a boy explaining the features of a Trump action figure, saying, “He pretends to be a Republican.“\n\n_____\n\n2. Hillary Clinton also unrolled a new ad, one that ties her to President Obama in supporting tighter gun laws, an issue many Democrats see as a vulnerability for Bernie Sanders. And at a campaign event in South Carolina, she said Mr. Sanders “has called the president weak, a disappointment. He does not support, the way I do, building on the progress the president has made.” A “super PAC,” Priorities USA, has a $500,000 campaign of radio ads stressing her leadership in helping blacks.\n\n_____\n\n3. Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, tried to douse the fire set by her comment about Bernie Sanders supporters, “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” In an essay in The Times, she wrote, “I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line.”\n\n_____\n\n4. The widening gap between rich and poor, one of the most powerful themes of the presidential campaigns, includes a disturbing disparity in life spans. New research looking at both ends of the income spectrum showed that the gap, which has not been fully explained, has more than doubled since the 1970s, to about 14 years. “This may be the next frontier of the inequality discussion,” one analyst said.\n\n_____\n\n5. Pope and patriarch sat down together, the first time that the leaders of the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches met since the branches splintered nearly 1,000 years ago. “Now things are easier,” Patriarch Kirill said. “It is clear now that this is the will of God,” Pope Francis responded.\n\n_____\n\n6. Major League Baseball issued its first lifetime ban over performance-enhancing drugs, banishing the Mets pitcher Jenrry Mejia after he tested positive for a third time.\n\n_____\n\n7. The family of a man killed in the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project saluted the jury that convicted a New York City police officer, Peter Liang, of manslaughter. “There are many more police officers who need to be held accountable,” the family said in a statement. “We hope this case will send a message to all N.Y.P.D. officers and police departments around the country and around the world that they can’t kill and get away with it anymore.”\n\n_____\n\n8. The hatchet Kanye West and Taylor Swift buried a few years ago got disinterred. A day after Mr. West’s fashion show/album release sold out Madison Square Garden, he added a song that included a sexual reference to Taylor Swift and claimed responsibility for her fame. Ms. Swift’s brother threw his Kanye-designed Yeezy sneakers in the trash and posted a video of the act on Instagram.\n\n_____\n\n9. The Rio Olympic Games are still six months away, but this Texas gymnast looks like a real possibility to win gold. Our sports columnist calls Simone Biles, 18 and not quite five feet tall, unfathomably powerful and “the best American gymnast since, well, probably ever.”\n\n_____\n\n10. The U.N. groped for details about how to create a “humanitarian task force” for Syria called for by a new cease-fire deal between the U.S. and Russia. But at the border with Turkey, some Syrians doubted the bombing would end. “The deals they make there are so isolated and detached from this reality here,” one said.\n\n_____\n\n11. Success Academy, a leader in New York City’s charter school movement, has long had critics of its methods for achieving a stellar record of performance on standardized tests. Now there’s concern that some teachers become emotionally abusive, after a video emerged showing one mercilessly berating a first grader for a wrong answer. In interviews, other teachers said demeaning of children was a regular occurrence.\n\n_____\n\n12. Lastly, over the long Presidents’ Day weekend, the public is invited to help with the Great Backyard Bird Count. Last year, 140,000 people in more than 100 countries classified nearly half of the world’s bird types during the four-day event.

With just a few days before polling booths open up on Tuesday, voters are still shopping around to make their final decision.\nAfter delivering his stump speech, the first man to ask a question lit into Trump for mocking a reporter with a disability late last year -- something Trump denies doing.\nThe voter identified himself as a longtime boxing fan and drew an analogy comparing the rivalry between Trump and Bush to a famous boxing match in 1980 between John Tate and Mike Weaver, in which Weaver was losing for 14 rounds until he came back in the 15th round to knock out Tate. \n\"Governor, you're Mike Weaver,\" the man said. \"Throw that punch tonight.\"\nAfter the crowd erupted in agreement, Bush highlighted his own record of helping people with disabilities, and as he's been doing for weeks, lambasted Trump for what he calls his habit of \"disparaging\" people, suggesting this time that his rival candidate needs a visit to the couch.  \n\"It's just ridiculous. It's a sign of deep insecurity. I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but the guy needs therapy,\" Bush said to applause and laughter.\nBush also had some criticism for his other rivals ahead of Saturday night's debate on ABC News. The former Florida governor mocked Sen. Ted Cruz's proposal to \"carpet bomb\" ISIS, saying that's an old school technique and the military has precise weaponry that eliminates the need to carpet bomb.\nHe then turned to Trump's proposal. \"Or say that you are going to bomb the S-H-blank-blank out of ISIS? Really? Is that a serious thought?\"\nIn a not-so-subtle knock against Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio -- both first-term senators -- Bush made his pitch that the country needs an experienced leader. \"We're living in dangerous times. We're not running for the back bench of the United States Senate, we're running for the presidency of the United States,\" he said. \"And you need to have someone who knows what he's doing.\"\nThe more candid Bush also offered a blunt rebuttal to one voter's question about Bush's last name. The young woman said she was a big fan of the family, but asked how can Bush persuade other millennials who are opposed to another Bush in the White House.\nThe candidate referenced his campaign's college network that spans hundreds of campus, but then grew more forthright in his rhetoric about his last name.\n\"The Bush thing, people are just going to have to get over it, alright?\" he said to big applause.\nBush, as he's been doing lately, said he's been characterized as an \"establishment\" candidate because his father and brother were both presidents.\n\"I got no problems with this,\" he said. \"And people that do, they either need to get therapy themselves or realize that we can change the course of this country working together to solve problems.\"\nTo show his embrace of his last name, Bush brought out his mother, Barbara Bush, on the campaign trail this week, and his brother is set to campaign with him in South Carolina before the state's primary later this month.  \nBut Bush's answer wasn't the first time his brother or father's name came up at the event. Earlier, Bush was being introduced by Tom Ridge, and the former Homeland Security Secretary slipped up, saying \"George Bush\" instead of \"Jeb Bush.\"\n\"By the way, I worked for his brother and I love his dad, so excuse me for the mess-up because I think this is a legacy of principled leadership and that's exactly what Jeb Bush would bring to the White House,\" Ridge said.\n\nDespite all the tough talk about his rivals, Bush also showed a softer side on Saturday. When he was asked about drug addiction -- a huge problem in New Hampshire -- Bush signaled he was about to share his daughter's story about her former struggle with the issue. But he paused.\n\"OK, I've not done this next to Columba,\" he said, before he walked over to his wife, who was sitting in the front row, to briefly grab her hand.\nThen he paused again, looked at his feet, and started choking up as he began to talk about how Noelle \"spiraled out of control\" more than a decade ago. It's a story he shares often, and he's even done it with his daughter in attendance. But Saturday marked the first time that he grew emotional in front of an audience when talking about it.\nIt's also the second time in the past few days that Bush choked up at a town hall. He struggled Thursday night as well when his mother was at an event in Derry and Bush mentioned his \"idyllic\" father, whose health makes it difficult for him to make public appearances.\nAside from his emotional moment on Saturday, Bush also had some fun with the audience. He praised the voters for asking \"real\" questions, winning laughs and applause when he said \"the questions on the debate stage will be probably really stupid to be honest with you.\"\nHe also defended his Super Bowl pick of the Denver Broncos because he's a fan of Peyton Manning. After some in the New England crowd moaned and groaned -- this is Patriots country -- Bush protested.\n\"Hey, just a second here\" he said, playfully putting his foot down. \"I'm for Peyton Manning because he's for me.\"\nAs the audience went wild, Bush had one more thing to add: \"He's also managed to be the, uh, the adult in the room -- kinda like me.\"","gunning_fog_4":"10.0","flesch_4":"8.7","readability_4":"68.1","index_5":"10","title_5":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Promises to Keep Pressing the Campaign","url_5":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-promises-to-keep-pressing-the-campaign/","candidate_5":"Bernie Sanders","org_5":"The New York Times","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"BOSTON — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed on Monday night that no matter the outcome of the Super Tuesday races, his campaign would continue to rally voters against a political establishment that is largely backing his rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Sanders, standing next to a chartered plane here, said he would “likely” win Vermont’s vote, and also felt good about his chances for winning the most delegates in Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts. He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.\n\n“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”\n\nMr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. \n\n“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”\n\nStill, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.\n\n“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote. They do that very well.”\n\nMr. Sanders went on to repeat criticisms of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to several industries and to cast himself as a candidate more interested in reforming campaign finance laws and dealing with income inequality. To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay’s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for “The Big Short,” a movie about the failure of the banking industry.\n\n“As Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. \n\nMr. Sanders also said that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he didn’t think “real change” comes from someone taking money from such industries and that instead, such change would come from millions of people demanding “a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent.”","gunning_fog_5":"10.0","flesch_5":"8.7","readability_5":"68.1","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination","gold_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html?_r=0","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The New York Times","gold_body":"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}},{"id":1952983198,"created_at":"2016-04-08T04:18:04+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T04:15:38+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NJ","city":"Bergenfield","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915118,"worker_id":35701460,"trust":0.645833333333333,"worker_trust":0.944583333333333,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"0","q2":"0","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"0","q6":"0","q7":"1","q8":"0","q9":"-1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"12","index_1":"28","title_1":"Sanders campaign touts another endorsement that didn't happen","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/11/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-dreamer-support/index.html","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"(CNN) Once again, the Bernie Sanders' campaign finds itself having claimed the support of someone who didn't exactly endorse the Vermont senator.\nBrenda Romero, a Nevada student leader and DREAMer that Bernie Sanders' campaign touted as someone who endorsed their campaign, tells CNN she never endorsed the Vermont senator and is backing Hillary Clinton.\nRomero said Monday she had agreed to be part of Sanders' Nevada Latino Steering Committee, but that she never endorsed the senator.\nSanders released the list of activists and elected officials on his Latino committee in January. \n\"Tomorrow, a group of highly respected community leaders will announce their support for Bernie Sanders for president,\" said a statement about the press conference. \nThe list included Lucy Flores, former Nevada state assemblywoman and congressional candidate, and Romero, a undocumented DREAMer and class president at College of Southern Nevada.\n\"I didn't agree to such an endorsement,\" Romero said Monday, noting that while she agreed to be part of the steering committee, she was told that the role would be advising the \"campaign and potentially Sen. Sanders about immigration issues.\"\nRomero is the latest in a string of endorsements touted by Sanders who didn't actually back the Vermont senator. \nTwo newspapers in New Hampshire that had not backed the senator were included in an ad titled \"Endorsed\" and last month in Iowa, an ad by the Sanders campaign included the Des Moines Register in a list of newspapers that have backed the senator. \nThe Register actually endorsed Clinton. \nWhat's more, the AARP and the League of Conservation Voters have said the Sanders campaign has used their logos in mailers without their permission.\nIn an emails provided by the Sanders campaign, Romero did agree to be part of the steering committee, telling a Sanders staffer that she would be \"honored to be part of this.\"\nThe email asking for Romero's support came from Erika Andiola, Sanders' Latino outreach strategist. In the email, Aniola told Romero she would \"be serving the campaign in an advisory capacity and offering feedback on how we can best connect with and mobilize support in the Latino community for the remaining life of the campaign.\"\nNowhere in the email exchange, though, does Romero agree to endorse Sanders. In fact, Romero asked not to have her title included in any campaign lists because as student body president, she has \"to stay neutral to candidates.\"\nBut because Romero has grown frustrated with the Sanders campaign, she said Monday that she is backing Clinton.\n\"I believe that Hillary has my back, and that she is the only candidate capable of accomplishing things in the face of Republican obstruction,\" Clinton said. \"She will get things done for immigrants families.\"\nAside from providing the emails with Romero, the Sanders campaign did not comment for this story.\nClinton, too, has dealt with touting endorsements that haven't actually happened. Two mayors -- one from Wilmington, Delaware, and another from San Antonio -- were among a list of 50 mayors that endorsed Clinton in October. But shortly after the list was released to the public, both mayors said they had yet to officially endorse the former secretary of state.\nSanders, who is currently leading in New Hampshire, is fighting to pick up ground on Clinton in Nevada, a state that most observers feel is more demographically suitable for her. While there has been a dearth of polling in the state, Clinton held a sizable lead, according to polls released late last year.\nClinton has picked up a number of top endorsements in the Silver State, including one earlier this month from Astrid Silva, possibly the nation's more recognizable DREAMer, an undocumented immigrant brought into the country as a child.\nSanders' campaign dismissed the Silva endorsement when the senator's press secretary for Latino outreach tweeted that Silva was a \"press hit\" for Clinton.\nRomero said Monday that the response to Silva factored into her decision to back Clinton.\n\"I'm also disappointed by the attacks from senior staffers on the Sanders campaign on Astrid Silva,\" she said. \"It shows how disconnected they are from Nevada, and they should apologize to her. There is no room for hate between DREAMers in this campaign.\"","gunning_fog_1":"10.4","flesch_1":"11.5","readability_1":"50.16","index_2":"27","title_2":"Sanders a prolific Dem fundraiser","url_2":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/index.html","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"CNN","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"Manchester , New Hampshire (CNN) Bernie Sanders complained on the campaign trail Friday that dialing for dollars \"affects your entire being.\"\nWhat he didn't mention: The Vermont senator and presidential candidate is a prolific fundraiser himself and has regularly benefited from the Democratic Party apparatus. \nIn recent years, Sanders has been billed as one of the hosts for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's retreats for the \"Majority Trust\" -- an elite group of top donors who give more than $30,000 per year -- at Martha's Vineyard in the summer and Palm Beach, Florida, in the winter. CNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011.\nThe retreats are typically attended by 100 or more donors who have either contributed the annual legal maximum of $33,400 to the DSCC, raised more than $100,000 for the party or both.  \nSanders has based his presidential campaign on a fire-and-brimstone critique of a broken campaign finance system -- and of Hillary Clinton for her reliance on big-dollar Wall Street donors. But Sanders is part of that system, and has helped Democrats court many of the same donors. \nDemocratic debate: 6 takeaways\nA Democratic lobbyist and donor who has attended the retreats told CNN that about 25% of the attendees there represent the financial sector -- and that Sanders and his wife, Jane, are always present. \n\"At each of the events all the senators speak. And I don't recall him ever giving a speech attacking us,\" the donor said. \"While progressive, his remarks were always in the mainstream of what you hear from senators.\" \nSanders' political leanings were well known by the donors who attended the retreats. \"Nobody was more surprised that Bernie was there than the donors were,\" said another Democrat who attended the retreats. \nHillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton stack late February with fundraisers\nBut Sanders maintains that members of Congress now spend far too much time making calls seeking campaign contributions -- or \"dialing for dollars,\" he said during a speech at the New England Council's \"Politics and Eggs\" event Friday morning.\n\"That's what they do. And not only should members who are elected be working for the people, not raising money -- if you think you could simply divide your brain in half, if you're working on unemployment or health care and think, now I've gotta go out and raise money, it affects your entire being,\" he said.\n\nSanders has been an Independent while in Congress, but has caucused with the Democrats since he was elected to the Senate in 2006, helping them maintain their majority for eight years. \nMichael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said Sanders has \"raised more money for the Senate Democrats than almost any other member of the Senate Democratic caucus\" because he sees helping the party regain the majority as critical.\n\"He has in the past written letters and helped Senate Democrats elect Democrats. He thinks that's very important to the country,\" Briggs said.\nDemocratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims\nHe got a hand from the party in 1996, when Rob Engel, then the political director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, pushed a Democratic contender out of the race for the House seat Sanders held as an independent.  \nIn 2006, when Sanders ran for the Senate, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pumped $37,300 into his race and included him in fundraising efforts for the party's Senate candidates. \nThe party also spent $60,000 on ads for Sanders, and contributed $100,000 to the Vermont Democratic Party -- which was behind Sanders even as he ran as an independent.  \nAmong the DSCC's top contributors that year: Goldman Sachs at $685,000, Citigroup at $326,000, Morgan Stanley at $260,000 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. at $207,000. \nDuring that 2006 campaign, Sanders attended a fundraiser at the Cambridge, Massachusetts home of Abby Rockefeller -- a member of the same family whose wealth he had one proposed confiscating. \nTwo years later, when then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama was being nominated at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, Sanders was among the senators who met with Sen. Chuck Schumer's \"Legacy Circle\" donors who had given the legal maximum to the DSCC five years in a row or $500,000 over their lifetimes. \nHe paid dues to the DSCC, too, with his Progressive Voters of America political action committee cutting checks for $30,000 to the group during the 2014 election cycle.  \nWhat 'progressive' means to Hillary Clinton vs. What 'progressive' means to Bernie Sanders\n\nSanders told the \"Politics and Eggs\" crowd that he favors a public financing system for elections, eliminating campaign contributions entirely. But his presidential campaign, just as Clinton's and Barack Obama's in 2008 and 2012, has chosen to bypass that system, allowing Sanders to raise millions of dollars more. \nHe has repeatedly touted his campaign's vast online fundraising apparatus, which has pulled in 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece, Sanders said Friday. \nPressed by MSNBC moderator Chuck Todd on why he hasn't accepted public financing in Thursday night's debate, Sanders said the system as it exists now is \"a disaster\" and \"very antiquated\" because it limits spending in early-voting primary states. \n\"The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work,\" Sanders said.","gunning_fog_2":"11.6","flesch_2":"11.5","readability_2":"55.58","index_3":"62","title_3":"Your Friday Evening Briefing: Hillary Clinton, Kanye West, Syria","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/nytnow/your-friday-evening-briefing-hillary-clinton-kanye-west-syria.html","candidate_3":"Hillary Clinton","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_3":"(Want to get this briefing by email?

The presidential candidates turned their focus to South Carolina, where the Republicans’ primary comes Feb. 20 and the Democrats’ a week later. Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz courted evangelicals at Bob Jones University. Donald Trump challenged his chief rival in the state via Twitter, “How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” A Cruz ad showed a boy explaining the features of a Trump action figure, saying, “He pretends to be a Republican.“\n\n_____\n\n2. Hillary Clinton also unrolled a new ad, one that ties her to President Obama in supporting tighter gun laws, an issue many Democrats see as a vulnerability for Bernie Sanders. And at a campaign event in South Carolina, she said Mr. Sanders “has called the president weak, a disappointment. He does not support, the way I do, building on the progress the president has made.” A “super PAC,” Priorities USA, has a $500,000 campaign of radio ads stressing her leadership in helping blacks.\n\n_____\n\n3. Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, tried to douse the fire set by her comment about Bernie Sanders supporters, “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” In an essay in The Times, she wrote, “I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line.”\n\n_____\n\n4. The widening gap between rich and poor, one of the most powerful themes of the presidential campaigns, includes a disturbing disparity in life spans. New research looking at both ends of the income spectrum showed that the gap, which has not been fully explained, has more than doubled since the 1970s, to about 14 years. “This may be the next frontier of the inequality discussion,” one analyst said.\n\n_____\n\n5. Pope and patriarch sat down together, the first time that the leaders of the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches met since the branches splintered nearly 1,000 years ago. “Now things are easier,” Patriarch Kirill said. “It is clear now that this is the will of God,” Pope Francis responded.\n\n_____\n\n6. Major League Baseball issued its first lifetime ban over performance-enhancing drugs, banishing the Mets pitcher Jenrry Mejia after he tested positive for a third time.\n\n_____\n\n7. The family of a man killed in the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project saluted the jury that convicted a New York City police officer, Peter Liang, of manslaughter. “There are many more police officers who need to be held accountable,” the family said in a statement. “We hope this case will send a message to all N.Y.P.D. officers and police departments around the country and around the world that they can’t kill and get away with it anymore.”\n\n_____\n\n8. The hatchet Kanye West and Taylor Swift buried a few years ago got disinterred. A day after Mr. West’s fashion show/album release sold out Madison Square Garden, he added a song that included a sexual reference to Taylor Swift and claimed responsibility for her fame. Ms. Swift’s brother threw his Kanye-designed Yeezy sneakers in the trash and posted a video of the act on Instagram.\n\n_____\n\n9. The Rio Olympic Games are still six months away, but this Texas gymnast looks like a real possibility to win gold. Our sports columnist calls Simone Biles, 18 and not quite five feet tall, unfathomably powerful and “the best American gymnast since, well, probably ever.”\n\n_____\n\n10. The U.N. groped for details about how to create a “humanitarian task force” for Syria called for by a new cease-fire deal between the U.S. and Russia. But at the border with Turkey, some Syrians doubted the bombing would end. “The deals they make there are so isolated and detached from this reality here,” one said.\n\n_____\n\n11. Success Academy, a leader in New York City’s charter school movement, has long had critics of its methods for achieving a stellar record of performance on standardized tests. Now there’s concern that some teachers become emotionally abusive, after a video emerged showing one mercilessly berating a first grader for a wrong answer. In interviews, other teachers said demeaning of children was a regular occurrence.\n\n_____\n\n12. Lastly, over the long Presidents’ Day weekend, the public is invited to help with the Great Backyard Bird Count. Last year, 140,000 people in more than 100 countries classified nearly half of the world’s bird types during the four-day event.

With just a few days before polling booths open up on Tuesday, voters are still shopping around to make their final decision.\nAfter delivering his stump speech, the first man to ask a question lit into Trump for mocking a reporter with a disability late last year -- something Trump denies doing.\nThe voter identified himself as a longtime boxing fan and drew an analogy comparing the rivalry between Trump and Bush to a famous boxing match in 1980 between John Tate and Mike Weaver, in which Weaver was losing for 14 rounds until he came back in the 15th round to knock out Tate. \n\"Governor, you're Mike Weaver,\" the man said. \"Throw that punch tonight.\"\nAfter the crowd erupted in agreement, Bush highlighted his own record of helping people with disabilities, and as he's been doing for weeks, lambasted Trump for what he calls his habit of \"disparaging\" people, suggesting this time that his rival candidate needs a visit to the couch.  \n\"It's just ridiculous. It's a sign of deep insecurity. I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but the guy needs therapy,\" Bush said to applause and laughter.\nBush also had some criticism for his other rivals ahead of Saturday night's debate on ABC News. The former Florida governor mocked Sen. Ted Cruz's proposal to \"carpet bomb\" ISIS, saying that's an old school technique and the military has precise weaponry that eliminates the need to carpet bomb.\nHe then turned to Trump's proposal. \"Or say that you are going to bomb the S-H-blank-blank out of ISIS? Really? Is that a serious thought?\"\nIn a not-so-subtle knock against Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio -- both first-term senators -- Bush made his pitch that the country needs an experienced leader. \"We're living in dangerous times. We're not running for the back bench of the United States Senate, we're running for the presidency of the United States,\" he said. \"And you need to have someone who knows what he's doing.\"\nThe more candid Bush also offered a blunt rebuttal to one voter's question about Bush's last name. The young woman said she was a big fan of the family, but asked how can Bush persuade other millennials who are opposed to another Bush in the White House.\nThe candidate referenced his campaign's college network that spans hundreds of campus, but then grew more forthright in his rhetoric about his last name.\n\"The Bush thing, people are just going to have to get over it, alright?\" he said to big applause.\nBush, as he's been doing lately, said he's been characterized as an \"establishment\" candidate because his father and brother were both presidents.\n\"I got no problems with this,\" he said. \"And people that do, they either need to get therapy themselves or realize that we can change the course of this country working together to solve problems.\"\nTo show his embrace of his last name, Bush brought out his mother, Barbara Bush, on the campaign trail this week, and his brother is set to campaign with him in South Carolina before the state's primary later this month.  \nBut Bush's answer wasn't the first time his brother or father's name came up at the event. Earlier, Bush was being introduced by Tom Ridge, and the former Homeland Security Secretary slipped up, saying \"George Bush\" instead of \"Jeb Bush.\"\n\"By the way, I worked for his brother and I love his dad, so excuse me for the mess-up because I think this is a legacy of principled leadership and that's exactly what Jeb Bush would bring to the White House,\" Ridge said.\n\nDespite all the tough talk about his rivals, Bush also showed a softer side on Saturday. When he was asked about drug addiction -- a huge problem in New Hampshire -- Bush signaled he was about to share his daughter's story about her former struggle with the issue. But he paused.\n\"OK, I've not done this next to Columba,\" he said, before he walked over to his wife, who was sitting in the front row, to briefly grab her hand.\nThen he paused again, looked at his feet, and started choking up as he began to talk about how Noelle \"spiraled out of control\" more than a decade ago. It's a story he shares often, and he's even done it with his daughter in attendance. But Saturday marked the first time that he grew emotional in front of an audience when talking about it.\nIt's also the second time in the past few days that Bush choked up at a town hall. He struggled Thursday night as well when his mother was at an event in Derry and Bush mentioned his \"idyllic\" father, whose health makes it difficult for him to make public appearances.\nAside from his emotional moment on Saturday, Bush also had some fun with the audience. He praised the voters for asking \"real\" questions, winning laughs and applause when he said \"the questions on the debate stage will be probably really stupid to be honest with you.\"\nHe also defended his Super Bowl pick of the Denver Broncos because he's a fan of Peyton Manning. After some in the New England crowd moaned and groaned -- this is Patriots country -- Bush protested.\n\"Hey, just a second here\" he said, playfully putting his foot down. \"I'm for Peyton Manning because he's for me.\"\nAs the audience went wild, Bush had one more thing to add: \"He's also managed to be the, uh, the adult in the room -- kinda like me.\"","gunning_fog_4":"10.0","flesch_4":"8.7","readability_4":"68.1","index_5":"10","title_5":"First Draft: Bernie Sanders Promises to Keep Pressing the Campaign","url_5":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-promises-to-keep-pressing-the-campaign/","candidate_5":"Bernie Sanders","org_5":"The New York Times","top_topic_5":"Campaign Finance","body_5":"BOSTON — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed on Monday night that no matter the outcome of the Super Tuesday races, his campaign would continue to rally voters against a political establishment that is largely backing his rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Sanders, standing next to a chartered plane here, said he would “likely” win Vermont’s vote, and also felt good about his chances for winning the most delegates in Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts. He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.\n\n“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”\n\nMr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. \n\n“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”\n\nStill, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.\n\n“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote. They do that very well.”\n\nMr. Sanders went on to repeat criticisms of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to several industries and to cast himself as a candidate more interested in reforming campaign finance laws and dealing with income inequality. To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay’s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for “The Big Short,” a movie about the failure of the banking industry.\n\n“As Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. \n\nMr. Sanders also said that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he didn’t think “real change” comes from someone taking money from such industries and that instead, such change would come from millions of people demanding “a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent.”","gunning_fog_5":"10.0","flesch_5":"8.7","readability_5":"68.1","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination","gold_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html?_r=0","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The New York Times","gold_body":"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7053571428571428},"q1":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.7232142857142858},"q2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7053571428571428},"q3":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q4":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4285714285714286},"q5":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q6":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7053571428571428},"q7":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.7232142857142858},"q8":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q9":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.4285714285714286},"q10":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.7053571428571428},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"female","confidence":0.7053571428571428},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"3049","confidence":0.7053571428571428},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":0.7053571428571428},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"bernie_sanders","confidence":0.4285714285714286}}}

Giuliani, the former mayor of New York,  is an admirer of Donald J. Trump and has been friends with him for decades. His endorsement could be useful to Mr. Trump, both as an affirmation in national security terms and an appeal to transplanted New Yorkers in Florida and elsewhere. \n\nBut while Mr. Giuliani speaks with Mr. Trump regularly, and has done so for months, he does not consider himself an adviser and is not yet ready to endorse any of the candidates. \n\n“I wouldn’t call it advising him,” Mr. Giuliani said in a telephone interview on Monday after a published report suggested he has recently emerged as a key adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani added, “I’m not sure who I’m going to endorse,” though he said he was open to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, but “not Cruz,” he said, referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump’s chief rival so far.\n\nMr. Giuliani was mayor for eight years and before that the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where Mr. Trump has been a major figure since the late 1980s. \n\n“I talk to him on a pretty regular basis,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I don’t consider myself an adviser. I’ve talked to Donald for 25 years. So I talk to him a lot anyway.” \n\nMr. Giuliani said he frequently spoke with Jeb Bush when he was a candidate, about as frequently as he did to Mr. Trump, and that he spoke more frequently with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with whom he is also friends. \n\nAs for Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani said he would call and offer his thoughts and advice on a range of topics. “Sometimes he takes it, sometimes he doesn’t,” Mr. Giuliani said. He told Mr. Trump that he thought his statement during his campaign kickoff speech that Mexican immigrants were rapists and were bringing crime into the country “was backwards,” although he thought he had “a pretty good point about illegal immigration.” \n\nHe said he also still considered former President George W. Bush “one of my heroes,” and disagreed with Mr. Trump’s assertions that the Bush administration has mishandled the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \n\nBut Mr. Giuliani, who was heralded for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and ran for president himself in 2008, said Mr. Trump had made a valuable case about China’s currency manipulation. He  said he also valued what Mr. Trump had said about the terrorism threats of the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Rubio are “more flexible people” than Mr.  Cruz, Mr. Giuliani said. “They’re not rigid ideologues.” \n\nHe added of Mr. Trump, “You don’t succeed in business by being a rigid ideologue.”","gunning_fog_1":"6.4","flesch_1":"4.0","readability_1":"85.69","index_2":"40","title_2":"Ted Cruz Starts to Crack G.O.P.

Scott Sewell seemed an unlikely figure to be attending a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz. An oil industry executive, Mr. Sewell served in President George Bush’s administration, lent a hand to George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential recount, and was twice a chairman for Mitt Romney’s Louisiana campaigns.\n\nBut if such a creature of the Republican establishment appeared an odd fit to support a candidate whose political identity was shaped challenging his party’s leadership, the candlelit, art-filled setting for Mr. Cruz’s reception was even more surprising: the elegant home of the longtime Bush loyalist Mary Matalin and her husband, James Carville, the Democratic strategist.\n\nThe vast majority of Republican elites remain bitterly opposed to the prospect of Mr. Cruz’s becoming the party’s presidential nominee, some even preferring to take their chances with Donald J. Trump. Yet, to the strains of a jazz trio a block from St. Charles Avenue here, over Texas barbecue at his Houston campaign office and in one of Washington’s see-and-be-seen steakhouses, Mr. Cruz, Washington’s chief anti-establishment agitator, has quietly begun wooing some of the party’s most entrenched donors and officials.\n\n“We’re working hard to consolidate a lot of support,” Mr. Cruz told a reporter as he mingled with guests arriving at Ms. Matalin’s home.\n\nSome in the old guard have started signaling to their reluctant right-of-center brethren that it is time to face the possibility that the hard-line Mr. Cruz could be their standard-bearer.\n\n“If Cruz makes it, which is very doable, every one of the establishment crowd who is now eviscerating him will line up, salute smartly and get on board,” Ms. Matalin said, offering a mix of prodding and prophecy. “No one will want to be responsible for a G.O.P. defeat.”\n\nThat even traces of détente have appeared between Mr. Cruz and the party’s traditional power brokers this early illustrates how thoroughly unpredictable the Republican race has been — and that, for major political donors, it can be safer to hedge one’s bets in such a volatile environment.\n\nBut others in the party hierarchy, including the officially neutral Ms. Matalin, either share some of the frustrations that have propelled Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump or at least recognize what the two have tapped into.\n\nThey also take him at his word. “I believe in Senator Cruz because he believes what he’s saying,” Mr. Sewell said outside the Matalin-Carville home, echoing sentiments often heard among the rank-and-file at Mr. Cruz’s Iowa gatherings.\n\nWhat is more striking, and will cause deep consternation among Republican strategists, is that other donors are beginning to embrace Mr. Cruz’s argument that he can win a general election by motivating core conservatives to come to the polls rather than by appealing to swing voters.\n\nAndrew Puzder, chief executive of the conglomerate that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., supported both of Mr. Romney’s campaigns and has contributed to a number of “super PACs” and candidates this year, including Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But after spending a couple of hours eating brisket with Mr. Cruz on Sunday at his campaign headquarters, Mr. Puzder said he was “very seriously considering” getting behind him, in part because of his appeal to the conservative base.\n\n“I’ve become a one-issue voter,” Mr. Puzder said. “My one issue is whether somebody is going to win. My big question is: What is your path to a general election victory?”\n\nUnhappily recalling that Mr. Romney won among self-described independents but still was soundly defeated by President Obama, Mr. Puzder said, “Part of the reason was that the base didn’t turn out to vote, and Senator Cruz understands that needs to happen.”\n\nThe theory of the missing conservative voter, central to Mr. Cruz’s pitch, has been widely and robustly challenged, including by figures on the right. But it is taking flight among some in the party’s donor class.\n\n“The reason Republicans lost in 2012 and 2008 is not because we lost swing voters,” Carla Sands, a California investor, wrote in an invitation to a $1,000-a-plate Los Angeles luncheon this week featuring Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi. “The reason Republicans lost is because they failed to motivate and turn out their base — mainly evangelical voters in states like Florida, Colorado and Pennsylvania who didn’t feel that the Republican nominee spoke to their issues.”\n\nMs. Sands, a philanthropist who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to establishment-aligned Republicans, predicted that “this election will also be a ‘base’ election, and we need a candidate who inspires and excites the base of our party to come out and vote.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s wife, who met him on the 2000 Bush campaign and worked in the administration, has emerged as something of a liaison to right-of-center donors. She headlined events in Atlanta; Austin, Dallas, Houston and Midland, Tex.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Seattle in November and December, helping Mr. Cruz raise nearly $20 million in the final quarter of the year — a haul expected to exceed those of any of the more establishment-friendly candidates.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz has other links to the party elites he has long railed against: Mr. Puzder was connected to him by Anthony R. Dolan, Ronald Reagan’s chief speechwriter, who is now part of Mr. Cruz’s team of advisers. Chad Sweet, Mr. Cruz’s campaign chairman, worked at Goldman Sachs and was chief of staff to Michael Chertoff, a Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush.\n\nMr. Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, has also cultivated relationships with the relatively small universe of Republican strategists. In December, he telephoned the lobbyist Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns, about arranging a get-acquainted meeting with him for Mr. Cruz when Congress returns this month (the meeting has not come about).\n\nMr. Cruz will, though, appear at a pair of fund-raisers in the Washington area next week that may lure some party regulars: a $1,000 per-person “happy hour” at the Capital Grille, followed by an event at the McLean, Va., home of Michael Adams, a former Bechtel Group executive.\n\nNot all of Mr. Cruz’s wooing has led to a love connection. Former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, who describes himself as “a RINO” — a Republican in name only — rode from the airport to a fund-raiser with Mr. Cruz when the Texas senator visited California last month.\n\n“He’s doing extremely well, which surprises me because I don’t think he’s as warm a personality as others,” Mr. Riordan said. “But he’s a very strong person.”\n\nThe response was more favorable in New Orleans, where Mr. Cruz drew younger Republicans and local figures like William Goldring, a distillery executive, the restaurateur Dickie Brennan and Rob Maness, who ran for the Senate here in 2014.\n\nMr. Cruz, who has wandered into trouble at some private events by saying things he does not say in public, mainly stuck to policy, according to two attendees. But he also spoke more personally than he often did on the stump, describing his connections to Louisiana and praising the city’s music and cuisine.\n\nHe even poked a bit of good-natured fun at his wife’s dietary preferences, describing “what it’s like to be from Texas and have Christmas dinner with vegetarians.”","gunning_fog_2":"8.0","flesch_2":"8.0","readability_2":"64.71","index_3":"24","title_3":"Sanders goes negative with Goldman Sachs, Iraq jabs","url_3":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/sanders-negative-goldman-sachs-iraq/index.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"CNN","top_topic_3":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_3":"Carroll, Iowa (CNN) Bernie Sanders has a new bus for the last two weeks before the all-important caucuses in Iowa and also a new strategy: attacking Hillary Clinton where she's most vulnerable. \nSanders has been inching there for months now, but he finally dropped the nice-guy routine this week -- and with an only slightly coy hit on knitting together Clinton's fabled speaking fees and her Wall Street connections.\n\"By the way, without naming any names, Goldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates,\" Sanders said, as the crowd chuckled. \"Very generous. Now I know that some of my opponents are very good speakers, very fine orators, very smart people, but you gotta be really really, really good to get $225,000 a speech. That's all I'll say.\"\nHe obviously did not need to name names; a member of the audience yelled, \"It was $600,000!\" \nSanders laughed and said, \"That's for three speeches.\" \nHis audience didn't seem to mind that the senator, who declared months ago that he wouldn't go negative, was now doing exactly that.\nAt the top of his speeches Tuesday in Fort Dodge and Carroll, Sanders spoke about the movement and revolution (as he likes to call it) that his campaign is bringing across America, boasting that 450,000 people have come to see his campaign speeches in the past eight months.\n\"You may hear me say a word or two about my friend Donald Trump but not my Democratic colleagues, who are serious people,\" Sanders said. He also pointed to the name-calling and candidates \"ripping into each other,\" which seems like a not-so-subtle hit at Trump.\nBut then only a few minutes later, Sanders criticized Clinton's campaign fundraising tactics and the spending of her super PAC, pointing out that he is proud to not have the support of an official super PAC. At the bottom of his official campaign emails, a note says, \"Paid for by Bernie, not the billionaires.\"\n\nSanders sharp tone comes as he has arisen as a serious threat to swipe the Democratic nomination from Clinton. Facing a possible repeat of 2008, Clinton has unloaded on Sanders as well -- painting him as an impractical radical and someone who could ultimately lose the White House for Democrats.\nClinton's latest hit was a letter from top diplomats questioning Sanders' ability to handle serious international situations, including relations with Iran. \n\"The stakes are high. And we are concerned that Sen. Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security,\" the diplomats wrote in their letter. \"His lack of a strategy for defeating ISIS -- one of the greatest challenges we face today -- is troubling. And the limited things he has said on ISIS are also troubling.\"\nAt a stop in Underwood, as Sanders took questions from the crowd, one woman pointed out to him that he's taking some heat for \"not having foreign policy experience.\" Sanders' defense rests in the logic that experience does not equal good judgment. \nHis example? Dick Cheney, who Sanders remarked, \"had a hell of a lot of experience, God help us all.\"\nBut much like the 2008 election where a fresh-faced senator touted his opposition against the war in Iraq, Sanders reminded the audience of Clinton's voting record on the matter, saying that she dutifully listened to Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld. \"She voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nMo Elleithee, former communications director for the Democratic Party and a veteran of numerous White House bids, including Clinton's 2008 run, said he doesn't think attacking Clinton will hurt Sanders -- unless he goes too far.\n\"Unless he crosses a line, I doubt it hurts him. On some level, he wants to be careful, he promises to be something to be different, at a certain point he can take it too far and look like everyone else,\" Elleithee said. \nHe added the last two weeks before the Iowa caucuses are when candidates want to excite supporters, but it also \"has the potential for backfiring if he looks too typical.\"","gunning_fog_3":"11.2","flesch_3":"11.1","readability_3":"56.59","index_4":"11","title_4":"Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator","url_4":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.\nAt the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.\nThey were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long.

Trump had a good enough campaign operation to win in Nevada. One thing Mr. Trump had going for him, I pointed out, was that he was very good at getting the news media to give him free airtime. \n\n“Every time he opens his mouth, he’s on national TV, telling jokes and giving his message — so he’s saved himself tens of millions of dollars doing that,” I said. Almost as soon as I finished making my point, the network demonstrated it by cutting to a Trump rally in Atlanta.\n\nSuch is the unusual world of Mr. Trump’s political finances. As a reporter who covers campaign finance, I spend my days trying to figure out where the money is. But Mr. Trump presents a different sort of challenge: Not so much where the money is, but where the money isn’t. \n\nThe only person who has spent less money running for president than Mr. Trump — and who hasn’t yet stopped running for president — is John Kasich. This is partly because Mr. Trump was famous in his own right before he plunged into the 2016 race. It is also partly because many of Mr. Trump’s campaign expenses, such as rides on his own private jets and helicopters, or borrowing aides from his real estate empire, get paid out to his own companies. \n\nBut even beyond that, it is because Mr. Trump doesn’t spend much on television ads, usually the single most expensive budget item for a modern presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump garners what political hacks call “earned media.” He holds big rallies, says provocative things that his audience adores — “I’d like to punch him in the face,” Mr. Trump said of a heckler at his event in Nevada on Monday — and reaps of a wave of news coverage in newspapers and on television. This dynamic has earned the scorn of Trump-haters on the right and left, who have taken to blaming the news media for enabling Mr. Trump’s rise. \n\nMr. Trump is undeniably a showman. Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a poll-tested message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the earned-media department, then proceeded to “trump” Mr. Trump, with a 20-minute riff on “squirmishes” and “proud clingers.”)\n\nJust how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals — Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz — are spending a combined $1.5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. \n\nMr. Trump’s bill?\n\nZero.","gunning_fog_5":"7.6","flesch_5":"5.2","readability_5":"82.65","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.645833333333333,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T02:24:06+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952926332,"created_at":"2016-04-08T02:21:58+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T02:11:39+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"coinworker","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"WA","city":"Renton","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915119,"worker_id":36263705,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.95875,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"0","q2":"0","q3":"1","q4":"-2","q5":"0","q6":"1","q7":"-1","q8":"-1","q9":"1","q10":"-1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"no_affiliation","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"13","index_1":"90","title_1":"First Draft: Rudy Giuliani, Although Friends With Donald Trump, Is Not Ready to Endorse Yet","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/rudy-giuliani-although-friends-with-donald-trump-is-not-ready-to-endorse-yet/","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York,  is an admirer of Donald J. Trump and has been friends with him for decades. His endorsement could be useful to Mr. Trump, both as an affirmation in national security terms and an appeal to transplanted New Yorkers in Florida and elsewhere. \n\nBut while Mr. Giuliani speaks with Mr. Trump regularly, and has done so for months, he does not consider himself an adviser and is not yet ready to endorse any of the candidates. \n\n“I wouldn’t call it advising him,” Mr. Giuliani said in a telephone interview on Monday after a published report suggested he has recently emerged as a key adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani added, “I’m not sure who I’m going to endorse,” though he said he was open to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, but “not Cruz,” he said, referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump’s chief rival so far.\n\nMr. Giuliani was mayor for eight years and before that the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where Mr. Trump has been a major figure since the late 1980s. \n\n“I talk to him on a pretty regular basis,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I don’t consider myself an adviser. I’ve talked to Donald for 25 years. So I talk to him a lot anyway.” \n\nMr. Giuliani said he frequently spoke with Jeb Bush when he was a candidate, about as frequently as he did to Mr. Trump, and that he spoke more frequently with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with whom he is also friends. \n\nAs for Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani said he would call and offer his thoughts and advice on a range of topics. “Sometimes he takes it, sometimes he doesn’t,” Mr. Giuliani said. He told Mr. Trump that he thought his statement during his campaign kickoff speech that Mexican immigrants were rapists and were bringing crime into the country “was backwards,” although he thought he had “a pretty good point about illegal immigration.” \n\nHe said he also still considered former President George W. Bush “one of my heroes,” and disagreed with Mr. Trump’s assertions that the Bush administration has mishandled the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \n\nBut Mr. Giuliani, who was heralded for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and ran for president himself in 2008, said Mr. Trump had made a valuable case about China’s currency manipulation. He  said he also valued what Mr. Trump had said about the terrorism threats of the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Rubio are “more flexible people” than Mr.  Cruz, Mr. Giuliani said. “They’re not rigid ideologues.” \n\nHe added of Mr. Trump, “You don’t succeed in business by being a rigid ideologue.”","gunning_fog_1":"6.4","flesch_1":"4.0","readability_1":"85.69","index_2":"40","title_2":"Ted Cruz Starts to Crack G.O.P.

Scott Sewell seemed an unlikely figure to be attending a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz. An oil industry executive, Mr. Sewell served in President George Bush’s administration, lent a hand to George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential recount, and was twice a chairman for Mitt Romney’s Louisiana campaigns.\n\nBut if such a creature of the Republican establishment appeared an odd fit to support a candidate whose political identity was shaped challenging his party’s leadership, the candlelit, art-filled setting for Mr. Cruz’s reception was even more surprising: the elegant home of the longtime Bush loyalist Mary Matalin and her husband, James Carville, the Democratic strategist.\n\nThe vast majority of Republican elites remain bitterly opposed to the prospect of Mr. Cruz’s becoming the party’s presidential nominee, some even preferring to take their chances with Donald J. Trump. Yet, to the strains of a jazz trio a block from St. Charles Avenue here, over Texas barbecue at his Houston campaign office and in one of Washington’s see-and-be-seen steakhouses, Mr. Cruz, Washington’s chief anti-establishment agitator, has quietly begun wooing some of the party’s most entrenched donors and officials.\n\n“We’re working hard to consolidate a lot of support,” Mr. Cruz told a reporter as he mingled with guests arriving at Ms. Matalin’s home.\n\nSome in the old guard have started signaling to their reluctant right-of-center brethren that it is time to face the possibility that the hard-line Mr. Cruz could be their standard-bearer.\n\n“If Cruz makes it, which is very doable, every one of the establishment crowd who is now eviscerating him will line up, salute smartly and get on board,” Ms. Matalin said, offering a mix of prodding and prophecy. “No one will want to be responsible for a G.O.P. defeat.”\n\nThat even traces of détente have appeared between Mr. Cruz and the party’s traditional power brokers this early illustrates how thoroughly unpredictable the Republican race has been — and that, for major political donors, it can be safer to hedge one’s bets in such a volatile environment.\n\nBut others in the party hierarchy, including the officially neutral Ms. Matalin, either share some of the frustrations that have propelled Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump or at least recognize what the two have tapped into.\n\nThey also take him at his word. “I believe in Senator Cruz because he believes what he’s saying,” Mr. Sewell said outside the Matalin-Carville home, echoing sentiments often heard among the rank-and-file at Mr. Cruz’s Iowa gatherings.\n\nWhat is more striking, and will cause deep consternation among Republican strategists, is that other donors are beginning to embrace Mr. Cruz’s argument that he can win a general election by motivating core conservatives to come to the polls rather than by appealing to swing voters.\n\nAndrew Puzder, chief executive of the conglomerate that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., supported both of Mr. Romney’s campaigns and has contributed to a number of “super PACs” and candidates this year, including Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But after spending a couple of hours eating brisket with Mr. Cruz on Sunday at his campaign headquarters, Mr. Puzder said he was “very seriously considering” getting behind him, in part because of his appeal to the conservative base.\n\n“I’ve become a one-issue voter,” Mr. Puzder said. “My one issue is whether somebody is going to win. My big question is: What is your path to a general election victory?”\n\nUnhappily recalling that Mr. Romney won among self-described independents but still was soundly defeated by President Obama, Mr. Puzder said, “Part of the reason was that the base didn’t turn out to vote, and Senator Cruz understands that needs to happen.”\n\nThe theory of the missing conservative voter, central to Mr. Cruz’s pitch, has been widely and robustly challenged, including by figures on the right. But it is taking flight among some in the party’s donor class.\n\n“The reason Republicans lost in 2012 and 2008 is not because we lost swing voters,” Carla Sands, a California investor, wrote in an invitation to a $1,000-a-plate Los Angeles luncheon this week featuring Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi. “The reason Republicans lost is because they failed to motivate and turn out their base — mainly evangelical voters in states like Florida, Colorado and Pennsylvania who didn’t feel that the Republican nominee spoke to their issues.”\n\nMs. Sands, a philanthropist who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to establishment-aligned Republicans, predicted that “this election will also be a ‘base’ election, and we need a candidate who inspires and excites the base of our party to come out and vote.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s wife, who met him on the 2000 Bush campaign and worked in the administration, has emerged as something of a liaison to right-of-center donors. She headlined events in Atlanta; Austin, Dallas, Houston and Midland, Tex.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Seattle in November and December, helping Mr. Cruz raise nearly $20 million in the final quarter of the year — a haul expected to exceed those of any of the more establishment-friendly candidates.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz has other links to the party elites he has long railed against: Mr. Puzder was connected to him by Anthony R. Dolan, Ronald Reagan’s chief speechwriter, who is now part of Mr. Cruz’s team of advisers. Chad Sweet, Mr. Cruz’s campaign chairman, worked at Goldman Sachs and was chief of staff to Michael Chertoff, a Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush.\n\nMr. Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, has also cultivated relationships with the relatively small universe of Republican strategists. In December, he telephoned the lobbyist Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns, about arranging a get-acquainted meeting with him for Mr. Cruz when Congress returns this month (the meeting has not come about).\n\nMr. Cruz will, though, appear at a pair of fund-raisers in the Washington area next week that may lure some party regulars: a $1,000 per-person “happy hour” at the Capital Grille, followed by an event at the McLean, Va., home of Michael Adams, a former Bechtel Group executive.\n\nNot all of Mr. Cruz’s wooing has led to a love connection. Former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, who describes himself as “a RINO” — a Republican in name only — rode from the airport to a fund-raiser with Mr. Cruz when the Texas senator visited California last month.\n\n“He’s doing extremely well, which surprises me because I don’t think he’s as warm a personality as others,” Mr. Riordan said. “But he’s a very strong person.”\n\nThe response was more favorable in New Orleans, where Mr. Cruz drew younger Republicans and local figures like William Goldring, a distillery executive, the restaurateur Dickie Brennan and Rob Maness, who ran for the Senate here in 2014.\n\nMr. Cruz, who has wandered into trouble at some private events by saying things he does not say in public, mainly stuck to policy, according to two attendees. But he also spoke more personally than he often did on the stump, describing his connections to Louisiana and praising the city’s music and cuisine.\n\nHe even poked a bit of good-natured fun at his wife’s dietary preferences, describing “what it’s like to be from Texas and have Christmas dinner with vegetarians.”","gunning_fog_2":"8.0","flesch_2":"8.0","readability_2":"64.71","index_3":"24","title_3":"Sanders goes negative with Goldman Sachs, Iraq jabs","url_3":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/sanders-negative-goldman-sachs-iraq/index.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"CNN","top_topic_3":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_3":"Carroll, Iowa (CNN) Bernie Sanders has a new bus for the last two weeks before the all-important caucuses in Iowa and also a new strategy: attacking Hillary Clinton where she's most vulnerable. \nSanders has been inching there for months now, but he finally dropped the nice-guy routine this week -- and with an only slightly coy hit on knitting together Clinton's fabled speaking fees and her Wall Street connections.\n\"By the way, without naming any names, Goldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates,\" Sanders said, as the crowd chuckled. \"Very generous. Now I know that some of my opponents are very good speakers, very fine orators, very smart people, but you gotta be really really, really good to get $225,000 a speech. That's all I'll say.\"\nHe obviously did not need to name names; a member of the audience yelled, \"It was $600,000!\" \nSanders laughed and said, \"That's for three speeches.\" \nHis audience didn't seem to mind that the senator, who declared months ago that he wouldn't go negative, was now doing exactly that.\nAt the top of his speeches Tuesday in Fort Dodge and Carroll, Sanders spoke about the movement and revolution (as he likes to call it) that his campaign is bringing across America, boasting that 450,000 people have come to see his campaign speeches in the past eight months.\n\"You may hear me say a word or two about my friend Donald Trump but not my Democratic colleagues, who are serious people,\" Sanders said. He also pointed to the name-calling and candidates \"ripping into each other,\" which seems like a not-so-subtle hit at Trump.\nBut then only a few minutes later, Sanders criticized Clinton's campaign fundraising tactics and the spending of her super PAC, pointing out that he is proud to not have the support of an official super PAC. At the bottom of his official campaign emails, a note says, \"Paid for by Bernie, not the billionaires.\"\n\nSanders sharp tone comes as he has arisen as a serious threat to swipe the Democratic nomination from Clinton. Facing a possible repeat of 2008, Clinton has unloaded on Sanders as well -- painting him as an impractical radical and someone who could ultimately lose the White House for Democrats.\nClinton's latest hit was a letter from top diplomats questioning Sanders' ability to handle serious international situations, including relations with Iran. \n\"The stakes are high. And we are concerned that Sen. Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security,\" the diplomats wrote in their letter. \"His lack of a strategy for defeating ISIS -- one of the greatest challenges we face today -- is troubling. And the limited things he has said on ISIS are also troubling.\"\nAt a stop in Underwood, as Sanders took questions from the crowd, one woman pointed out to him that he's taking some heat for \"not having foreign policy experience.\" Sanders' defense rests in the logic that experience does not equal good judgment. \nHis example? Dick Cheney, who Sanders remarked, \"had a hell of a lot of experience, God help us all.\"\nBut much like the 2008 election where a fresh-faced senator touted his opposition against the war in Iraq, Sanders reminded the audience of Clinton's voting record on the matter, saying that she dutifully listened to Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld. \"She voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nMo Elleithee, former communications director for the Democratic Party and a veteran of numerous White House bids, including Clinton's 2008 run, said he doesn't think attacking Clinton will hurt Sanders -- unless he goes too far.\n\"Unless he crosses a line, I doubt it hurts him. On some level, he wants to be careful, he promises to be something to be different, at a certain point he can take it too far and look like everyone else,\" Elleithee said. \nHe added the last two weeks before the Iowa caucuses are when candidates want to excite supporters, but it also \"has the potential for backfiring if he looks too typical.\"","gunning_fog_3":"11.2","flesch_3":"11.1","readability_3":"56.59","index_4":"11","title_4":"Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator","url_4":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.\nAt the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.\nThey were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long.

Trump had a good enough campaign operation to win in Nevada. One thing Mr. Trump had going for him, I pointed out, was that he was very good at getting the news media to give him free airtime. \n\n“Every time he opens his mouth, he’s on national TV, telling jokes and giving his message — so he’s saved himself tens of millions of dollars doing that,” I said. Almost as soon as I finished making my point, the network demonstrated it by cutting to a Trump rally in Atlanta.\n\nSuch is the unusual world of Mr. Trump’s political finances. As a reporter who covers campaign finance, I spend my days trying to figure out where the money is. But Mr. Trump presents a different sort of challenge: Not so much where the money is, but where the money isn’t. \n\nThe only person who has spent less money running for president than Mr. Trump — and who hasn’t yet stopped running for president — is John Kasich. This is partly because Mr. Trump was famous in his own right before he plunged into the 2016 race. It is also partly because many of Mr. Trump’s campaign expenses, such as rides on his own private jets and helicopters, or borrowing aides from his real estate empire, get paid out to his own companies. \n\nBut even beyond that, it is because Mr. Trump doesn’t spend much on television ads, usually the single most expensive budget item for a modern presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump garners what political hacks call “earned media.” He holds big rallies, says provocative things that his audience adores — “I’d like to punch him in the face,” Mr. Trump said of a heckler at his event in Nevada on Monday — and reaps of a wave of news coverage in newspapers and on television. This dynamic has earned the scorn of Trump-haters on the right and left, who have taken to blaming the news media for enabling Mr. Trump’s rise. \n\nMr. Trump is undeniably a showman. Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a poll-tested message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the earned-media department, then proceeded to “trump” Mr. Trump, with a 20-minute riff on “squirmishes” and “proud clingers.”)\n\nJust how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals — Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz — are spending a combined $1.5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. \n\nMr. Trump’s bill?\n\nZero.","gunning_fog_5":"7.6","flesch_5":"5.2","readability_5":"82.65","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}},{"id":1952926376,"created_at":"2016-04-08T02:22:02+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T02:15:55+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"gifthunterclub","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NY","city":"Potsdam","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915119,"worker_id":31063905,"trust":0.3125,"worker_trust":0.85125,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"2","q1":"1","q2":"2","q3":"1","q4":"2","q5":"-1","q6":"1","q7":"0","q8":"-1","q9":"0","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"13","index_1":"90","title_1":"First Draft: Rudy Giuliani, Although Friends With Donald Trump, Is Not Ready to Endorse Yet","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/rudy-giuliani-although-friends-with-donald-trump-is-not-ready-to-endorse-yet/","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York,  is an admirer of Donald J. Trump and has been friends with him for decades. His endorsement could be useful to Mr. Trump, both as an affirmation in national security terms and an appeal to transplanted New Yorkers in Florida and elsewhere. \n\nBut while Mr. Giuliani speaks with Mr. Trump regularly, and has done so for months, he does not consider himself an adviser and is not yet ready to endorse any of the candidates. \n\n“I wouldn’t call it advising him,” Mr. Giuliani said in a telephone interview on Monday after a published report suggested he has recently emerged as a key adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani added, “I’m not sure who I’m going to endorse,” though he said he was open to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, but “not Cruz,” he said, referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump’s chief rival so far.\n\nMr. Giuliani was mayor for eight years and before that the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where Mr. Trump has been a major figure since the late 1980s. \n\n“I talk to him on a pretty regular basis,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I don’t consider myself an adviser. I’ve talked to Donald for 25 years. So I talk to him a lot anyway.” \n\nMr. Giuliani said he frequently spoke with Jeb Bush when he was a candidate, about as frequently as he did to Mr. Trump, and that he spoke more frequently with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with whom he is also friends. \n\nAs for Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani said he would call and offer his thoughts and advice on a range of topics. “Sometimes he takes it, sometimes he doesn’t,” Mr. Giuliani said. He told Mr. Trump that he thought his statement during his campaign kickoff speech that Mexican immigrants were rapists and were bringing crime into the country “was backwards,” although he thought he had “a pretty good point about illegal immigration.” \n\nHe said he also still considered former President George W. Bush “one of my heroes,” and disagreed with Mr. Trump’s assertions that the Bush administration has mishandled the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \n\nBut Mr. Giuliani, who was heralded for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and ran for president himself in 2008, said Mr. Trump had made a valuable case about China’s currency manipulation. He  said he also valued what Mr. Trump had said about the terrorism threats of the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Rubio are “more flexible people” than Mr.  Cruz, Mr. Giuliani said. “They’re not rigid ideologues.” \n\nHe added of Mr. Trump, “You don’t succeed in business by being a rigid ideologue.”","gunning_fog_1":"6.4","flesch_1":"4.0","readability_1":"85.69","index_2":"40","title_2":"Ted Cruz Starts to Crack G.O.P.

Scott Sewell seemed an unlikely figure to be attending a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz. An oil industry executive, Mr. Sewell served in President George Bush’s administration, lent a hand to George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential recount, and was twice a chairman for Mitt Romney’s Louisiana campaigns.\n\nBut if such a creature of the Republican establishment appeared an odd fit to support a candidate whose political identity was shaped challenging his party’s leadership, the candlelit, art-filled setting for Mr. Cruz’s reception was even more surprising: the elegant home of the longtime Bush loyalist Mary Matalin and her husband, James Carville, the Democratic strategist.\n\nThe vast majority of Republican elites remain bitterly opposed to the prospect of Mr. Cruz’s becoming the party’s presidential nominee, some even preferring to take their chances with Donald J. Trump. Yet, to the strains of a jazz trio a block from St. Charles Avenue here, over Texas barbecue at his Houston campaign office and in one of Washington’s see-and-be-seen steakhouses, Mr. Cruz, Washington’s chief anti-establishment agitator, has quietly begun wooing some of the party’s most entrenched donors and officials.\n\n“We’re working hard to consolidate a lot of support,” Mr. Cruz told a reporter as he mingled with guests arriving at Ms. Matalin’s home.\n\nSome in the old guard have started signaling to their reluctant right-of-center brethren that it is time to face the possibility that the hard-line Mr. Cruz could be their standard-bearer.\n\n“If Cruz makes it, which is very doable, every one of the establishment crowd who is now eviscerating him will line up, salute smartly and get on board,” Ms. Matalin said, offering a mix of prodding and prophecy. “No one will want to be responsible for a G.O.P. defeat.”\n\nThat even traces of détente have appeared between Mr. Cruz and the party’s traditional power brokers this early illustrates how thoroughly unpredictable the Republican race has been — and that, for major political donors, it can be safer to hedge one’s bets in such a volatile environment.\n\nBut others in the party hierarchy, including the officially neutral Ms. Matalin, either share some of the frustrations that have propelled Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump or at least recognize what the two have tapped into.\n\nThey also take him at his word. “I believe in Senator Cruz because he believes what he’s saying,” Mr. Sewell said outside the Matalin-Carville home, echoing sentiments often heard among the rank-and-file at Mr. Cruz’s Iowa gatherings.\n\nWhat is more striking, and will cause deep consternation among Republican strategists, is that other donors are beginning to embrace Mr. Cruz’s argument that he can win a general election by motivating core conservatives to come to the polls rather than by appealing to swing voters.\n\nAndrew Puzder, chief executive of the conglomerate that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., supported both of Mr. Romney’s campaigns and has contributed to a number of “super PACs” and candidates this year, including Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But after spending a couple of hours eating brisket with Mr. Cruz on Sunday at his campaign headquarters, Mr. Puzder said he was “very seriously considering” getting behind him, in part because of his appeal to the conservative base.\n\n“I’ve become a one-issue voter,” Mr. Puzder said. “My one issue is whether somebody is going to win. My big question is: What is your path to a general election victory?”\n\nUnhappily recalling that Mr. Romney won among self-described independents but still was soundly defeated by President Obama, Mr. Puzder said, “Part of the reason was that the base didn’t turn out to vote, and Senator Cruz understands that needs to happen.”\n\nThe theory of the missing conservative voter, central to Mr. Cruz’s pitch, has been widely and robustly challenged, including by figures on the right. But it is taking flight among some in the party’s donor class.\n\n“The reason Republicans lost in 2012 and 2008 is not because we lost swing voters,” Carla Sands, a California investor, wrote in an invitation to a $1,000-a-plate Los Angeles luncheon this week featuring Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi. “The reason Republicans lost is because they failed to motivate and turn out their base — mainly evangelical voters in states like Florida, Colorado and Pennsylvania who didn’t feel that the Republican nominee spoke to their issues.”\n\nMs. Sands, a philanthropist who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to establishment-aligned Republicans, predicted that “this election will also be a ‘base’ election, and we need a candidate who inspires and excites the base of our party to come out and vote.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s wife, who met him on the 2000 Bush campaign and worked in the administration, has emerged as something of a liaison to right-of-center donors. She headlined events in Atlanta; Austin, Dallas, Houston and Midland, Tex.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Seattle in November and December, helping Mr. Cruz raise nearly $20 million in the final quarter of the year — a haul expected to exceed those of any of the more establishment-friendly candidates.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz has other links to the party elites he has long railed against: Mr. Puzder was connected to him by Anthony R. Dolan, Ronald Reagan’s chief speechwriter, who is now part of Mr. Cruz’s team of advisers. Chad Sweet, Mr. Cruz’s campaign chairman, worked at Goldman Sachs and was chief of staff to Michael Chertoff, a Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush.\n\nMr. Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, has also cultivated relationships with the relatively small universe of Republican strategists. In December, he telephoned the lobbyist Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns, about arranging a get-acquainted meeting with him for Mr. Cruz when Congress returns this month (the meeting has not come about).\n\nMr. Cruz will, though, appear at a pair of fund-raisers in the Washington area next week that may lure some party regulars: a $1,000 per-person “happy hour” at the Capital Grille, followed by an event at the McLean, Va., home of Michael Adams, a former Bechtel Group executive.\n\nNot all of Mr. Cruz’s wooing has led to a love connection. Former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, who describes himself as “a RINO” — a Republican in name only — rode from the airport to a fund-raiser with Mr. Cruz when the Texas senator visited California last month.\n\n“He’s doing extremely well, which surprises me because I don’t think he’s as warm a personality as others,” Mr. Riordan said. “But he’s a very strong person.”\n\nThe response was more favorable in New Orleans, where Mr. Cruz drew younger Republicans and local figures like William Goldring, a distillery executive, the restaurateur Dickie Brennan and Rob Maness, who ran for the Senate here in 2014.\n\nMr. Cruz, who has wandered into trouble at some private events by saying things he does not say in public, mainly stuck to policy, according to two attendees. But he also spoke more personally than he often did on the stump, describing his connections to Louisiana and praising the city’s music and cuisine.\n\nHe even poked a bit of good-natured fun at his wife’s dietary preferences, describing “what it’s like to be from Texas and have Christmas dinner with vegetarians.”","gunning_fog_2":"8.0","flesch_2":"8.0","readability_2":"64.71","index_3":"24","title_3":"Sanders goes negative with Goldman Sachs, Iraq jabs","url_3":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/sanders-negative-goldman-sachs-iraq/index.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"CNN","top_topic_3":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_3":"Carroll, Iowa (CNN) Bernie Sanders has a new bus for the last two weeks before the all-important caucuses in Iowa and also a new strategy: attacking Hillary Clinton where she's most vulnerable. \nSanders has been inching there for months now, but he finally dropped the nice-guy routine this week -- and with an only slightly coy hit on knitting together Clinton's fabled speaking fees and her Wall Street connections.\n\"By the way, without naming any names, Goldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates,\" Sanders said, as the crowd chuckled. \"Very generous. Now I know that some of my opponents are very good speakers, very fine orators, very smart people, but you gotta be really really, really good to get $225,000 a speech. That's all I'll say.\"\nHe obviously did not need to name names; a member of the audience yelled, \"It was $600,000!\" \nSanders laughed and said, \"That's for three speeches.\" \nHis audience didn't seem to mind that the senator, who declared months ago that he wouldn't go negative, was now doing exactly that.\nAt the top of his speeches Tuesday in Fort Dodge and Carroll, Sanders spoke about the movement and revolution (as he likes to call it) that his campaign is bringing across America, boasting that 450,000 people have come to see his campaign speeches in the past eight months.\n\"You may hear me say a word or two about my friend Donald Trump but not my Democratic colleagues, who are serious people,\" Sanders said. He also pointed to the name-calling and candidates \"ripping into each other,\" which seems like a not-so-subtle hit at Trump.\nBut then only a few minutes later, Sanders criticized Clinton's campaign fundraising tactics and the spending of her super PAC, pointing out that he is proud to not have the support of an official super PAC. At the bottom of his official campaign emails, a note says, \"Paid for by Bernie, not the billionaires.\"\n\nSanders sharp tone comes as he has arisen as a serious threat to swipe the Democratic nomination from Clinton. Facing a possible repeat of 2008, Clinton has unloaded on Sanders as well -- painting him as an impractical radical and someone who could ultimately lose the White House for Democrats.\nClinton's latest hit was a letter from top diplomats questioning Sanders' ability to handle serious international situations, including relations with Iran. \n\"The stakes are high. And we are concerned that Sen. Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security,\" the diplomats wrote in their letter. \"His lack of a strategy for defeating ISIS -- one of the greatest challenges we face today -- is troubling. And the limited things he has said on ISIS are also troubling.\"\nAt a stop in Underwood, as Sanders took questions from the crowd, one woman pointed out to him that he's taking some heat for \"not having foreign policy experience.\" Sanders' defense rests in the logic that experience does not equal good judgment. \nHis example? Dick Cheney, who Sanders remarked, \"had a hell of a lot of experience, God help us all.\"\nBut much like the 2008 election where a fresh-faced senator touted his opposition against the war in Iraq, Sanders reminded the audience of Clinton's voting record on the matter, saying that she dutifully listened to Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld. \"She voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nMo Elleithee, former communications director for the Democratic Party and a veteran of numerous White House bids, including Clinton's 2008 run, said he doesn't think attacking Clinton will hurt Sanders -- unless he goes too far.\n\"Unless he crosses a line, I doubt it hurts him. On some level, he wants to be careful, he promises to be something to be different, at a certain point he can take it too far and look like everyone else,\" Elleithee said. \nHe added the last two weeks before the Iowa caucuses are when candidates want to excite supporters, but it also \"has the potential for backfiring if he looks too typical.\"","gunning_fog_3":"11.2","flesch_3":"11.1","readability_3":"56.59","index_4":"11","title_4":"Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator","url_4":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.\nAt the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.\nThey were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long.

Trump had a good enough campaign operation to win in Nevada. One thing Mr. Trump had going for him, I pointed out, was that he was very good at getting the news media to give him free airtime. \n\n“Every time he opens his mouth, he’s on national TV, telling jokes and giving his message — so he’s saved himself tens of millions of dollars doing that,” I said. Almost as soon as I finished making my point, the network demonstrated it by cutting to a Trump rally in Atlanta.\n\nSuch is the unusual world of Mr. Trump’s political finances. As a reporter who covers campaign finance, I spend my days trying to figure out where the money is. But Mr. Trump presents a different sort of challenge: Not so much where the money is, but where the money isn’t. \n\nThe only person who has spent less money running for president than Mr. Trump — and who hasn’t yet stopped running for president — is John Kasich. This is partly because Mr. Trump was famous in his own right before he plunged into the 2016 race. It is also partly because many of Mr. Trump’s campaign expenses, such as rides on his own private jets and helicopters, or borrowing aides from his real estate empire, get paid out to his own companies. \n\nBut even beyond that, it is because Mr. Trump doesn’t spend much on television ads, usually the single most expensive budget item for a modern presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump garners what political hacks call “earned media.” He holds big rallies, says provocative things that his audience adores — “I’d like to punch him in the face,” Mr. Trump said of a heckler at his event in Nevada on Monday — and reaps of a wave of news coverage in newspapers and on television. This dynamic has earned the scorn of Trump-haters on the right and left, who have taken to blaming the news media for enabling Mr. Trump’s rise. \n\nMr. Trump is undeniably a showman. Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a poll-tested message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the earned-media department, then proceeded to “trump” Mr. Trump, with a 20-minute riff on “squirmishes” and “proud clingers.”)\n\nJust how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals — Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz — are spending a combined $1.5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. \n\nMr. Trump’s bill?\n\nZero.","gunning_fog_5":"7.6","flesch_5":"5.2","readability_5":"82.65","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}},{"id":1952927300,"created_at":"2016-04-08T02:23:55+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T02:15:50+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"AE","city":"Apo","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915119,"worker_id":36871506,"trust":0.604166666666667,"worker_trust":0.913541666666667,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"2","q1":"0","q2":"0","q3":"-1","q4":"1","q5":"1","q6":"1","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"13","index_1":"90","title_1":"First Draft: Rudy Giuliani, Although Friends With Donald Trump, Is Not Ready to Endorse Yet","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/rudy-giuliani-although-friends-with-donald-trump-is-not-ready-to-endorse-yet/","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York,  is an admirer of Donald J. Trump and has been friends with him for decades. His endorsement could be useful to Mr. Trump, both as an affirmation in national security terms and an appeal to transplanted New Yorkers in Florida and elsewhere. \n\nBut while Mr. Giuliani speaks with Mr. Trump regularly, and has done so for months, he does not consider himself an adviser and is not yet ready to endorse any of the candidates. \n\n“I wouldn’t call it advising him,” Mr. Giuliani said in a telephone interview on Monday after a published report suggested he has recently emerged as a key adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani added, “I’m not sure who I’m going to endorse,” though he said he was open to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, but “not Cruz,” he said, referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump’s chief rival so far.\n\nMr. Giuliani was mayor for eight years and before that the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where Mr. Trump has been a major figure since the late 1980s. \n\n“I talk to him on a pretty regular basis,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I don’t consider myself an adviser. I’ve talked to Donald for 25 years. So I talk to him a lot anyway.” \n\nMr. Giuliani said he frequently spoke with Jeb Bush when he was a candidate, about as frequently as he did to Mr. Trump, and that he spoke more frequently with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with whom he is also friends. \n\nAs for Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani said he would call and offer his thoughts and advice on a range of topics. “Sometimes he takes it, sometimes he doesn’t,” Mr. Giuliani said. He told Mr. Trump that he thought his statement during his campaign kickoff speech that Mexican immigrants were rapists and were bringing crime into the country “was backwards,” although he thought he had “a pretty good point about illegal immigration.” \n\nHe said he also still considered former President George W. Bush “one of my heroes,” and disagreed with Mr. Trump’s assertions that the Bush administration has mishandled the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \n\nBut Mr. Giuliani, who was heralded for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and ran for president himself in 2008, said Mr. Trump had made a valuable case about China’s currency manipulation. He  said he also valued what Mr. Trump had said about the terrorism threats of the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Rubio are “more flexible people” than Mr.  Cruz, Mr. Giuliani said. “They’re not rigid ideologues.” \n\nHe added of Mr. Trump, “You don’t succeed in business by being a rigid ideologue.”","gunning_fog_1":"6.4","flesch_1":"4.0","readability_1":"85.69","index_2":"40","title_2":"Ted Cruz Starts to Crack G.O.P.

Scott Sewell seemed an unlikely figure to be attending a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz. An oil industry executive, Mr. Sewell served in President George Bush’s administration, lent a hand to George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential recount, and was twice a chairman for Mitt Romney’s Louisiana campaigns.\n\nBut if such a creature of the Republican establishment appeared an odd fit to support a candidate whose political identity was shaped challenging his party’s leadership, the candlelit, art-filled setting for Mr. Cruz’s reception was even more surprising: the elegant home of the longtime Bush loyalist Mary Matalin and her husband, James Carville, the Democratic strategist.\n\nThe vast majority of Republican elites remain bitterly opposed to the prospect of Mr. Cruz’s becoming the party’s presidential nominee, some even preferring to take their chances with Donald J. Trump. Yet, to the strains of a jazz trio a block from St. Charles Avenue here, over Texas barbecue at his Houston campaign office and in one of Washington’s see-and-be-seen steakhouses, Mr. Cruz, Washington’s chief anti-establishment agitator, has quietly begun wooing some of the party’s most entrenched donors and officials.\n\n“We’re working hard to consolidate a lot of support,” Mr. Cruz told a reporter as he mingled with guests arriving at Ms. Matalin’s home.\n\nSome in the old guard have started signaling to their reluctant right-of-center brethren that it is time to face the possibility that the hard-line Mr. Cruz could be their standard-bearer.\n\n“If Cruz makes it, which is very doable, every one of the establishment crowd who is now eviscerating him will line up, salute smartly and get on board,” Ms. Matalin said, offering a mix of prodding and prophecy. “No one will want to be responsible for a G.O.P. defeat.”\n\nThat even traces of détente have appeared between Mr. Cruz and the party’s traditional power brokers this early illustrates how thoroughly unpredictable the Republican race has been — and that, for major political donors, it can be safer to hedge one’s bets in such a volatile environment.\n\nBut others in the party hierarchy, including the officially neutral Ms. Matalin, either share some of the frustrations that have propelled Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump or at least recognize what the two have tapped into.\n\nThey also take him at his word. “I believe in Senator Cruz because he believes what he’s saying,” Mr. Sewell said outside the Matalin-Carville home, echoing sentiments often heard among the rank-and-file at Mr. Cruz’s Iowa gatherings.\n\nWhat is more striking, and will cause deep consternation among Republican strategists, is that other donors are beginning to embrace Mr. Cruz’s argument that he can win a general election by motivating core conservatives to come to the polls rather than by appealing to swing voters.\n\nAndrew Puzder, chief executive of the conglomerate that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., supported both of Mr. Romney’s campaigns and has contributed to a number of “super PACs” and candidates this year, including Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But after spending a couple of hours eating brisket with Mr. Cruz on Sunday at his campaign headquarters, Mr. Puzder said he was “very seriously considering” getting behind him, in part because of his appeal to the conservative base.\n\n“I’ve become a one-issue voter,” Mr. Puzder said. “My one issue is whether somebody is going to win. My big question is: What is your path to a general election victory?”\n\nUnhappily recalling that Mr. Romney won among self-described independents but still was soundly defeated by President Obama, Mr. Puzder said, “Part of the reason was that the base didn’t turn out to vote, and Senator Cruz understands that needs to happen.”\n\nThe theory of the missing conservative voter, central to Mr. Cruz’s pitch, has been widely and robustly challenged, including by figures on the right. But it is taking flight among some in the party’s donor class.\n\n“The reason Republicans lost in 2012 and 2008 is not because we lost swing voters,” Carla Sands, a California investor, wrote in an invitation to a $1,000-a-plate Los Angeles luncheon this week featuring Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi. “The reason Republicans lost is because they failed to motivate and turn out their base — mainly evangelical voters in states like Florida, Colorado and Pennsylvania who didn’t feel that the Republican nominee spoke to their issues.”\n\nMs. Sands, a philanthropist who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to establishment-aligned Republicans, predicted that “this election will also be a ‘base’ election, and we need a candidate who inspires and excites the base of our party to come out and vote.”\n\nMr. Cruz’s wife, who met him on the 2000 Bush campaign and worked in the administration, has emerged as something of a liaison to right-of-center donors. She headlined events in Atlanta; Austin, Dallas, Houston and Midland, Tex.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Seattle in November and December, helping Mr. Cruz raise nearly $20 million in the final quarter of the year — a haul expected to exceed those of any of the more establishment-friendly candidates.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz has other links to the party elites he has long railed against: Mr. Puzder was connected to him by Anthony R. Dolan, Ronald Reagan’s chief speechwriter, who is now part of Mr. Cruz’s team of advisers. Chad Sweet, Mr. Cruz’s campaign chairman, worked at Goldman Sachs and was chief of staff to Michael Chertoff, a Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush.\n\nMr. Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, has also cultivated relationships with the relatively small universe of Republican strategists. In December, he telephoned the lobbyist Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns, about arranging a get-acquainted meeting with him for Mr. Cruz when Congress returns this month (the meeting has not come about).\n\nMr. Cruz will, though, appear at a pair of fund-raisers in the Washington area next week that may lure some party regulars: a $1,000 per-person “happy hour” at the Capital Grille, followed by an event at the McLean, Va., home of Michael Adams, a former Bechtel Group executive.\n\nNot all of Mr. Cruz’s wooing has led to a love connection. Former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, who describes himself as “a RINO” — a Republican in name only — rode from the airport to a fund-raiser with Mr. Cruz when the Texas senator visited California last month.\n\n“He’s doing extremely well, which surprises me because I don’t think he’s as warm a personality as others,” Mr. Riordan said. “But he’s a very strong person.”\n\nThe response was more favorable in New Orleans, where Mr. Cruz drew younger Republicans and local figures like William Goldring, a distillery executive, the restaurateur Dickie Brennan and Rob Maness, who ran for the Senate here in 2014.\n\nMr. Cruz, who has wandered into trouble at some private events by saying things he does not say in public, mainly stuck to policy, according to two attendees. But he also spoke more personally than he often did on the stump, describing his connections to Louisiana and praising the city’s music and cuisine.\n\nHe even poked a bit of good-natured fun at his wife’s dietary preferences, describing “what it’s like to be from Texas and have Christmas dinner with vegetarians.”","gunning_fog_2":"8.0","flesch_2":"8.0","readability_2":"64.71","index_3":"24","title_3":"Sanders goes negative with Goldman Sachs, Iraq jabs","url_3":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/sanders-negative-goldman-sachs-iraq/index.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"CNN","top_topic_3":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_3":"Carroll, Iowa (CNN) Bernie Sanders has a new bus for the last two weeks before the all-important caucuses in Iowa and also a new strategy: attacking Hillary Clinton where she's most vulnerable. \nSanders has been inching there for months now, but he finally dropped the nice-guy routine this week -- and with an only slightly coy hit on knitting together Clinton's fabled speaking fees and her Wall Street connections.\n\"By the way, without naming any names, Goldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates,\" Sanders said, as the crowd chuckled. \"Very generous. Now I know that some of my opponents are very good speakers, very fine orators, very smart people, but you gotta be really really, really good to get $225,000 a speech. That's all I'll say.\"\nHe obviously did not need to name names; a member of the audience yelled, \"It was $600,000!\" \nSanders laughed and said, \"That's for three speeches.\" \nHis audience didn't seem to mind that the senator, who declared months ago that he wouldn't go negative, was now doing exactly that.\nAt the top of his speeches Tuesday in Fort Dodge and Carroll, Sanders spoke about the movement and revolution (as he likes to call it) that his campaign is bringing across America, boasting that 450,000 people have come to see his campaign speeches in the past eight months.\n\"You may hear me say a word or two about my friend Donald Trump but not my Democratic colleagues, who are serious people,\" Sanders said. He also pointed to the name-calling and candidates \"ripping into each other,\" which seems like a not-so-subtle hit at Trump.\nBut then only a few minutes later, Sanders criticized Clinton's campaign fundraising tactics and the spending of her super PAC, pointing out that he is proud to not have the support of an official super PAC. At the bottom of his official campaign emails, a note says, \"Paid for by Bernie, not the billionaires.\"\n\nSanders sharp tone comes as he has arisen as a serious threat to swipe the Democratic nomination from Clinton. Facing a possible repeat of 2008, Clinton has unloaded on Sanders as well -- painting him as an impractical radical and someone who could ultimately lose the White House for Democrats.\nClinton's latest hit was a letter from top diplomats questioning Sanders' ability to handle serious international situations, including relations with Iran. \n\"The stakes are high. And we are concerned that Sen. Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security,\" the diplomats wrote in their letter. \"His lack of a strategy for defeating ISIS -- one of the greatest challenges we face today -- is troubling. And the limited things he has said on ISIS are also troubling.\"\nAt a stop in Underwood, as Sanders took questions from the crowd, one woman pointed out to him that he's taking some heat for \"not having foreign policy experience.\" Sanders' defense rests in the logic that experience does not equal good judgment. \nHis example? Dick Cheney, who Sanders remarked, \"had a hell of a lot of experience, God help us all.\"\nBut much like the 2008 election where a fresh-faced senator touted his opposition against the war in Iraq, Sanders reminded the audience of Clinton's voting record on the matter, saying that she dutifully listened to Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld. \"She voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nMo Elleithee, former communications director for the Democratic Party and a veteran of numerous White House bids, including Clinton's 2008 run, said he doesn't think attacking Clinton will hurt Sanders -- unless he goes too far.\n\"Unless he crosses a line, I doubt it hurts him. On some level, he wants to be careful, he promises to be something to be different, at a certain point he can take it too far and look like everyone else,\" Elleithee said. \nHe added the last two weeks before the Iowa caucuses are when candidates want to excite supporters, but it also \"has the potential for backfiring if he looks too typical.\"","gunning_fog_3":"11.2","flesch_3":"11.1","readability_3":"56.59","index_4":"11","title_4":"Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator","url_4":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.\nAt the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.\nThey were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long.

Trump had a good enough campaign operation to win in Nevada. One thing Mr. Trump had going for him, I pointed out, was that he was very good at getting the news media to give him free airtime. \n\n“Every time he opens his mouth, he’s on national TV, telling jokes and giving his message — so he’s saved himself tens of millions of dollars doing that,” I said. Almost as soon as I finished making my point, the network demonstrated it by cutting to a Trump rally in Atlanta.\n\nSuch is the unusual world of Mr. Trump’s political finances. As a reporter who covers campaign finance, I spend my days trying to figure out where the money is. But Mr. Trump presents a different sort of challenge: Not so much where the money is, but where the money isn’t. \n\nThe only person who has spent less money running for president than Mr. Trump — and who hasn’t yet stopped running for president — is John Kasich. This is partly because Mr. Trump was famous in his own right before he plunged into the 2016 race. It is also partly because many of Mr. Trump’s campaign expenses, such as rides on his own private jets and helicopters, or borrowing aides from his real estate empire, get paid out to his own companies. \n\nBut even beyond that, it is because Mr. Trump doesn’t spend much on television ads, usually the single most expensive budget item for a modern presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump garners what political hacks call “earned media.” He holds big rallies, says provocative things that his audience adores — “I’d like to punch him in the face,” Mr. Trump said of a heckler at his event in Nevada on Monday — and reaps of a wave of news coverage in newspapers and on television. This dynamic has earned the scorn of Trump-haters on the right and left, who have taken to blaming the news media for enabling Mr. Trump’s rise. \n\nMr. Trump is undeniably a showman. Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a poll-tested message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the earned-media department, then proceeded to “trump” Mr. Trump, with a 20-minute riff on “squirmishes” and “proud clingers.”)\n\nJust how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals — Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz — are spending a combined $1.5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. \n\nMr. Trump’s bill?\n\nZero.","gunning_fog_5":"7.6","flesch_5":"5.2","readability_5":"82.65","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5217391304347825},"q1":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.8369565217391305},"q2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.8369565217391305},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6847826086956521},"q4":{"agg":"-2","confidence":0.5217391304347825},"q5":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5217391304347825},"q6":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q7":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.5217391304347825},"q8":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.6847826086956521},"q9":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5217391304347825},"q10":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.5217391304347825},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":0.8369565217391305},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"3049","confidence":0.5217391304347825},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"no_affiliation","confidence":0.5217391304347825},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"bernie_sanders","confidence":1.0}}}

As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative.

We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism.

Mr. Sanders on Saturday focused his remarks on economic inequality, campaign finance reform and Wall Street regulation, topics at the core of his candidacy.\n\n“People of Nevada know what Wall Street’s greed, irresponsibility, recklessness, and illegal behavior did,” Mr. Sanders said. “They did it all over this country but maybe no place more profoundly in terms of wrecking lives, than right here in Nevada.”\n\nThe senator also spoke to the crowd of 519 people about the importance of immigration reform and said he understands that many undocumented people are living in fear and need substantive legislation from the next president.\n\n“Today, we have 11 million people in this country who are undocumented,” Mr. Sanders said. “I have met people throughout this campaign, young people with tears running down their cheeks, who are literally worried that they or their parents will be deported tomorrow, that they will be separated from their loved ones. Count me in as somebody who will lead the effort for comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.”\n\nMr. Sanders added that if  “Congress does not do the job that it is supposed to do, then we will use the executive powers of the White House.” \n\nThe senator also touted his immigrant roots Saturday, reminding his volunteers that he grew up watching his family struggle financially.\n\n“My dad came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket from Poland, couldn’t speak English, never made much money,” Mr. Sanders said. “But he was as proud an American as you have ever seen because he saw what America gave to him and his kids, the kind of freedom and opportunity it gave.”\n\nLater, at a forum in Reno, he took questions from the crowd, including one about how he would help “indigenous people,” or Native Americans.\n\n“I have always stood with the oppressed people of this country and there are no people who have been more oppressed than the indigenous people of this country,” he said. “I will stand with you and do everything I can to bring dignity and respect and economic opportunity to those people who do not have it today.”\n\nMr. Sanders also hugged a woman who told him she was undocumented and feared she would be deported. “I will do everything that I humanely can to make sure you do not continue to live in fear,” he said.\n\nHe also reminded the crowd that he had voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law signed by President Bill Clinton that barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage, and which was largely overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013.","gunning_fog_5":"10.8","flesch_5":"10.7","readability_5":"57.61","gold_title":"The Seattle Times editorial board recommends John Kasich, Bernie Sanders","gold_url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-seattle-times-editorial-board-recommends-john-kasich-bernie-sanders/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Seattle Times","gold_body":"Authenticity and consistency are so rare in politics these days — no wonder a strong number of voters are supporting U.S. Sen.

Mr. Sanders on Saturday focused his remarks on economic inequality, campaign finance reform and Wall Street regulation, topics at the core of his candidacy.\n\n“People of Nevada know what Wall Street’s greed, irresponsibility, recklessness, and illegal behavior did,” Mr. Sanders said. “They did it all over this country but maybe no place more profoundly in terms of wrecking lives, than right here in Nevada.”\n\nThe senator also spoke to the crowd of 519 people about the importance of immigration reform and said he understands that many undocumented people are living in fear and need substantive legislation from the next president.\n\n“Today, we have 11 million people in this country who are undocumented,” Mr. Sanders said. “I have met people throughout this campaign, young people with tears running down their cheeks, who are literally worried that they or their parents will be deported tomorrow, that they will be separated from their loved ones. Count me in as somebody who will lead the effort for comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.”\n\nMr. Sanders added that if  “Congress does not do the job that it is supposed to do, then we will use the executive powers of the White House.” \n\nThe senator also touted his immigrant roots Saturday, reminding his volunteers that he grew up watching his family struggle financially.\n\n“My dad came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket from Poland, couldn’t speak English, never made much money,” Mr. Sanders said. “But he was as proud an American as you have ever seen because he saw what America gave to him and his kids, the kind of freedom and opportunity it gave.”\n\nLater, at a forum in Reno, he took questions from the crowd, including one about how he would help “indigenous people,” or Native Americans.\n\n“I have always stood with the oppressed people of this country and there are no people who have been more oppressed than the indigenous people of this country,” he said. “I will stand with you and do everything I can to bring dignity and respect and economic opportunity to those people who do not have it today.”\n\nMr. Sanders also hugged a woman who told him she was undocumented and feared she would be deported. “I will do everything that I humanely can to make sure you do not continue to live in fear,” he said.\n\nHe also reminded the crowd that he had voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law signed by President Bill Clinton that barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage, and which was largely overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013.","gunning_fog_5":"10.8","flesch_5":"10.7","readability_5":"57.61","gold_title":"The Seattle Times editorial board recommends John Kasich, Bernie Sanders","gold_url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-seattle-times-editorial-board-recommends-john-kasich-bernie-sanders/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Seattle Times","gold_body":"Authenticity and consistency are so rare in politics these days — no wonder a strong number of voters are supporting U.S. Sen.

Instead, the GOP is now facing an existential crisis not seen in more than a generation as much of the party leadership and many of its top figures are in open revolt against Trump's candidacy heading into Super Tuesday.\nThe potential liabilities lurking in Trump's background are hardly a secret. The real estate magnate's occasional business failings and colorful personal life have filled the pages of New York tabloids for decades.\nStoring its ammunition for the general election, one pro-Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has taken a few jabs at Trump, choosing instead to portray the businessman as a reflection of the Republican Party.\n\"Trump is no fluke. Nor is he hijacking the Republican Party or the conservative movement,\" wrote Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky in an email to reporters. \"He is, rather, the party's creation, its Frankenstein monster.\"\nA Trump rival, Marco Rubio, has only recently decided to tap that treasure trove of opposition research. That offensive, however, only began in earnest at last week's Republican debate as Rubio mocked Trump's inheritance and legal troubles facing the real estate academy launched by his the tycoon's vast organization.\nThe Democrats' looming business boogeyman assault on Trump is nearly identical to the attack leveled at the last GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, whose financial firm Bain Capital was savaged by pro-Obama super PACs over its practice of downsizing manufacturers for profit.\nInside the pro-Clinton super PAC-world, the Republican establishment's miscalculation is viewed as a tactical error of epic proportions.\n\"Amazing. They just froze,\" the PAC aligned strategist said, requesting anonymity.\nNo candidacy better illustrates GOP's painful lesson, in the minds of several top GOP advisers, than that of Jeb Bush. \nAs Trump delighted in pointing out at every one of his rallies, the former Florida governor and his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, both amassed a war chest capable of annihilating any potential rival. But instead of directing that arsenal at Trump, Bush and his allies chose to target fellow establishment figures, especially Rubio.\n\"The civilized world raised an army and entrusted it to Right to Rise PAC,\" said Stuart Stevens, Romney's former campaign manager. \"Instead of fighting barbarians, they decided to try and kill everybody who agrees with them. Crazy. Just crazy.\"\n\"The Right to Rise thing is historically bad,\" he added.\nStevens, a key figure in Romney's political world, has brutally attacked the GOP front-runner on Twitter. \n\"It's becoming obvious that supporting or not supporting (Trump) isn't a political choice. It's a moral choice. The man is evil,\" he said.\nTrump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, brushed off the party's concerns about his candidate. \n\"I worry about everything,\" Lewandowski quipped. \nRubio's calculated, yet harsh attack on Trump came only hours after Romney challenged the billionaire businessman to release his tax returns. Trump responded with a slew of insults aimed at Romney on Friday, remarking that the former Massachusetts governor had no hopes of winning in 2012 because he \"walked like a duck.\"\nOn Monday, Romney tweeted that Trump's inability to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan on CNN's \"State of the Union\" as disqualifying.\nAs for Bush, he was hardly the only candidate to engage in Trump denial. \nTed Cruz, who has also raised a vast fortune in contributions, studiously avoided contact with the GOP front-runner for much of 2015, hopeful that Trump would self-destruct and releasing his angry anti-establishment electorate in search of safe harbor. \nThe famously tough-talking Chris Christie grumbled to reporters time and again that he would not attack Trump, only doing so before dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor is now arguably Trump's most senior establishment supporter.\nAlso underestimated was the anger brewing on the margins of the American economic recovery. Working-class voters who are simply too conservative to support a self-declared democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders are flocking to Trump's message that illegal immigration and bad trade deals are decimating the heartland.\nTrump has dubbed these boisterous followers, who stuff themselves into arenas and auditoriums, the \"noisy majority.\" \nAnd while they may actually have the energy and enthusiasm to sweep Trump and the Republican Party back into the White House, many in the GOP hierarchy are predicting easy pickings for Democrats and associated super PACs come November.\nAnother top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, sees the rise of Trump as a logical extension of the tea party movement, which is highly capable of putting conservatives in Congress, but is a turnoff to more moderate, suburban voters in presidential elections. \n\"This is the natural consequence of 2009 and 2010,\" said the strategist. \"We co-opted a movement made up largely of the least informed voters. We got significant short-term political gain, but in the process empowered a group that has little interest in reason.\"\n\"We reap what we sow,\" the strategist said.\nTrump is equally disdainful of his Republican critics. The celebrity magnate, who authored \"The Art of the Deal,\" routinely lambastes GOP leaders in Congress over the recent budget deal with the White House. Trump insists he will broker better agreements as president by simply walking away from the negotiating table when necessary.\nAt times, Trump has sought to ease tensions within the Republican Party over his superheated rhetoric on immigration. He often highlights his standing in the polls with Latino voters and praises the Hispanic employees who work at his hotels.\nBut senior GOP advisers privately worry the damage is done.\n\"The bubble will crash at some point, but I fear we will be tatters by the time it does,\" one top Republican congressional aide said.","gunning_fog_1":"10.0","flesch_1":"12.3","readability_1":"42.72","index_2":"66","title_2":"Clinton Super PAC Ramps Up Spending Ahead of Next Round of Primaries","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/clinton-super-pac-ramps-up-spending-ahead-of-next-round-of-primaries/","candidate_2":"Hillary Clinton","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"The pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC is ramping up its spending ahead of a series of nominating contests, following Mrs. Clinton’s loss in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, is running a $500,000 radio ad campaign promoting Mrs. Clinton in South Carolina, where Democrats vote Feb. 27. The ad casts Mrs. Clinton as best equipped to continue President Barack Obama‘s policies and praises her experience and record.\nIt is also launching a $4.5 million radio, digital and mail ad campaign to boost early turnout by black, Latino and female voters in states with March primaries. The effort will be implemented together with the environmental group League of Conservation Voters and Emily’s List, which promotes female pro-choice candidates.\nThe burst in spending by Priorities, which had originally intended to save its funds for the general election, suggests Clinton allies are concerned about the tougher-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Following her loss by more than 20 points in New Hampshire and her razor-thin win in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton needs victories in Nevada and South Carolina.\nPriorities raised $41 million in 2015, and another $10 million through January. It previously spent about $400,000 boosting Mrs. Clinton in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early-nominating states. It has not spent any money attacking Mr. Sanders.\nPriorities officials said they expect the early voting campaign to target all March states, and said it will focus on states with in-person early voting such as Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina.\nGuy Cecil, the super PAC’s chief strategist, said he expects the campaign to boost Mrs. Clinton in both the general and the primary elections. “We have always seen as our primary responsibility the general election, making sure that Hillary wins, and we have always thought we would assess where we were, to make sure we were doing everything possible to build a long-term coalition for her campaign,” he said in a written statement.\nThe super PAC spending has already drawn criticism from Mr. Sanders. In a message to supporters on Friday, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said, “It is truly unfortunate that the largest pro-Clinton super PAC has decided to infect the Democratic primary process with its haul of Wall Street cash.”\nMr. Sanders also has received at least $1.5 million in backing from a super PAC run by the nurses union, filings with the Federal Election Commission show.","gunning_fog_2":"8.4","flesch_2":"8.4","readability_2":"63.7","index_3":"15","title_3":"Bernie Sanders Is Democrats’ Top Beneficiary of Outside Spending, Like it or Not","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-is-democrats-top-beneficiary-of-outside-spending-like-it-or-not.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"DES MOINES — As he swung through Iowa this week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont rarely passed up a chance to bash the rising tide of money in politics, a system he said on Tuesday was “corrupt and undermining American democracy.”\n\nAt many of these stops, he was accompanied by members of National Nurses United, a seven-year-old union, fanning out from a bright-red bus in matching red scrubs to corral potential Sanders votes.\n\nBut the union is not just busing nurses into Iowa. The union’s “super PAC” has spent close to $1 million on ads and other support for Mr. Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate who has inspired liberal voters with his calls to eradicate such outside groups. In fact, more super PAC money has been spent so far in express support of Mr. Sanders than for either of his Democratic rivals, including Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\n“I do appreciate the irony,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United. “All things being equal, we would rather not be doing this. On the other hand, we want to see Bernie as president.”\n\nMr. Sander’s unlikely rise to super PAC pre-eminence is, in part, the story of an unusual alignment of strategies by different outside groups, including Republican ones eager to bloody Mrs. Clinton and lift Mr. Sanders, whom conservatives believe will be easier to defeat in a general election. While the nurses’ super PAC is the biggest left-leaning outside spender in the Democratic primary, conservative organizations have also spent at least $4.3 million attacking Mrs. Clinton in recent months.\n\nOne recent online ad from the Republican super PAC American Crossroads has assailed Mrs. Clinton for her Wall Street speaking fees — echoing an argument Mr. Sanders often makes against her. Another conservative group, Ending Spending, bankrolled by the Wyoming billionaire Joe Ricketts, has begun a $600,000 campaign in Iowa highlighting Mr. Sanders’s promises to raise taxes on the rich and provide free public college tuition, calling him “too liberal for Iowa.” But the ad’s language and imagery, including a contented-looking superrich couple hugging in front of a mansion and expensive cars, has led some Democrats to believe it is actually meant to bolster Mr. Sanders.\n\nBut the super PAC spending by the nurses union also underscores an aspect of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that Mr. Sanders rarely dwells on in his campaign speeches attacking the ruling. The same decision that gave corporations the ability to “buy and purchase the United States government” — as Mr. Sanders put it during a visit to Grinnell College on Monday — bestowed the same rights on labor unions, freeing them to spend unlimited money from their treasuries on election advertising.\n\nWhile the vast majority of super PAC money still comes from wealthy individuals, union cash — pooled from the dues and contributions of members — has become a critical source of money for outside groups on the left. In 2012 and 2014, unions contributed more than $200 million to super PACs. More than half of it went to union-controlled groups that spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising, mailers, and other “independent expenditures.” So far in 2016, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, seven of the top 20 organizational contributors to super PACs were unions or their affiliates, rather than corporations.\n\n“When you have hundreds of thousands or millions of dues-paying members, you can wield a significant amount of influence,” said Robert McGuire, an investigator at the center. “It’s the flip side of a lot of other spending we’re seeing this days.”\n\nNo union has spent as much money in the Democratic primary as National Nurses United, which was born out of a 2009 merger of three smaller unions and has unapologetically embraced liberal politics and movement-building. In 2011, union nurses provided health care at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Lower Manhattan, and the organization has lobbied forcefully for single-payer health care and a financial transaction tax.\n\nWhen most large labor organizations backed Mrs. Clinton, the nurses were among a handful to support Mr. Sanders, among them the Communications Workers of America and the postal workers’ union. They are guided, the nurses’ leaders say, by the principle that taking care of patients means taking care of the country, too.\n\n“This sick government we have right now is killing our democracy,” said Jean Ross, a Minnesota nurse now serving as of the group’s three co-presidents, at a Sanders event in Des Moines on Tuesday. The union’s bus stood outside a steelworkers union hall, where the red scrubs worn by the nurses speckled a room full of Carhartt jackets and denim. At any given time, as many as 30 nurses from around the country are on the campaign trail helping Mr. Sanders, rotating in on vacation days and weekends.\n\n“We have a bus, he has a bus,” Ms. Ross said gaily. “Nurses get on, nurses get off.”\n\nThe group’s campaigning advocacy for Mr. Sanders has drawn charges of hypocrisy from Mrs. Clinton’s supporters. While Mr. Sanders frequently declares that he has no super PAC of his own, he has not publicly called on the nurses to refrain from their efforts on his behalf. He has welcomed their help, thanking the nurses by name in campaign speeches and referring to the union in one recent appearance as a “one of the sponsors” of his campaign.\n\n“This is one of the prime examples of Senator Sanders saying one thing and doing another,” said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. “For months he had criticized super PACs and pledged to shun them in his campaign, but all along he has benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars in independent expenditures from one of those very organizations.”\n\nMr. Sanders insists there is no contradiction.\n\n“The difference is a pretty simple difference,” Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday. “Hillary Clinton goes out raising money for her own super PAC. I don’t have a super PAC, and in the best of all possible worlds, which I hope to bring about, we will get rid of super PACs, we will overturn Citizens United.”\n\nMrs. Clinton has indeed helped raise money for a super PAC: Priorities USA Action, a group originally formed to help re-elect President Obama and now run by a former Clinton campaign aide. The group has raised more than $40 million since the beginning of last year, including seven-figure contributions from the kind of billionaire financiers Mr. Sanders delights in lampooning on the campaign trail. A research and rapid-response super PAC, Correct the Record, founded by the Clinton ally David Brock and funded by wealthy liberals, has also taken swipes at Mr. Sanders in recent days over his record on gun control.\n\nPriorities USA has continued to husband most of its money for later in the campaign, however, in anticipation of a major general election battle with Mrs. Clinton as the nominee. Several other liberal groups have spent money on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, including Planned Parenthood’s political arm and the League of Conservation Voters. But those expenditures totaled only $847,000, according to spending reported to the elections commission through Monday, less than the amount spent by the nurses’ super PAC, National Nurses United for Patient Protection.\n\nMs. DeMoro, the nurses’ union official, scoffed at any comparison between the two efforts, one by nurses, the other by a political operative.\n\n“This is almost a morality play,” Ms. DeMoro said. “It’s Clinton’s David Brock versus Bernie’s nurses.”","gunning_fog_3":"9.2","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"61.67","index_4":"118","title_4":"2nd former Mexican president unloads on Donald Trump","url_4":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/6fZtc76vZuA/2nd-former-mexican-president-unloads-on-donald-trump.html","candidate_4":"Donald Trump","org_4":"Fox News","top_topic_4":"Immigration","body_4":"MEXICO CITY –  Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday joined his predecessor in office in unloading on Donald Trump, calling the Republican front-runner's campaign racist and saying his discourse on immigration is fueling anti-American sentiment around the world.\nCalderon, a conservative who was president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, even said he thought Trump was trying to exploit the same social feelings and resentments as did Adolf Hitler.\n\"I think his logic of exalting white supremacy isn't even acting against immigration — Donald Trump is the descendant of migrants — it is acting and speaking against immigrants who have a different skin color than him, which is frankly racist and is a bit like the exploitation of sensitive fibers that Hitler did in his day,\" Calderon told reporters after a meeting of the National Action Party, or PAN, in Mexico City.\nCalderon's comments parallel those made earlier by former President Vicente Fox, who preceded Calderon in office and also belonged to the PAN party.\nIn interviews with Univision and Mexican media, Fox called Trump \"crazy,\" a \"false prophet\" and an embarrassment to his party.

Here I’ll draw on an argument between two liberals, ruminating on how the possibility of a Trump nomination should be regarded on the left. On the one hand, Jonathan Chait has made the case that his fellow liberals should cheer Trump on, not only because he’s unlikely to win a general election but also because it wouldn’t be so bad if he did, since he’d be a much more ideologically-unsettled figure than a President Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, and thus more likely to cut deals with Democrats and generally govern from some kind of center. As a hopeful example, he invokes as a Trumpian forerunner Arnold Schwarzenegger, another misogynist celebrity demagogue who ended up as “a highly effective governor” because all he cared about was his popularity, which made him much more willing to work across party lines.\n\nThen for a counterpoint, there’s Ezra Klein, who concedes that we can’t know what a Trump White House would mean for public policy, but argues that liberals (and everyone else) should find him “terrifying” nonetheless, for reasons that have less to do with the specifics of what he might stand for than with how unbound he is from normal conventions and restraints:\n\nTrump’s other gift … is his complete lack of shame. It’s easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they’re exposed as liars, when they’re seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.\n\nTrump doesn’t. He has the reality television star’s ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won’t, to say what others can’t, to do what others wouldn’t.\n\nTrump lives by the reality television trope that he’s not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they’re not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. “I’m not here to make friends” is another way of saying, “I’m not bound by the social conventions of normal people.” The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.\n\nThis, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field … But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do — or what he wouldn’t do.\n\nThis seems, unfortunately, mostly right. I’m not “terrified” of Trump because fool that I am, I still don’t think he’ll be the Republican nominee. But I don’t think anyone, right or left, should feel sanguine about what he represents, or about the prospect of having someone so unrestrained elected to an office that’s increasingly lacking in effective formal restraints upon its powers.\n\nThe Schwarzenegger example does show that a major American state’s government can survive a Trump-like figure at the helm. But first of all the idea that Arnie was “highly effective” because he did some things that liberals like is a little strange, since he spent his second term presiding ineffectually over a period of constant, gridlocked budget crises and left office with approval ratings in the 20s. (At best you could argue that he was a merciful failure as a strongman.) And second, when it comes to celebrity-infused demagoguery Schwarzenegger was Trump-like but also Trump-lite: For all his coarseness he did tone things down, not up, during his campaign and subsequent administration, trying to play at least somewhat by normal political rules. Yes, there was talk of “girlie men” and racially-charged remarks, and he delighted in striking action-hero poses. But there was nothing quite like Trump’s constant doubling down on norm-breaching and taboo-busting, no Schwarzeneggerian equivalent of the promises to ban Muslims and torture the relatives of terrorists …\n\n… and even if there had been, the governorship of California is just not that powerful an office, whereas the presidency of the United States has been growing more powerful and less constrained by traditional norms with every passing administration. One need not pass judgment on individual presidents and their policies to recognize this trend, and to expect it to continue regardless of which party wins in 2016. In that context, a successful man-on-horseback candidacy, in which a president is elected on whose selling point is that he refuses to bow to convention or restraint, is precisely the kind of thing that could expose some of the underlying perils inherent in our system, and accelerate America’s march toward either Caesarism or crisis.\n\nThe best case scenario — for the republic, if not for public policy — might be that such a president would simply be a failure, an instant John Tyler-esque lame duck with both parties maneuvering to replace him from day one; the worst case is some sort of constitutional crisis, except with a president far less likely than Richard Nixon to bow to the Beltway consensus and give way.\n\nNow probably a Trump presidency would fall somewhere in between those two possibilities; probably he really would be a little less over-the-top in office than he has been on the trail. (In order to win a general election, clearly, he would need to adapt and become, well, a little more politically correct.) But a Trumpian four years would almost certainly involve a significant degradation of the unwritten restraints on presidential conduct, an acceleration of royalist tendencies that may be built into our system but still deserve to be slowed down, and a blurring of reality-TV and political culture that takes us several leagues further along the road to President Camacho. I don’t think that the nebulous possibility of dealmaking should tempt liberals to welcome this kind of experiment; I don’t think the hope of a more working-class-friendly G.O.P. should tempt conservative reformers to learn to love it either. And the fact that recent presidents have already pushed the envelope in all kinds of troubling ways is not a “what’s the big deal” case for accepting Trumpism: Noting that George W. Bush approved waterboarding (while insisting that we don’t torture) or that Barack Obama launched wars without congressional approval (while denying they were real wars) is not a case for electing a candidate who’s gleeful in his promises to torture with abandon and rob other countries of their oil; rather, it’s a warning of what the office does to men who are restrained by norms and rules and the tribute that executive vice still has to pay to constitutional virtue.\n\nThe only case for actively embracing a figure like Trump, it seems to me, is if he were the only candidate willing to address a crisis or challenge that’s so existentially or absolutely important that it’s worth gambling our ragged republican norms to see it successfully resolved. This is the vibe I get from certain immigration restrictionists, from the Ann Coulter-Mickey Kaus cohort to, well, more insalubrious voices on the web. And frankly if America were in Germany’s position right now, and voting Trump was the only alternative to admitting 500,000-1,000,000 Middle Eastern migrants every year in perpetuity and/or tearing the country’s politics apart, I might find the case for the Donald a little more persuasive. But one can oppose Rubio-Schumer and other “comprehensive” immigration reforms (and I’ve written a lot of words in opposition) and still recognize 1) that the problems with America’s immigration policy do not pose an existential threat to the republic  and 2) that Trump is about as likely to be a reliable immigration hawk in office as he is to be a reliable anything, which is to say not very. (He’ll boost deportations and build a wall in the first year, sure — but as he’s already promised, it’ll have the biggest, most luxurious door you’ve ever seen.)\n\nWhich is why it’s one thing for people dissatisfied with Conservatism, Inc. and the G.O.P. to be anti-anti-Trump — as I’ve been in the past, and will be again if he fades — and urge the party to take his challenge seriously and co-opt some of his gestures and ideas. But it’s quite another to be actively pro-Trump: Welcoming a would-be strongman because he’s pandering to you on a single issue rarely turns out well, and a vote for the rhinoceros is usually just a good way to end up gored.","gunning_fog_5":"15.2","flesch_5":"16.2","readability_5":"37.98","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton Is Fundamentally Honest and Trustworthy","gold_url":"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/hillary-clinton-fundamentally-honest-and-trustworthy","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"Mother Jones","gold_body":"As we all know, millennials don't care much for Hillary Clinton. That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.

Instead, the GOP is now facing an existential crisis not seen in more than a generation as much of the party leadership and many of its top figures are in open revolt against Trump's candidacy heading into Super Tuesday.\nThe potential liabilities lurking in Trump's background are hardly a secret. The real estate magnate's occasional business failings and colorful personal life have filled the pages of New York tabloids for decades.\nStoring its ammunition for the general election, one pro-Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has taken a few jabs at Trump, choosing instead to portray the businessman as a reflection of the Republican Party.\n\"Trump is no fluke. Nor is he hijacking the Republican Party or the conservative movement,\" wrote Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky in an email to reporters. \"He is, rather, the party's creation, its Frankenstein monster.\"\nA Trump rival, Marco Rubio, has only recently decided to tap that treasure trove of opposition research. That offensive, however, only began in earnest at last week's Republican debate as Rubio mocked Trump's inheritance and legal troubles facing the real estate academy launched by his the tycoon's vast organization.\nThe Democrats' looming business boogeyman assault on Trump is nearly identical to the attack leveled at the last GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, whose financial firm Bain Capital was savaged by pro-Obama super PACs over its practice of downsizing manufacturers for profit.\nInside the pro-Clinton super PAC-world, the Republican establishment's miscalculation is viewed as a tactical error of epic proportions.\n\"Amazing. They just froze,\" the PAC aligned strategist said, requesting anonymity.\nNo candidacy better illustrates GOP's painful lesson, in the minds of several top GOP advisers, than that of Jeb Bush. \nAs Trump delighted in pointing out at every one of his rallies, the former Florida governor and his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, both amassed a war chest capable of annihilating any potential rival. But instead of directing that arsenal at Trump, Bush and his allies chose to target fellow establishment figures, especially Rubio.\n\"The civilized world raised an army and entrusted it to Right to Rise PAC,\" said Stuart Stevens, Romney's former campaign manager. \"Instead of fighting barbarians, they decided to try and kill everybody who agrees with them. Crazy. Just crazy.\"\n\"The Right to Rise thing is historically bad,\" he added.\nStevens, a key figure in Romney's political world, has brutally attacked the GOP front-runner on Twitter. \n\"It's becoming obvious that supporting or not supporting (Trump) isn't a political choice. It's a moral choice. The man is evil,\" he said.\nTrump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, brushed off the party's concerns about his candidate. \n\"I worry about everything,\" Lewandowski quipped. \nRubio's calculated, yet harsh attack on Trump came only hours after Romney challenged the billionaire businessman to release his tax returns. Trump responded with a slew of insults aimed at Romney on Friday, remarking that the former Massachusetts governor had no hopes of winning in 2012 because he \"walked like a duck.\"\nOn Monday, Romney tweeted that Trump's inability to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan on CNN's \"State of the Union\" as disqualifying.\nAs for Bush, he was hardly the only candidate to engage in Trump denial. \nTed Cruz, who has also raised a vast fortune in contributions, studiously avoided contact with the GOP front-runner for much of 2015, hopeful that Trump would self-destruct and releasing his angry anti-establishment electorate in search of safe harbor. \nThe famously tough-talking Chris Christie grumbled to reporters time and again that he would not attack Trump, only doing so before dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor is now arguably Trump's most senior establishment supporter.\nAlso underestimated was the anger brewing on the margins of the American economic recovery. Working-class voters who are simply too conservative to support a self-declared democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders are flocking to Trump's message that illegal immigration and bad trade deals are decimating the heartland.\nTrump has dubbed these boisterous followers, who stuff themselves into arenas and auditoriums, the \"noisy majority.\" \nAnd while they may actually have the energy and enthusiasm to sweep Trump and the Republican Party back into the White House, many in the GOP hierarchy are predicting easy pickings for Democrats and associated super PACs come November.\nAnother top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, sees the rise of Trump as a logical extension of the tea party movement, which is highly capable of putting conservatives in Congress, but is a turnoff to more moderate, suburban voters in presidential elections. \n\"This is the natural consequence of 2009 and 2010,\" said the strategist. \"We co-opted a movement made up largely of the least informed voters. We got significant short-term political gain, but in the process empowered a group that has little interest in reason.\"\n\"We reap what we sow,\" the strategist said.\nTrump is equally disdainful of his Republican critics. The celebrity magnate, who authored \"The Art of the Deal,\" routinely lambastes GOP leaders in Congress over the recent budget deal with the White House. Trump insists he will broker better agreements as president by simply walking away from the negotiating table when necessary.\nAt times, Trump has sought to ease tensions within the Republican Party over his superheated rhetoric on immigration. He often highlights his standing in the polls with Latino voters and praises the Hispanic employees who work at his hotels.\nBut senior GOP advisers privately worry the damage is done.\n\"The bubble will crash at some point, but I fear we will be tatters by the time it does,\" one top Republican congressional aide said.","gunning_fog_1":"10.0","flesch_1":"12.3","readability_1":"42.72","index_2":"66","title_2":"Clinton Super PAC Ramps Up Spending Ahead of Next Round of Primaries","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/clinton-super-pac-ramps-up-spending-ahead-of-next-round-of-primaries/","candidate_2":"Hillary Clinton","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"The pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC is ramping up its spending ahead of a series of nominating contests, following Mrs. Clinton’s loss in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, is running a $500,000 radio ad campaign promoting Mrs. Clinton in South Carolina, where Democrats vote Feb. 27. The ad casts Mrs. Clinton as best equipped to continue President Barack Obama‘s policies and praises her experience and record.\nIt is also launching a $4.5 million radio, digital and mail ad campaign to boost early turnout by black, Latino and female voters in states with March primaries. The effort will be implemented together with the environmental group League of Conservation Voters and Emily’s List, which promotes female pro-choice candidates.\nThe burst in spending by Priorities, which had originally intended to save its funds for the general election, suggests Clinton allies are concerned about the tougher-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Following her loss by more than 20 points in New Hampshire and her razor-thin win in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton needs victories in Nevada and South Carolina.\nPriorities raised $41 million in 2015, and another $10 million through January. It previously spent about $400,000 boosting Mrs. Clinton in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early-nominating states. It has not spent any money attacking Mr. Sanders.\nPriorities officials said they expect the early voting campaign to target all March states, and said it will focus on states with in-person early voting such as Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina.\nGuy Cecil, the super PAC’s chief strategist, said he expects the campaign to boost Mrs. Clinton in both the general and the primary elections. “We have always seen as our primary responsibility the general election, making sure that Hillary wins, and we have always thought we would assess where we were, to make sure we were doing everything possible to build a long-term coalition for her campaign,” he said in a written statement.\nThe super PAC spending has already drawn criticism from Mr. Sanders. In a message to supporters on Friday, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said, “It is truly unfortunate that the largest pro-Clinton super PAC has decided to infect the Democratic primary process with its haul of Wall Street cash.”\nMr. Sanders also has received at least $1.5 million in backing from a super PAC run by the nurses union, filings with the Federal Election Commission show.","gunning_fog_2":"8.4","flesch_2":"8.4","readability_2":"63.7","index_3":"15","title_3":"Bernie Sanders Is Democrats’ Top Beneficiary of Outside Spending, Like it or Not","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-is-democrats-top-beneficiary-of-outside-spending-like-it-or-not.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"DES MOINES — As he swung through Iowa this week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont rarely passed up a chance to bash the rising tide of money in politics, a system he said on Tuesday was “corrupt and undermining American democracy.”\n\nAt many of these stops, he was accompanied by members of National Nurses United, a seven-year-old union, fanning out from a bright-red bus in matching red scrubs to corral potential Sanders votes.\n\nBut the union is not just busing nurses into Iowa. The union’s “super PAC” has spent close to $1 million on ads and other support for Mr. Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate who has inspired liberal voters with his calls to eradicate such outside groups. In fact, more super PAC money has been spent so far in express support of Mr. Sanders than for either of his Democratic rivals, including Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\n“I do appreciate the irony,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United. “All things being equal, we would rather not be doing this. On the other hand, we want to see Bernie as president.”\n\nMr. Sander’s unlikely rise to super PAC pre-eminence is, in part, the story of an unusual alignment of strategies by different outside groups, including Republican ones eager to bloody Mrs. Clinton and lift Mr. Sanders, whom conservatives believe will be easier to defeat in a general election. While the nurses’ super PAC is the biggest left-leaning outside spender in the Democratic primary, conservative organizations have also spent at least $4.3 million attacking Mrs. Clinton in recent months.\n\nOne recent online ad from the Republican super PAC American Crossroads has assailed Mrs. Clinton for her Wall Street speaking fees — echoing an argument Mr. Sanders often makes against her. Another conservative group, Ending Spending, bankrolled by the Wyoming billionaire Joe Ricketts, has begun a $600,000 campaign in Iowa highlighting Mr. Sanders’s promises to raise taxes on the rich and provide free public college tuition, calling him “too liberal for Iowa.” But the ad’s language and imagery, including a contented-looking superrich couple hugging in front of a mansion and expensive cars, has led some Democrats to believe it is actually meant to bolster Mr. Sanders.\n\nBut the super PAC spending by the nurses union also underscores an aspect of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that Mr. Sanders rarely dwells on in his campaign speeches attacking the ruling. The same decision that gave corporations the ability to “buy and purchase the United States government” — as Mr. Sanders put it during a visit to Grinnell College on Monday — bestowed the same rights on labor unions, freeing them to spend unlimited money from their treasuries on election advertising.\n\nWhile the vast majority of super PAC money still comes from wealthy individuals, union cash — pooled from the dues and contributions of members — has become a critical source of money for outside groups on the left. In 2012 and 2014, unions contributed more than $200 million to super PACs. More than half of it went to union-controlled groups that spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising, mailers, and other “independent expenditures.” So far in 2016, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, seven of the top 20 organizational contributors to super PACs were unions or their affiliates, rather than corporations.\n\n“When you have hundreds of thousands or millions of dues-paying members, you can wield a significant amount of influence,” said Robert McGuire, an investigator at the center. “It’s the flip side of a lot of other spending we’re seeing this days.”\n\nNo union has spent as much money in the Democratic primary as National Nurses United, which was born out of a 2009 merger of three smaller unions and has unapologetically embraced liberal politics and movement-building. In 2011, union nurses provided health care at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Lower Manhattan, and the organization has lobbied forcefully for single-payer health care and a financial transaction tax.\n\nWhen most large labor organizations backed Mrs. Clinton, the nurses were among a handful to support Mr. Sanders, among them the Communications Workers of America and the postal workers’ union. They are guided, the nurses’ leaders say, by the principle that taking care of patients means taking care of the country, too.\n\n“This sick government we have right now is killing our democracy,” said Jean Ross, a Minnesota nurse now serving as of the group’s three co-presidents, at a Sanders event in Des Moines on Tuesday. The union’s bus stood outside a steelworkers union hall, where the red scrubs worn by the nurses speckled a room full of Carhartt jackets and denim. At any given time, as many as 30 nurses from around the country are on the campaign trail helping Mr. Sanders, rotating in on vacation days and weekends.\n\n“We have a bus, he has a bus,” Ms. Ross said gaily. “Nurses get on, nurses get off.”\n\nThe group’s campaigning advocacy for Mr. Sanders has drawn charges of hypocrisy from Mrs. Clinton’s supporters. While Mr. Sanders frequently declares that he has no super PAC of his own, he has not publicly called on the nurses to refrain from their efforts on his behalf. He has welcomed their help, thanking the nurses by name in campaign speeches and referring to the union in one recent appearance as a “one of the sponsors” of his campaign.\n\n“This is one of the prime examples of Senator Sanders saying one thing and doing another,” said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. “For months he had criticized super PACs and pledged to shun them in his campaign, but all along he has benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars in independent expenditures from one of those very organizations.”\n\nMr. Sanders insists there is no contradiction.\n\n“The difference is a pretty simple difference,” Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday. “Hillary Clinton goes out raising money for her own super PAC. I don’t have a super PAC, and in the best of all possible worlds, which I hope to bring about, we will get rid of super PACs, we will overturn Citizens United.”\n\nMrs. Clinton has indeed helped raise money for a super PAC: Priorities USA Action, a group originally formed to help re-elect President Obama and now run by a former Clinton campaign aide. The group has raised more than $40 million since the beginning of last year, including seven-figure contributions from the kind of billionaire financiers Mr. Sanders delights in lampooning on the campaign trail. A research and rapid-response super PAC, Correct the Record, founded by the Clinton ally David Brock and funded by wealthy liberals, has also taken swipes at Mr. Sanders in recent days over his record on gun control.\n\nPriorities USA has continued to husband most of its money for later in the campaign, however, in anticipation of a major general election battle with Mrs. Clinton as the nominee. Several other liberal groups have spent money on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, including Planned Parenthood’s political arm and the League of Conservation Voters. But those expenditures totaled only $847,000, according to spending reported to the elections commission through Monday, less than the amount spent by the nurses’ super PAC, National Nurses United for Patient Protection.\n\nMs. DeMoro, the nurses’ union official, scoffed at any comparison between the two efforts, one by nurses, the other by a political operative.\n\n“This is almost a morality play,” Ms. DeMoro said. “It’s Clinton’s David Brock versus Bernie’s nurses.”","gunning_fog_3":"9.2","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"61.67","index_4":"118","title_4":"2nd former Mexican president unloads on Donald Trump","url_4":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/6fZtc76vZuA/2nd-former-mexican-president-unloads-on-donald-trump.html","candidate_4":"Donald Trump","org_4":"Fox News","top_topic_4":"Immigration","body_4":"MEXICO CITY –  Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday joined his predecessor in office in unloading on Donald Trump, calling the Republican front-runner's campaign racist and saying his discourse on immigration is fueling anti-American sentiment around the world.\nCalderon, a conservative who was president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, even said he thought Trump was trying to exploit the same social feelings and resentments as did Adolf Hitler.\n\"I think his logic of exalting white supremacy isn't even acting against immigration — Donald Trump is the descendant of migrants — it is acting and speaking against immigrants who have a different skin color than him, which is frankly racist and is a bit like the exploitation of sensitive fibers that Hitler did in his day,\" Calderon told reporters after a meeting of the National Action Party, or PAN, in Mexico City.\nCalderon's comments parallel those made earlier by former President Vicente Fox, who preceded Calderon in office and also belonged to the PAN party.\nIn interviews with Univision and Mexican media, Fox called Trump \"crazy,\" a \"false prophet\" and an embarrassment to his party.

Here I’ll draw on an argument between two liberals, ruminating on how the possibility of a Trump nomination should be regarded on the left. On the one hand, Jonathan Chait has made the case that his fellow liberals should cheer Trump on, not only because he’s unlikely to win a general election but also because it wouldn’t be so bad if he did, since he’d be a much more ideologically-unsettled figure than a President Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, and thus more likely to cut deals with Democrats and generally govern from some kind of center. As a hopeful example, he invokes as a Trumpian forerunner Arnold Schwarzenegger, another misogynist celebrity demagogue who ended up as “a highly effective governor” because all he cared about was his popularity, which made him much more willing to work across party lines.\n\nThen for a counterpoint, there’s Ezra Klein, who concedes that we can’t know what a Trump White House would mean for public policy, but argues that liberals (and everyone else) should find him “terrifying” nonetheless, for reasons that have less to do with the specifics of what he might stand for than with how unbound he is from normal conventions and restraints:\n\nTrump’s other gift … is his complete lack of shame. It’s easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they’re exposed as liars, when they’re seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.\n\nTrump doesn’t. He has the reality television star’s ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won’t, to say what others can’t, to do what others wouldn’t.\n\nTrump lives by the reality television trope that he’s not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they’re not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. “I’m not here to make friends” is another way of saying, “I’m not bound by the social conventions of normal people.” The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.\n\nThis, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field … But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do — or what he wouldn’t do.\n\nThis seems, unfortunately, mostly right. I’m not “terrified” of Trump because fool that I am, I still don’t think he’ll be the Republican nominee. But I don’t think anyone, right or left, should feel sanguine about what he represents, or about the prospect of having someone so unrestrained elected to an office that’s increasingly lacking in effective formal restraints upon its powers.\n\nThe Schwarzenegger example does show that a major American state’s government can survive a Trump-like figure at the helm. But first of all the idea that Arnie was “highly effective” because he did some things that liberals like is a little strange, since he spent his second term presiding ineffectually over a period of constant, gridlocked budget crises and left office with approval ratings in the 20s. (At best you could argue that he was a merciful failure as a strongman.) And second, when it comes to celebrity-infused demagoguery Schwarzenegger was Trump-like but also Trump-lite: For all his coarseness he did tone things down, not up, during his campaign and subsequent administration, trying to play at least somewhat by normal political rules. Yes, there was talk of “girlie men” and racially-charged remarks, and he delighted in striking action-hero poses. But there was nothing quite like Trump’s constant doubling down on norm-breaching and taboo-busting, no Schwarzeneggerian equivalent of the promises to ban Muslims and torture the relatives of terrorists …\n\n… and even if there had been, the governorship of California is just not that powerful an office, whereas the presidency of the United States has been growing more powerful and less constrained by traditional norms with every passing administration. One need not pass judgment on individual presidents and their policies to recognize this trend, and to expect it to continue regardless of which party wins in 2016. In that context, a successful man-on-horseback candidacy, in which a president is elected on whose selling point is that he refuses to bow to convention or restraint, is precisely the kind of thing that could expose some of the underlying perils inherent in our system, and accelerate America’s march toward either Caesarism or crisis.\n\nThe best case scenario — for the republic, if not for public policy — might be that such a president would simply be a failure, an instant John Tyler-esque lame duck with both parties maneuvering to replace him from day one; the worst case is some sort of constitutional crisis, except with a president far less likely than Richard Nixon to bow to the Beltway consensus and give way.\n\nNow probably a Trump presidency would fall somewhere in between those two possibilities; probably he really would be a little less over-the-top in office than he has been on the trail. (In order to win a general election, clearly, he would need to adapt and become, well, a little more politically correct.) But a Trumpian four years would almost certainly involve a significant degradation of the unwritten restraints on presidential conduct, an acceleration of royalist tendencies that may be built into our system but still deserve to be slowed down, and a blurring of reality-TV and political culture that takes us several leagues further along the road to President Camacho. I don’t think that the nebulous possibility of dealmaking should tempt liberals to welcome this kind of experiment; I don’t think the hope of a more working-class-friendly G.O.P. should tempt conservative reformers to learn to love it either. And the fact that recent presidents have already pushed the envelope in all kinds of troubling ways is not a “what’s the big deal” case for accepting Trumpism: Noting that George W. Bush approved waterboarding (while insisting that we don’t torture) or that Barack Obama launched wars without congressional approval (while denying they were real wars) is not a case for electing a candidate who’s gleeful in his promises to torture with abandon and rob other countries of their oil; rather, it’s a warning of what the office does to men who are restrained by norms and rules and the tribute that executive vice still has to pay to constitutional virtue.\n\nThe only case for actively embracing a figure like Trump, it seems to me, is if he were the only candidate willing to address a crisis or challenge that’s so existentially or absolutely important that it’s worth gambling our ragged republican norms to see it successfully resolved. This is the vibe I get from certain immigration restrictionists, from the Ann Coulter-Mickey Kaus cohort to, well, more insalubrious voices on the web. And frankly if America were in Germany’s position right now, and voting Trump was the only alternative to admitting 500,000-1,000,000 Middle Eastern migrants every year in perpetuity and/or tearing the country’s politics apart, I might find the case for the Donald a little more persuasive. But one can oppose Rubio-Schumer and other “comprehensive” immigration reforms (and I’ve written a lot of words in opposition) and still recognize 1) that the problems with America’s immigration policy do not pose an existential threat to the republic  and 2) that Trump is about as likely to be a reliable immigration hawk in office as he is to be a reliable anything, which is to say not very. (He’ll boost deportations and build a wall in the first year, sure — but as he’s already promised, it’ll have the biggest, most luxurious door you’ve ever seen.)\n\nWhich is why it’s one thing for people dissatisfied with Conservatism, Inc. and the G.O.P. to be anti-anti-Trump — as I’ve been in the past, and will be again if he fades — and urge the party to take his challenge seriously and co-opt some of his gestures and ideas. But it’s quite another to be actively pro-Trump: Welcoming a would-be strongman because he’s pandering to you on a single issue rarely turns out well, and a vote for the rhinoceros is usually just a good way to end up gored.","gunning_fog_5":"15.2","flesch_5":"16.2","readability_5":"37.98","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton Is Fundamentally Honest and Trustworthy","gold_url":"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/hillary-clinton-fundamentally-honest-and-trustworthy","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"Mother Jones","gold_body":"As we all know, millennials don't care much for Hillary Clinton. That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}},{"id":1952934254,"created_at":"2016-04-08T02:37:58+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T02:23:34+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"IN","city":"Evansville","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915122,"worker_id":1944668,"trust":0.125,"worker_trust":0.9125,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"-1","q1":"-1","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"1","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"0","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"64","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"ted_cruz"},"unit_data":{"nil":"16","index_1":"116","title_1":"After GOP establishment 'froze' on Trump, Democrats ready battle plans","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-democrats-election-2016/index.html","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Columbus, Ohio (CNN) As Donald Trump seems poised for a huge night Tuesday, Democrats see his stunning ascent and controversial, celebrity-driven business empire as a golden opportunity. \n\"Those bankruptcies screwed a lot of people -- and not just hedge fund yuppies,\" said a top strategist aligned with a pro-Clinton super PAC. \"His idea of 'winning' has involved a lot of bad behavior -- and the victims are exactly the profile of Trump voters: blue-collar whites.\"\nFor months, key campaign operatives inside the Republican Party establishment were supremely confident that Trump would implode long before this moment. Instead, the GOP is now facing an existential crisis not seen in more than a generation as much of the party leadership and many of its top figures are in open revolt against Trump's candidacy heading into Super Tuesday.\nThe potential liabilities lurking in Trump's background are hardly a secret. The real estate magnate's occasional business failings and colorful personal life have filled the pages of New York tabloids for decades.\nStoring its ammunition for the general election, one pro-Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has taken a few jabs at Trump, choosing instead to portray the businessman as a reflection of the Republican Party.\n\"Trump is no fluke. Nor is he hijacking the Republican Party or the conservative movement,\" wrote Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky in an email to reporters. \"He is, rather, the party's creation, its Frankenstein monster.\"\nA Trump rival, Marco Rubio, has only recently decided to tap that treasure trove of opposition research. That offensive, however, only began in earnest at last week's Republican debate as Rubio mocked Trump's inheritance and legal troubles facing the real estate academy launched by his the tycoon's vast organization.\nThe Democrats' looming business boogeyman assault on Trump is nearly identical to the attack leveled at the last GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, whose financial firm Bain Capital was savaged by pro-Obama super PACs over its practice of downsizing manufacturers for profit.\nInside the pro-Clinton super PAC-world, the Republican establishment's miscalculation is viewed as a tactical error of epic proportions.\n\"Amazing. They just froze,\" the PAC aligned strategist said, requesting anonymity.\nNo candidacy better illustrates GOP's painful lesson, in the minds of several top GOP advisers, than that of Jeb Bush. \nAs Trump delighted in pointing out at every one of his rallies, the former Florida governor and his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, both amassed a war chest capable of annihilating any potential rival. But instead of directing that arsenal at Trump, Bush and his allies chose to target fellow establishment figures, especially Rubio.\n\"The civilized world raised an army and entrusted it to Right to Rise PAC,\" said Stuart Stevens, Romney's former campaign manager. \"Instead of fighting barbarians, they decided to try and kill everybody who agrees with them. Crazy. Just crazy.\"\n\"The Right to Rise thing is historically bad,\" he added.\nStevens, a key figure in Romney's political world, has brutally attacked the GOP front-runner on Twitter. \n\"It's becoming obvious that supporting or not supporting (Trump) isn't a political choice. It's a moral choice. The man is evil,\" he said.\nTrump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, brushed off the party's concerns about his candidate. \n\"I worry about everything,\" Lewandowski quipped. \nRubio's calculated, yet harsh attack on Trump came only hours after Romney challenged the billionaire businessman to release his tax returns. Trump responded with a slew of insults aimed at Romney on Friday, remarking that the former Massachusetts governor had no hopes of winning in 2012 because he \"walked like a duck.\"\nOn Monday, Romney tweeted that Trump's inability to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan on CNN's \"State of the Union\" as disqualifying.\nAs for Bush, he was hardly the only candidate to engage in Trump denial. \nTed Cruz, who has also raised a vast fortune in contributions, studiously avoided contact with the GOP front-runner for much of 2015, hopeful that Trump would self-destruct and releasing his angry anti-establishment electorate in search of safe harbor. \nThe famously tough-talking Chris Christie grumbled to reporters time and again that he would not attack Trump, only doing so before dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor is now arguably Trump's most senior establishment supporter.\nAlso underestimated was the anger brewing on the margins of the American economic recovery. Working-class voters who are simply too conservative to support a self-declared democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders are flocking to Trump's message that illegal immigration and bad trade deals are decimating the heartland.\nTrump has dubbed these boisterous followers, who stuff themselves into arenas and auditoriums, the \"noisy majority.\" \nAnd while they may actually have the energy and enthusiasm to sweep Trump and the Republican Party back into the White House, many in the GOP hierarchy are predicting easy pickings for Democrats and associated super PACs come November.\nAnother top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, sees the rise of Trump as a logical extension of the tea party movement, which is highly capable of putting conservatives in Congress, but is a turnoff to more moderate, suburban voters in presidential elections. \n\"This is the natural consequence of 2009 and 2010,\" said the strategist. \"We co-opted a movement made up largely of the least informed voters. We got significant short-term political gain, but in the process empowered a group that has little interest in reason.\"\n\"We reap what we sow,\" the strategist said.\nTrump is equally disdainful of his Republican critics. The celebrity magnate, who authored \"The Art of the Deal,\" routinely lambastes GOP leaders in Congress over the recent budget deal with the White House. Trump insists he will broker better agreements as president by simply walking away from the negotiating table when necessary.\nAt times, Trump has sought to ease tensions within the Republican Party over his superheated rhetoric on immigration. He often highlights his standing in the polls with Latino voters and praises the Hispanic employees who work at his hotels.\nBut senior GOP advisers privately worry the damage is done.\n\"The bubble will crash at some point, but I fear we will be tatters by the time it does,\" one top Republican congressional aide said.","gunning_fog_1":"10.0","flesch_1":"12.3","readability_1":"42.72","index_2":"66","title_2":"Clinton Super PAC Ramps Up Spending Ahead of Next Round of Primaries","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/clinton-super-pac-ramps-up-spending-ahead-of-next-round-of-primaries/","candidate_2":"Hillary Clinton","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"The pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC is ramping up its spending ahead of a series of nominating contests, following Mrs. Clinton’s loss in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, is running a $500,000 radio ad campaign promoting Mrs. Clinton in South Carolina, where Democrats vote Feb. 27. The ad casts Mrs. Clinton as best equipped to continue President Barack Obama‘s policies and praises her experience and record.\nIt is also launching a $4.5 million radio, digital and mail ad campaign to boost early turnout by black, Latino and female voters in states with March primaries. The effort will be implemented together with the environmental group League of Conservation Voters and Emily’s List, which promotes female pro-choice candidates.\nThe burst in spending by Priorities, which had originally intended to save its funds for the general election, suggests Clinton allies are concerned about the tougher-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Following her loss by more than 20 points in New Hampshire and her razor-thin win in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton needs victories in Nevada and South Carolina.\nPriorities raised $41 million in 2015, and another $10 million through January. It previously spent about $400,000 boosting Mrs. Clinton in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early-nominating states. It has not spent any money attacking Mr. Sanders.\nPriorities officials said they expect the early voting campaign to target all March states, and said it will focus on states with in-person early voting such as Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina.\nGuy Cecil, the super PAC’s chief strategist, said he expects the campaign to boost Mrs. Clinton in both the general and the primary elections. “We have always seen as our primary responsibility the general election, making sure that Hillary wins, and we have always thought we would assess where we were, to make sure we were doing everything possible to build a long-term coalition for her campaign,” he said in a written statement.\nThe super PAC spending has already drawn criticism from Mr. Sanders. In a message to supporters on Friday, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said, “It is truly unfortunate that the largest pro-Clinton super PAC has decided to infect the Democratic primary process with its haul of Wall Street cash.”\nMr. Sanders also has received at least $1.5 million in backing from a super PAC run by the nurses union, filings with the Federal Election Commission show.","gunning_fog_2":"8.4","flesch_2":"8.4","readability_2":"63.7","index_3":"15","title_3":"Bernie Sanders Is Democrats’ Top Beneficiary of Outside Spending, Like it or Not","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-is-democrats-top-beneficiary-of-outside-spending-like-it-or-not.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"DES MOINES — As he swung through Iowa this week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont rarely passed up a chance to bash the rising tide of money in politics, a system he said on Tuesday was “corrupt and undermining American democracy.”\n\nAt many of these stops, he was accompanied by members of National Nurses United, a seven-year-old union, fanning out from a bright-red bus in matching red scrubs to corral potential Sanders votes.\n\nBut the union is not just busing nurses into Iowa. The union’s “super PAC” has spent close to $1 million on ads and other support for Mr. Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate who has inspired liberal voters with his calls to eradicate such outside groups. In fact, more super PAC money has been spent so far in express support of Mr. Sanders than for either of his Democratic rivals, including Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\n“I do appreciate the irony,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United. “All things being equal, we would rather not be doing this. On the other hand, we want to see Bernie as president.”\n\nMr. Sander’s unlikely rise to super PAC pre-eminence is, in part, the story of an unusual alignment of strategies by different outside groups, including Republican ones eager to bloody Mrs. Clinton and lift Mr. Sanders, whom conservatives believe will be easier to defeat in a general election. While the nurses’ super PAC is the biggest left-leaning outside spender in the Democratic primary, conservative organizations have also spent at least $4.3 million attacking Mrs. Clinton in recent months.\n\nOne recent online ad from the Republican super PAC American Crossroads has assailed Mrs. Clinton for her Wall Street speaking fees — echoing an argument Mr. Sanders often makes against her. Another conservative group, Ending Spending, bankrolled by the Wyoming billionaire Joe Ricketts, has begun a $600,000 campaign in Iowa highlighting Mr. Sanders’s promises to raise taxes on the rich and provide free public college tuition, calling him “too liberal for Iowa.” But the ad’s language and imagery, including a contented-looking superrich couple hugging in front of a mansion and expensive cars, has led some Democrats to believe it is actually meant to bolster Mr. Sanders.\n\nBut the super PAC spending by the nurses union also underscores an aspect of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that Mr. Sanders rarely dwells on in his campaign speeches attacking the ruling. The same decision that gave corporations the ability to “buy and purchase the United States government” — as Mr. Sanders put it during a visit to Grinnell College on Monday — bestowed the same rights on labor unions, freeing them to spend unlimited money from their treasuries on election advertising.\n\nWhile the vast majority of super PAC money still comes from wealthy individuals, union cash — pooled from the dues and contributions of members — has become a critical source of money for outside groups on the left. In 2012 and 2014, unions contributed more than $200 million to super PACs. More than half of it went to union-controlled groups that spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising, mailers, and other “independent expenditures.” So far in 2016, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, seven of the top 20 organizational contributors to super PACs were unions or their affiliates, rather than corporations.\n\n“When you have hundreds of thousands or millions of dues-paying members, you can wield a significant amount of influence,” said Robert McGuire, an investigator at the center. “It’s the flip side of a lot of other spending we’re seeing this days.”\n\nNo union has spent as much money in the Democratic primary as National Nurses United, which was born out of a 2009 merger of three smaller unions and has unapologetically embraced liberal politics and movement-building. In 2011, union nurses provided health care at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Lower Manhattan, and the organization has lobbied forcefully for single-payer health care and a financial transaction tax.\n\nWhen most large labor organizations backed Mrs. Clinton, the nurses were among a handful to support Mr. Sanders, among them the Communications Workers of America and the postal workers’ union. They are guided, the nurses’ leaders say, by the principle that taking care of patients means taking care of the country, too.\n\n“This sick government we have right now is killing our democracy,” said Jean Ross, a Minnesota nurse now serving as of the group’s three co-presidents, at a Sanders event in Des Moines on Tuesday. The union’s bus stood outside a steelworkers union hall, where the red scrubs worn by the nurses speckled a room full of Carhartt jackets and denim. At any given time, as many as 30 nurses from around the country are on the campaign trail helping Mr. Sanders, rotating in on vacation days and weekends.\n\n“We have a bus, he has a bus,” Ms. Ross said gaily. “Nurses get on, nurses get off.”\n\nThe group’s campaigning advocacy for Mr. Sanders has drawn charges of hypocrisy from Mrs. Clinton’s supporters. While Mr. Sanders frequently declares that he has no super PAC of his own, he has not publicly called on the nurses to refrain from their efforts on his behalf. He has welcomed their help, thanking the nurses by name in campaign speeches and referring to the union in one recent appearance as a “one of the sponsors” of his campaign.\n\n“This is one of the prime examples of Senator Sanders saying one thing and doing another,” said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. “For months he had criticized super PACs and pledged to shun them in his campaign, but all along he has benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars in independent expenditures from one of those very organizations.”\n\nMr. Sanders insists there is no contradiction.\n\n“The difference is a pretty simple difference,” Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday. “Hillary Clinton goes out raising money for her own super PAC. I don’t have a super PAC, and in the best of all possible worlds, which I hope to bring about, we will get rid of super PACs, we will overturn Citizens United.”\n\nMrs. Clinton has indeed helped raise money for a super PAC: Priorities USA Action, a group originally formed to help re-elect President Obama and now run by a former Clinton campaign aide. The group has raised more than $40 million since the beginning of last year, including seven-figure contributions from the kind of billionaire financiers Mr. Sanders delights in lampooning on the campaign trail. A research and rapid-response super PAC, Correct the Record, founded by the Clinton ally David Brock and funded by wealthy liberals, has also taken swipes at Mr. Sanders in recent days over his record on gun control.\n\nPriorities USA has continued to husband most of its money for later in the campaign, however, in anticipation of a major general election battle with Mrs. Clinton as the nominee. Several other liberal groups have spent money on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, including Planned Parenthood’s political arm and the League of Conservation Voters. But those expenditures totaled only $847,000, according to spending reported to the elections commission through Monday, less than the amount spent by the nurses’ super PAC, National Nurses United for Patient Protection.\n\nMs. DeMoro, the nurses’ union official, scoffed at any comparison between the two efforts, one by nurses, the other by a political operative.\n\n“This is almost a morality play,” Ms. DeMoro said. “It’s Clinton’s David Brock versus Bernie’s nurses.”","gunning_fog_3":"9.2","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"61.67","index_4":"118","title_4":"2nd former Mexican president unloads on Donald Trump","url_4":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/6fZtc76vZuA/2nd-former-mexican-president-unloads-on-donald-trump.html","candidate_4":"Donald Trump","org_4":"Fox News","top_topic_4":"Immigration","body_4":"MEXICO CITY –  Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday joined his predecessor in office in unloading on Donald Trump, calling the Republican front-runner's campaign racist and saying his discourse on immigration is fueling anti-American sentiment around the world.\nCalderon, a conservative who was president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, even said he thought Trump was trying to exploit the same social feelings and resentments as did Adolf Hitler.\n\"I think his logic of exalting white supremacy isn't even acting against immigration — Donald Trump is the descendant of migrants — it is acting and speaking against immigrants who have a different skin color than him, which is frankly racist and is a bit like the exploitation of sensitive fibers that Hitler did in his day,\" Calderon told reporters after a meeting of the National Action Party, or PAN, in Mexico City.\nCalderon's comments parallel those made earlier by former President Vicente Fox, who preceded Calderon in office and also belonged to the PAN party.\nIn interviews with Univision and Mexican media, Fox called Trump \"crazy,\" a \"false prophet\" and an embarrassment to his party.

Here I’ll draw on an argument between two liberals, ruminating on how the possibility of a Trump nomination should be regarded on the left. On the one hand, Jonathan Chait has made the case that his fellow liberals should cheer Trump on, not only because he’s unlikely to win a general election but also because it wouldn’t be so bad if he did, since he’d be a much more ideologically-unsettled figure than a President Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, and thus more likely to cut deals with Democrats and generally govern from some kind of center. As a hopeful example, he invokes as a Trumpian forerunner Arnold Schwarzenegger, another misogynist celebrity demagogue who ended up as “a highly effective governor” because all he cared about was his popularity, which made him much more willing to work across party lines.\n\nThen for a counterpoint, there’s Ezra Klein, who concedes that we can’t know what a Trump White House would mean for public policy, but argues that liberals (and everyone else) should find him “terrifying” nonetheless, for reasons that have less to do with the specifics of what he might stand for than with how unbound he is from normal conventions and restraints:\n\nTrump’s other gift … is his complete lack of shame. It’s easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they’re exposed as liars, when they’re seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.\n\nTrump doesn’t. He has the reality television star’s ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won’t, to say what others can’t, to do what others wouldn’t.\n\nTrump lives by the reality television trope that he’s not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they’re not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. “I’m not here to make friends” is another way of saying, “I’m not bound by the social conventions of normal people.” The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.\n\nThis, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field … But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do — or what he wouldn’t do.\n\nThis seems, unfortunately, mostly right. I’m not “terrified” of Trump because fool that I am, I still don’t think he’ll be the Republican nominee. But I don’t think anyone, right or left, should feel sanguine about what he represents, or about the prospect of having someone so unrestrained elected to an office that’s increasingly lacking in effective formal restraints upon its powers.\n\nThe Schwarzenegger example does show that a major American state’s government can survive a Trump-like figure at the helm. But first of all the idea that Arnie was “highly effective” because he did some things that liberals like is a little strange, since he spent his second term presiding ineffectually over a period of constant, gridlocked budget crises and left office with approval ratings in the 20s. (At best you could argue that he was a merciful failure as a strongman.) And second, when it comes to celebrity-infused demagoguery Schwarzenegger was Trump-like but also Trump-lite: For all his coarseness he did tone things down, not up, during his campaign and subsequent administration, trying to play at least somewhat by normal political rules. Yes, there was talk of “girlie men” and racially-charged remarks, and he delighted in striking action-hero poses. But there was nothing quite like Trump’s constant doubling down on norm-breaching and taboo-busting, no Schwarzeneggerian equivalent of the promises to ban Muslims and torture the relatives of terrorists …\n\n… and even if there had been, the governorship of California is just not that powerful an office, whereas the presidency of the United States has been growing more powerful and less constrained by traditional norms with every passing administration. One need not pass judgment on individual presidents and their policies to recognize this trend, and to expect it to continue regardless of which party wins in 2016. In that context, a successful man-on-horseback candidacy, in which a president is elected on whose selling point is that he refuses to bow to convention or restraint, is precisely the kind of thing that could expose some of the underlying perils inherent in our system, and accelerate America’s march toward either Caesarism or crisis.\n\nThe best case scenario — for the republic, if not for public policy — might be that such a president would simply be a failure, an instant John Tyler-esque lame duck with both parties maneuvering to replace him from day one; the worst case is some sort of constitutional crisis, except with a president far less likely than Richard Nixon to bow to the Beltway consensus and give way.\n\nNow probably a Trump presidency would fall somewhere in between those two possibilities; probably he really would be a little less over-the-top in office than he has been on the trail. (In order to win a general election, clearly, he would need to adapt and become, well, a little more politically correct.) But a Trumpian four years would almost certainly involve a significant degradation of the unwritten restraints on presidential conduct, an acceleration of royalist tendencies that may be built into our system but still deserve to be slowed down, and a blurring of reality-TV and political culture that takes us several leagues further along the road to President Camacho. I don’t think that the nebulous possibility of dealmaking should tempt liberals to welcome this kind of experiment; I don’t think the hope of a more working-class-friendly G.O.P. should tempt conservative reformers to learn to love it either. And the fact that recent presidents have already pushed the envelope in all kinds of troubling ways is not a “what’s the big deal” case for accepting Trumpism: Noting that George W. Bush approved waterboarding (while insisting that we don’t torture) or that Barack Obama launched wars without congressional approval (while denying they were real wars) is not a case for electing a candidate who’s gleeful in his promises to torture with abandon and rob other countries of their oil; rather, it’s a warning of what the office does to men who are restrained by norms and rules and the tribute that executive vice still has to pay to constitutional virtue.\n\nThe only case for actively embracing a figure like Trump, it seems to me, is if he were the only candidate willing to address a crisis or challenge that’s so existentially or absolutely important that it’s worth gambling our ragged republican norms to see it successfully resolved. This is the vibe I get from certain immigration restrictionists, from the Ann Coulter-Mickey Kaus cohort to, well, more insalubrious voices on the web. And frankly if America were in Germany’s position right now, and voting Trump was the only alternative to admitting 500,000-1,000,000 Middle Eastern migrants every year in perpetuity and/or tearing the country’s politics apart, I might find the case for the Donald a little more persuasive. But one can oppose Rubio-Schumer and other “comprehensive” immigration reforms (and I’ve written a lot of words in opposition) and still recognize 1) that the problems with America’s immigration policy do not pose an existential threat to the republic  and 2) that Trump is about as likely to be a reliable immigration hawk in office as he is to be a reliable anything, which is to say not very. (He’ll boost deportations and build a wall in the first year, sure — but as he’s already promised, it’ll have the biggest, most luxurious door you’ve ever seen.)\n\nWhich is why it’s one thing for people dissatisfied with Conservatism, Inc. and the G.O.P. to be anti-anti-Trump — as I’ve been in the past, and will be again if he fades — and urge the party to take his challenge seriously and co-opt some of his gestures and ideas. But it’s quite another to be actively pro-Trump: Welcoming a would-be strongman because he’s pandering to you on a single issue rarely turns out well, and a vote for the rhinoceros is usually just a good way to end up gored.","gunning_fog_5":"15.2","flesch_5":"16.2","readability_5":"37.98","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton Is Fundamentally Honest and Trustworthy","gold_url":"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/hillary-clinton-fundamentally-honest-and-trustworthy","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"Mother Jones","gold_body":"As we all know, millennials don't care much for Hillary Clinton. That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}},{"id":1952939618,"created_at":"2016-04-08T02:48:01+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T02:32:25+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"San Jose","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915122,"worker_id":30513549,"trust":0.5625,"worker_trust":0.8825,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"-1","q2":"2","q3":"0","q4":"2","q5":"0","q6":"2","q7":"-1","q8":"2","q9":"0","q10":"2","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"ted_cruz"},"unit_data":{"nil":"16","index_1":"116","title_1":"After GOP establishment 'froze' on Trump, Democrats ready battle plans","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-democrats-election-2016/index.html","candidate_1":"Donald Trump","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Columbus, Ohio (CNN) As Donald Trump seems poised for a huge night Tuesday, Democrats see his stunning ascent and controversial, celebrity-driven business empire as a golden opportunity. \n\"Those bankruptcies screwed a lot of people -- and not just hedge fund yuppies,\" said a top strategist aligned with a pro-Clinton super PAC. \"His idea of 'winning' has involved a lot of bad behavior -- and the victims are exactly the profile of Trump voters: blue-collar whites.\"\nFor months, key campaign operatives inside the Republican Party establishment were supremely confident that Trump would implode long before this moment. Instead, the GOP is now facing an existential crisis not seen in more than a generation as much of the party leadership and many of its top figures are in open revolt against Trump's candidacy heading into Super Tuesday.\nThe potential liabilities lurking in Trump's background are hardly a secret. The real estate magnate's occasional business failings and colorful personal life have filled the pages of New York tabloids for decades.\nStoring its ammunition for the general election, one pro-Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has taken a few jabs at Trump, choosing instead to portray the businessman as a reflection of the Republican Party.\n\"Trump is no fluke. Nor is he hijacking the Republican Party or the conservative movement,\" wrote Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky in an email to reporters. \"He is, rather, the party's creation, its Frankenstein monster.\"\nA Trump rival, Marco Rubio, has only recently decided to tap that treasure trove of opposition research. That offensive, however, only began in earnest at last week's Republican debate as Rubio mocked Trump's inheritance and legal troubles facing the real estate academy launched by his the tycoon's vast organization.\nThe Democrats' looming business boogeyman assault on Trump is nearly identical to the attack leveled at the last GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, whose financial firm Bain Capital was savaged by pro-Obama super PACs over its practice of downsizing manufacturers for profit.\nInside the pro-Clinton super PAC-world, the Republican establishment's miscalculation is viewed as a tactical error of epic proportions.\n\"Amazing. They just froze,\" the PAC aligned strategist said, requesting anonymity.\nNo candidacy better illustrates GOP's painful lesson, in the minds of several top GOP advisers, than that of Jeb Bush. \nAs Trump delighted in pointing out at every one of his rallies, the former Florida governor and his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, both amassed a war chest capable of annihilating any potential rival. But instead of directing that arsenal at Trump, Bush and his allies chose to target fellow establishment figures, especially Rubio.\n\"The civilized world raised an army and entrusted it to Right to Rise PAC,\" said Stuart Stevens, Romney's former campaign manager. \"Instead of fighting barbarians, they decided to try and kill everybody who agrees with them. Crazy. Just crazy.\"\n\"The Right to Rise thing is historically bad,\" he added.\nStevens, a key figure in Romney's political world, has brutally attacked the GOP front-runner on Twitter. \n\"It's becoming obvious that supporting or not supporting (Trump) isn't a political choice. It's a moral choice. The man is evil,\" he said.\nTrump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, brushed off the party's concerns about his candidate. \n\"I worry about everything,\" Lewandowski quipped. \nRubio's calculated, yet harsh attack on Trump came only hours after Romney challenged the billionaire businessman to release his tax returns. Trump responded with a slew of insults aimed at Romney on Friday, remarking that the former Massachusetts governor had no hopes of winning in 2012 because he \"walked like a duck.\"\nOn Monday, Romney tweeted that Trump's inability to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan on CNN's \"State of the Union\" as disqualifying.\nAs for Bush, he was hardly the only candidate to engage in Trump denial. \nTed Cruz, who has also raised a vast fortune in contributions, studiously avoided contact with the GOP front-runner for much of 2015, hopeful that Trump would self-destruct and releasing his angry anti-establishment electorate in search of safe harbor. \nThe famously tough-talking Chris Christie grumbled to reporters time and again that he would not attack Trump, only doing so before dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor is now arguably Trump's most senior establishment supporter.\nAlso underestimated was the anger brewing on the margins of the American economic recovery. Working-class voters who are simply too conservative to support a self-declared democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders are flocking to Trump's message that illegal immigration and bad trade deals are decimating the heartland.\nTrump has dubbed these boisterous followers, who stuff themselves into arenas and auditoriums, the \"noisy majority.\" \nAnd while they may actually have the energy and enthusiasm to sweep Trump and the Republican Party back into the White House, many in the GOP hierarchy are predicting easy pickings for Democrats and associated super PACs come November.\nAnother top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, sees the rise of Trump as a logical extension of the tea party movement, which is highly capable of putting conservatives in Congress, but is a turnoff to more moderate, suburban voters in presidential elections. \n\"This is the natural consequence of 2009 and 2010,\" said the strategist. \"We co-opted a movement made up largely of the least informed voters. We got significant short-term political gain, but in the process empowered a group that has little interest in reason.\"\n\"We reap what we sow,\" the strategist said.\nTrump is equally disdainful of his Republican critics. The celebrity magnate, who authored \"The Art of the Deal,\" routinely lambastes GOP leaders in Congress over the recent budget deal with the White House. Trump insists he will broker better agreements as president by simply walking away from the negotiating table when necessary.\nAt times, Trump has sought to ease tensions within the Republican Party over his superheated rhetoric on immigration. He often highlights his standing in the polls with Latino voters and praises the Hispanic employees who work at his hotels.\nBut senior GOP advisers privately worry the damage is done.\n\"The bubble will crash at some point, but I fear we will be tatters by the time it does,\" one top Republican congressional aide said.","gunning_fog_1":"10.0","flesch_1":"12.3","readability_1":"42.72","index_2":"66","title_2":"Clinton Super PAC Ramps Up Spending Ahead of Next Round of Primaries","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/clinton-super-pac-ramps-up-spending-ahead-of-next-round-of-primaries/","candidate_2":"Hillary Clinton","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"The pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC is ramping up its spending ahead of a series of nominating contests, following Mrs. Clinton’s loss in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary.\nThe super PAC, Priorities USA Action, is running a $500,000 radio ad campaign promoting Mrs. Clinton in South Carolina, where Democrats vote Feb. 27. The ad casts Mrs. Clinton as best equipped to continue President Barack Obama‘s policies and praises her experience and record.\nIt is also launching a $4.5 million radio, digital and mail ad campaign to boost early turnout by black, Latino and female voters in states with March primaries. The effort will be implemented together with the environmental group League of Conservation Voters and Emily’s List, which promotes female pro-choice candidates.\nThe burst in spending by Priorities, which had originally intended to save its funds for the general election, suggests Clinton allies are concerned about the tougher-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Following her loss by more than 20 points in New Hampshire and her razor-thin win in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton needs victories in Nevada and South Carolina.\nPriorities raised $41 million in 2015, and another $10 million through January. It previously spent about $400,000 boosting Mrs. Clinton in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early-nominating states. It has not spent any money attacking Mr. Sanders.\nPriorities officials said they expect the early voting campaign to target all March states, and said it will focus on states with in-person early voting such as Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina.\nGuy Cecil, the super PAC’s chief strategist, said he expects the campaign to boost Mrs. Clinton in both the general and the primary elections. “We have always seen as our primary responsibility the general election, making sure that Hillary wins, and we have always thought we would assess where we were, to make sure we were doing everything possible to build a long-term coalition for her campaign,” he said in a written statement.\nThe super PAC spending has already drawn criticism from Mr. Sanders. In a message to supporters on Friday, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said, “It is truly unfortunate that the largest pro-Clinton super PAC has decided to infect the Democratic primary process with its haul of Wall Street cash.”\nMr. Sanders also has received at least $1.5 million in backing from a super PAC run by the nurses union, filings with the Federal Election Commission show.","gunning_fog_2":"8.4","flesch_2":"8.4","readability_2":"63.7","index_3":"15","title_3":"Bernie Sanders Is Democrats’ Top Beneficiary of Outside Spending, Like it or Not","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-is-democrats-top-beneficiary-of-outside-spending-like-it-or-not.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"DES MOINES — As he swung through Iowa this week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont rarely passed up a chance to bash the rising tide of money in politics, a system he said on Tuesday was “corrupt and undermining American democracy.”\n\nAt many of these stops, he was accompanied by members of National Nurses United, a seven-year-old union, fanning out from a bright-red bus in matching red scrubs to corral potential Sanders votes.\n\nBut the union is not just busing nurses into Iowa. The union’s “super PAC” has spent close to $1 million on ads and other support for Mr. Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate who has inspired liberal voters with his calls to eradicate such outside groups. In fact, more super PAC money has been spent so far in express support of Mr. Sanders than for either of his Democratic rivals, including Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\n“I do appreciate the irony,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United. “All things being equal, we would rather not be doing this. On the other hand, we want to see Bernie as president.”\n\nMr. Sander’s unlikely rise to super PAC pre-eminence is, in part, the story of an unusual alignment of strategies by different outside groups, including Republican ones eager to bloody Mrs. Clinton and lift Mr. Sanders, whom conservatives believe will be easier to defeat in a general election. While the nurses’ super PAC is the biggest left-leaning outside spender in the Democratic primary, conservative organizations have also spent at least $4.3 million attacking Mrs. Clinton in recent months.\n\nOne recent online ad from the Republican super PAC American Crossroads has assailed Mrs. Clinton for her Wall Street speaking fees — echoing an argument Mr. Sanders often makes against her. Another conservative group, Ending Spending, bankrolled by the Wyoming billionaire Joe Ricketts, has begun a $600,000 campaign in Iowa highlighting Mr. Sanders’s promises to raise taxes on the rich and provide free public college tuition, calling him “too liberal for Iowa.” But the ad’s language and imagery, including a contented-looking superrich couple hugging in front of a mansion and expensive cars, has led some Democrats to believe it is actually meant to bolster Mr. Sanders.\n\nBut the super PAC spending by the nurses union also underscores an aspect of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that Mr. Sanders rarely dwells on in his campaign speeches attacking the ruling. The same decision that gave corporations the ability to “buy and purchase the United States government” — as Mr. Sanders put it during a visit to Grinnell College on Monday — bestowed the same rights on labor unions, freeing them to spend unlimited money from their treasuries on election advertising.\n\nWhile the vast majority of super PAC money still comes from wealthy individuals, union cash — pooled from the dues and contributions of members — has become a critical source of money for outside groups on the left. In 2012 and 2014, unions contributed more than $200 million to super PACs. More than half of it went to union-controlled groups that spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising, mailers, and other “independent expenditures.” So far in 2016, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, seven of the top 20 organizational contributors to super PACs were unions or their affiliates, rather than corporations.\n\n“When you have hundreds of thousands or millions of dues-paying members, you can wield a significant amount of influence,” said Robert McGuire, an investigator at the center. “It’s the flip side of a lot of other spending we’re seeing this days.”\n\nNo union has spent as much money in the Democratic primary as National Nurses United, which was born out of a 2009 merger of three smaller unions and has unapologetically embraced liberal politics and movement-building. In 2011, union nurses provided health care at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Lower Manhattan, and the organization has lobbied forcefully for single-payer health care and a financial transaction tax.\n\nWhen most large labor organizations backed Mrs. Clinton, the nurses were among a handful to support Mr. Sanders, among them the Communications Workers of America and the postal workers’ union. They are guided, the nurses’ leaders say, by the principle that taking care of patients means taking care of the country, too.\n\n“This sick government we have right now is killing our democracy,” said Jean Ross, a Minnesota nurse now serving as of the group’s three co-presidents, at a Sanders event in Des Moines on Tuesday. The union’s bus stood outside a steelworkers union hall, where the red scrubs worn by the nurses speckled a room full of Carhartt jackets and denim. At any given time, as many as 30 nurses from around the country are on the campaign trail helping Mr. Sanders, rotating in on vacation days and weekends.\n\n“We have a bus, he has a bus,” Ms. Ross said gaily. “Nurses get on, nurses get off.”\n\nThe group’s campaigning advocacy for Mr. Sanders has drawn charges of hypocrisy from Mrs. Clinton’s supporters. While Mr. Sanders frequently declares that he has no super PAC of his own, he has not publicly called on the nurses to refrain from their efforts on his behalf. He has welcomed their help, thanking the nurses by name in campaign speeches and referring to the union in one recent appearance as a “one of the sponsors” of his campaign.\n\n“This is one of the prime examples of Senator Sanders saying one thing and doing another,” said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. “For months he had criticized super PACs and pledged to shun them in his campaign, but all along he has benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars in independent expenditures from one of those very organizations.”\n\nMr. Sanders insists there is no contradiction.\n\n“The difference is a pretty simple difference,” Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday. “Hillary Clinton goes out raising money for her own super PAC. I don’t have a super PAC, and in the best of all possible worlds, which I hope to bring about, we will get rid of super PACs, we will overturn Citizens United.”\n\nMrs. Clinton has indeed helped raise money for a super PAC: Priorities USA Action, a group originally formed to help re-elect President Obama and now run by a former Clinton campaign aide. The group has raised more than $40 million since the beginning of last year, including seven-figure contributions from the kind of billionaire financiers Mr. Sanders delights in lampooning on the campaign trail. A research and rapid-response super PAC, Correct the Record, founded by the Clinton ally David Brock and funded by wealthy liberals, has also taken swipes at Mr. Sanders in recent days over his record on gun control.\n\nPriorities USA has continued to husband most of its money for later in the campaign, however, in anticipation of a major general election battle with Mrs. Clinton as the nominee. Several other liberal groups have spent money on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, including Planned Parenthood’s political arm and the League of Conservation Voters. But those expenditures totaled only $847,000, according to spending reported to the elections commission through Monday, less than the amount spent by the nurses’ super PAC, National Nurses United for Patient Protection.\n\nMs. DeMoro, the nurses’ union official, scoffed at any comparison between the two efforts, one by nurses, the other by a political operative.\n\n“This is almost a morality play,” Ms. DeMoro said. “It’s Clinton’s David Brock versus Bernie’s nurses.”","gunning_fog_3":"9.2","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"61.67","index_4":"118","title_4":"2nd former Mexican president unloads on Donald Trump","url_4":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/6fZtc76vZuA/2nd-former-mexican-president-unloads-on-donald-trump.html","candidate_4":"Donald Trump","org_4":"Fox News","top_topic_4":"Immigration","body_4":"MEXICO CITY –  Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday joined his predecessor in office in unloading on Donald Trump, calling the Republican front-runner's campaign racist and saying his discourse on immigration is fueling anti-American sentiment around the world.\nCalderon, a conservative who was president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, even said he thought Trump was trying to exploit the same social feelings and resentments as did Adolf Hitler.\n\"I think his logic of exalting white supremacy isn't even acting against immigration — Donald Trump is the descendant of migrants — it is acting and speaking against immigrants who have a different skin color than him, which is frankly racist and is a bit like the exploitation of sensitive fibers that Hitler did in his day,\" Calderon told reporters after a meeting of the National Action Party, or PAN, in Mexico City.\nCalderon's comments parallel those made earlier by former President Vicente Fox, who preceded Calderon in office and also belonged to the PAN party.\nIn interviews with Univision and Mexican media, Fox called Trump \"crazy,\" a \"false prophet\" and an embarrassment to his party.

Here I’ll draw on an argument between two liberals, ruminating on how the possibility of a Trump nomination should be regarded on the left. On the one hand, Jonathan Chait has made the case that his fellow liberals should cheer Trump on, not only because he’s unlikely to win a general election but also because it wouldn’t be so bad if he did, since he’d be a much more ideologically-unsettled figure than a President Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, and thus more likely to cut deals with Democrats and generally govern from some kind of center. As a hopeful example, he invokes as a Trumpian forerunner Arnold Schwarzenegger, another misogynist celebrity demagogue who ended up as “a highly effective governor” because all he cared about was his popularity, which made him much more willing to work across party lines.\n\nThen for a counterpoint, there’s Ezra Klein, who concedes that we can’t know what a Trump White House would mean for public policy, but argues that liberals (and everyone else) should find him “terrifying” nonetheless, for reasons that have less to do with the specifics of what he might stand for than with how unbound he is from normal conventions and restraints:\n\nTrump’s other gift … is his complete lack of shame. It’s easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they’re exposed as liars, when they’re seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.\n\nTrump doesn’t. He has the reality television star’s ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won’t, to say what others can’t, to do what others wouldn’t.\n\nTrump lives by the reality television trope that he’s not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they’re not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. “I’m not here to make friends” is another way of saying, “I’m not bound by the social conventions of normal people.” The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.\n\nThis, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field … But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do — or what he wouldn’t do.\n\nThis seems, unfortunately, mostly right. I’m not “terrified” of Trump because fool that I am, I still don’t think he’ll be the Republican nominee. But I don’t think anyone, right or left, should feel sanguine about what he represents, or about the prospect of having someone so unrestrained elected to an office that’s increasingly lacking in effective formal restraints upon its powers.\n\nThe Schwarzenegger example does show that a major American state’s government can survive a Trump-like figure at the helm. But first of all the idea that Arnie was “highly effective” because he did some things that liberals like is a little strange, since he spent his second term presiding ineffectually over a period of constant, gridlocked budget crises and left office with approval ratings in the 20s. (At best you could argue that he was a merciful failure as a strongman.) And second, when it comes to celebrity-infused demagoguery Schwarzenegger was Trump-like but also Trump-lite: For all his coarseness he did tone things down, not up, during his campaign and subsequent administration, trying to play at least somewhat by normal political rules. Yes, there was talk of “girlie men” and racially-charged remarks, and he delighted in striking action-hero poses. But there was nothing quite like Trump’s constant doubling down on norm-breaching and taboo-busting, no Schwarzeneggerian equivalent of the promises to ban Muslims and torture the relatives of terrorists …\n\n… and even if there had been, the governorship of California is just not that powerful an office, whereas the presidency of the United States has been growing more powerful and less constrained by traditional norms with every passing administration. One need not pass judgment on individual presidents and their policies to recognize this trend, and to expect it to continue regardless of which party wins in 2016. In that context, a successful man-on-horseback candidacy, in which a president is elected on whose selling point is that he refuses to bow to convention or restraint, is precisely the kind of thing that could expose some of the underlying perils inherent in our system, and accelerate America’s march toward either Caesarism or crisis.\n\nThe best case scenario — for the republic, if not for public policy — might be that such a president would simply be a failure, an instant John Tyler-esque lame duck with both parties maneuvering to replace him from day one; the worst case is some sort of constitutional crisis, except with a president far less likely than Richard Nixon to bow to the Beltway consensus and give way.\n\nNow probably a Trump presidency would fall somewhere in between those two possibilities; probably he really would be a little less over-the-top in office than he has been on the trail. (In order to win a general election, clearly, he would need to adapt and become, well, a little more politically correct.) But a Trumpian four years would almost certainly involve a significant degradation of the unwritten restraints on presidential conduct, an acceleration of royalist tendencies that may be built into our system but still deserve to be slowed down, and a blurring of reality-TV and political culture that takes us several leagues further along the road to President Camacho. I don’t think that the nebulous possibility of dealmaking should tempt liberals to welcome this kind of experiment; I don’t think the hope of a more working-class-friendly G.O.P. should tempt conservative reformers to learn to love it either. And the fact that recent presidents have already pushed the envelope in all kinds of troubling ways is not a “what’s the big deal” case for accepting Trumpism: Noting that George W. Bush approved waterboarding (while insisting that we don’t torture) or that Barack Obama launched wars without congressional approval (while denying they were real wars) is not a case for electing a candidate who’s gleeful in his promises to torture with abandon and rob other countries of their oil; rather, it’s a warning of what the office does to men who are restrained by norms and rules and the tribute that executive vice still has to pay to constitutional virtue.\n\nThe only case for actively embracing a figure like Trump, it seems to me, is if he were the only candidate willing to address a crisis or challenge that’s so existentially or absolutely important that it’s worth gambling our ragged republican norms to see it successfully resolved. This is the vibe I get from certain immigration restrictionists, from the Ann Coulter-Mickey Kaus cohort to, well, more insalubrious voices on the web. And frankly if America were in Germany’s position right now, and voting Trump was the only alternative to admitting 500,000-1,000,000 Middle Eastern migrants every year in perpetuity and/or tearing the country’s politics apart, I might find the case for the Donald a little more persuasive. But one can oppose Rubio-Schumer and other “comprehensive” immigration reforms (and I’ve written a lot of words in opposition) and still recognize 1) that the problems with America’s immigration policy do not pose an existential threat to the republic  and 2) that Trump is about as likely to be a reliable immigration hawk in office as he is to be a reliable anything, which is to say not very. (He’ll boost deportations and build a wall in the first year, sure — but as he’s already promised, it’ll have the biggest, most luxurious door you’ve ever seen.)\n\nWhich is why it’s one thing for people dissatisfied with Conservatism, Inc. and the G.O.P. to be anti-anti-Trump — as I’ve been in the past, and will be again if he fades — and urge the party to take his challenge seriously and co-opt some of his gestures and ideas. But it’s quite another to be actively pro-Trump: Welcoming a would-be strongman because he’s pandering to you on a single issue rarely turns out well, and a vote for the rhinoceros is usually just a good way to end up gored.","gunning_fog_5":"15.2","flesch_5":"16.2","readability_5":"37.98","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton Is Fundamentally Honest and Trustworthy","gold_url":"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/hillary-clinton-fundamentally-honest-and-trustworthy","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"Mother Jones","gold_body":"As we all know, millennials don't care much for Hillary Clinton. That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.5925925925925926},"q1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5925925925925926},"q2":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.9259259259259259},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5925925925925926},"q4":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.9259259259259259},"q5":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6666666666666666},"q6":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.9259259259259259},"q7":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.9259259259259259},"q8":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5925925925925926},"q9":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5925925925925926},"q10":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.9259259259259259},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":0.9259259259259259},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":0.5925925925925926},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":0.5925925925925926},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"donald_trump","confidence":0.5925925925925926}}}

In was the punch line about the White House tapping your cell phone. \nThe Texas senator, who barnstormed Iowa with a preacher's pitch that carried him to victory Monday, unveiled a new stump speech here that signaled a new profile he will try to build as a government-fearing, gun-hugging outsider who will protect New Hampshire from the evils of Washington. \nMaking things easier Wednesday: Rand Paul quit the race. \nWinning libertarian voters has been a centerpiece of the New Hampshire strategy for Cruz, who has flirted with the GOP's libertarian views on foreign policy. Cruz has argued that he is the natural inheritor of the modern libertarian movement built by Ron Paul, which was especially resonant here in New Hampshire, where the elder Paul won second place four years ago. And now, with his son's decision to drop out, Cruz's best path to a strong showing in the bunched GOP field here could be to dominate -- no longer split -- that group of Republicans. \n\"There are a whole bunch of areas that the federal government has no business sticking its nose in,\" Cruz said to hollers here in Hooksett. \"I will fight every day for you, for your freedom, for your right to run a small business, for economic growth and for keeping government the heck off your back.\"\nCruz's entreaties appear to be paying off. A number of state legislators -- in places ranging from here in New Hampshire to the Paul family's Texas -- signed onto the Cruz team. \nOne major Republican megadonor, who had been one of the biggest backers of pro-Paul super PACs, Silicon Valley titan Scott Banister, pledged on Wednesday to Cruz as well -- though he said he has not yet decided to give to a Cruz super PAC. \n\"I've interviewed Ted, and while we don't agree on every issue, I believe he's one of us,\" Banister said in an email to CNN, \"and libertarians will discover that.\" \nCruz's team at the outset of the campaign saw Paul as a top rival for libertarian-minded voters. But as Paul's campaign lagged amid poor fundraising and diminished national support, Cruz meticulously moved onto his turf, sharing libertarian-targeted videos before some Cruz rallies and working behind the scenes to poach several of the Paul family's most loyal activists. \nAnd on Wednesday, Cruz offered a new speech that seemed tailor-made for this state's Republican identity. The Texan still quoted Scripture, but his Christian messaging centered more on a federal lawsuit against a Catholic charity than it did in Iowa. He still called for American leadership in the world, but foreign policy on the whole was giving shorter shrift than it has been for months. \n\"New England was meant to be the new England, the new land,\" he told the crowd in Henniker on Wednesday morning, \"where we could come and be free and not have government dictate our faith, dictate our lives.\" \nAnd Cruz had several opportunities to appeal directly to the Paul family's network, and he appeared eager to do so. After Cruz finished a media availability here almost entirely about the latest attacks from Donald Trump, Cruz walked away -- but then in a rare display for the disciplined candidate, turned around and returned to reporters when asked a shouted question if he had any reaction to Rand's departure. \n\"He and I have been side by side in a great many fights in the U.S. Senate, standing for liberty,\" Cruz told reporters. \"They worked very, very hard.\" \nCruz's new talking points across the southern part of the state on Wednesday scratched the five things he'd do on the first day in office -- moving to U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, looking into the controversial Planned Parenthood videos -- and instead emphasized a more Granite State-hued pitch: celebrating the Second Amendment, sounding the alarm on abuse of eminent domain. \nIn a state like New Hampshire, Cruz's team is betting that pays off. His aides are increasingly optimistic about their fortunes in the state after his momentum from Iowa. But their broader New Hampshire goal -- to bury Marco Rubio beneath less well-funded candidates like John Kasich and Chris Christie -- has become a taller task after Rubio notched a stronger-than-expected third-place showing. \nBut true libertarians say Cruz isn't dyed-in-the-wool enough. At a tavern here in Hillsborough County, Cruz received two separate questions from friends who identified as Rand Paul supporters until Wednesday morning -- and neither felt Cruz did enough to align himself with the movement. \nLeah Wolczko, a 49-year-old state employee, said Cruz was too hawkish on foreign policy and the use of military force by the president. \n\"It's the militancy that gets my hesitation,\" she said, only concluding that Cruz's alignment with the movement was \"okay.\"\nBut he might be the best they've got. Ryan Milner, asked which presidential candidate might be better than Cruz for the movement, came up with a man whose time had passed: \"Ron Paul.\"","gunning_fog_1":"11.2","flesch_1":"11.1","readability_1":"56.59","index_2":"79","title_2":"Op-Ed Columnist: Hillary Clinton Stumbles","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/opinion/hillary-clinton-stumbles.html","candidate_2":"Hillary Clinton","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"In October, when Hillary Clinton made a spectacle of the congressional Benghazi committee during a marathon interrogation that seemed designed to make a spectacle of her, she emerged stronger than ever. Her polls numbers surged.\n\nThat performance had come on the heels of a strong debate performance the week before in the first Democratic presidential debate.\n\nShe had bolstered the image she wanted to project: strong, smart, capable and battle-tested.\n\nBut now, on the verge of Monday night’s Democratic town hall in Iowa — the last time the candidates will face off before the caucuses in that state — and with Bernie Sanders’s poll numbers climbing not only in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign seems increasingly desperate and reckless.\n\nI noticed the turn in the last debate as Clinton seemed to me to go too far in her attacks on Sanders, while simultaneously painting herself into a box that will be very hard to escape.\n\nShe wrapped herself in President Obama’s legacy so tightly that she could hardly breathe, and then built an image of herself as a practical politician who could build on Obama’s accomplishments by taking small steps and negotiating tough deals.\n\nBut practicality and incrementalism, as reasonable as that strategy and persona may be, are simply no match for what animates the Sanders campaign — a kind of kinetic, even if sometimes overblown, idealism. His is a passionate exposition of liberalism — and yes, democratic socialism — in its most positive light.\n\nBut, let me be clear and unequivocal: I find his earnest philosophic positions to be clear and often laudable, but also somewhat quixotic. I think that he is promising far more than even he knows he can deliver, and the electability question is still a real one, even though polls now show him matching up well against possible Republican opponents.\n\nFor instance, Sanders’s plan for universal health care is an admirable ambition of any true liberal, but as presented seems to me unworkable, and the prospect of getting it passed through this Congress or any Congress that vaguely resembles it is nil. Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare, which is far shy of Sanders’s proposal, more than 60 times. Suggesting that it would pass something even more expansive is mere fantasy.\n\nWhen Sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a “political revolution,” which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the Senate and possibly the House.\n\nInteresting, but also unlikely. Go talk to all the Blue Dog Democrats who lost their seats in the wake of Obamacare passage. Go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. Go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure Republican leadership, and therefore prevent Medicaid from being expanded in their states.\n\nThere are political realities that exist in America that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.\n\nFurthermore, Sanders likes to tout that he doesn’t have a “super PAC” and doesn’t want one. That is a principled position. But the Republican candidate will have the support of many super PACs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the Republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. They are going to beat Sanders like a he is a nail with the “socialist” label and his proposal on new taxation. Middle of the spectrum Middle America is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.\n\nBut instead of Clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than Sanders’s, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about Sanders’s honor.\n\nThe swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-Obama because he wanted Obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap Obamacare, simply do not connect.\n\nSanders may be a dreamer, but he’s not dishonorable. Trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.\n\nThere are a tremendous number of echoes starting to be heard between the way Clinton ran against Obama, and the way she is running against Sanders.\n\nClinton has what political insiders call the “firewall”: Overwhelming support among black and Hispanic voters in Southern and some Western states. But a win by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could supply a boost of momentum that could greatly erode the Clinton firewall.\n\nIf Clinton can’t find a positive, energetic message to project, and soon, she is going to be swept away by Sanders.\n\nSome part of Sanders’s proposals and even his vision for this country may indeed be a fairy tale. But in the 2008 race, Bill Clinton criticized Obama and his position on the Iraq war as a “fairy tale.” Well fairy tales sometimes come true, particularly when Hillary Clinton stumbles.","gunning_fog_2":"11.2","flesch_2":"11.1","readability_2":"56.59","index_3":"57","title_3":"Cruz's 2016 strategy focuses on turning out white voters","url_3":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-02-05-US--GOP%202016-Cruz-White%20Turnout/id-b92587c622404c15b18976ec822c1a91","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"the Associated Press","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"(AP)  Ted Cruz has mapped out a path to the White House that all but ignores the explosion of minority voters in America.\nThe Texas senator's general election strategy depends almost wholly upon maximizing turnout among millions of conservative white voters  mostly evangelical Christians and the white working class  who didn't participate in the last presidential contest.\nAt the same time, Cruz's team is banking on a sharp decline in black and Hispanic support for the 2016 Democratic nominee, whoever it is, returning to voter trends before Barack Obama shook up the electorate as the nation's first black president and won an overwhelming share of support from non-white voters.\nIt is a strategy that defies the conventional wisdom in the GOP that says the party can win the White House again only if it appeals to political moderates and non-white voters who are becoming a greater share of the voting-age population as each day passes.\n\"I'm an outlier,\" said longtime Cruz aide Jason Johnson, the chief architect of the Cruz playbook, which he concedes is not in line with modern-day Republican thinking.\nYet with overwhelming confidence born from a year of studying voter trends, Johnson insists the first-term Texas senator can win the general election by motivating a coalition of his party's most reliable supporters.\n\"It is absolutely the case that in 2012, there were a little over 2 million fewer white non-Hispanics that voted compared to 2008,\" Johnson said this week in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They sat it out.\"\nThe strategy will not be tested unless Cruz survives the long road ahead in his party's hotly contested nomination process to represent the GOP in November's general election. Still, general election viability has emerged as a major theme in the days leading up to New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary among the leading Republican candidates.\nMany Washington Republicans warn that Cruz is simply too conservative to appeal to the wide swath of voters that typically decide general elections.\n\"They are just wrong about this,\" said Republican operative Matthew Dowd, who served as the chief political strategist for George W. Bush. \"It is about both motivation and persuasion. You can't motivate your base and at same time turn off moderates and independents.\"\nBut Cruz this week repeatedly declared that his team assembled a coalition in Iowa that would translate into general election success.\n\"We saw conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats all coming together,\" he said during a town hall-style meeting at a Portsmouth Toyota dealership. \"If we're going to win, if we're going to win the nomination and we're going to win the general election, we've got to bring that coalition together.\"\n\"That's what it's going to take to win the general election,\" he said.\nThe Cruz strategy is born by necessity.\nWhile his team notes he won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 2012 Senate election in Texas, and Cruz has the potential to become the nation's first Hispanic president, hardline conservative rhetoric on illegal immigration has defined his short political career. He has promoted endorsements from far-right conservatives such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, Cruz's national campaign co-chairman who has compared immigrants in the country illegally to drug mules and livestock.\nGOP leaders commissioned an exhaustive report after the 2012 elections calling for candidates to adopt more welcoming tones on immigration. But a hardline stance on immigration remains popular among white voters across America who make up the majority  albeit a shrinking majority  of the voting-age population and tend to vote Republican.\nTrump's sustained popularity is based in part on such anti-immigrant rhetoric. And more than 60 percent of Republicans polled by CNN last summer said the U.S. government should focus on stopping the flow of immigrants in the country illegally and deporting those already here. About 30 percent of Democrats said the same.\nJohnson, Cruz's top strategist, believes that Cruz can win in November even if he earns only 30 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally  a modest increase from Mitt Romney's 27 percent four years ago. And among black voters, Johnson envisions Cruz winning over roughly 10 percent, which is in line with the GOP's performance in 2000 and 2004.\nCruz has no plans to back off his hardline stance on immigration. His team has determined there is no evidence that immigration policy alone is a major factor win winning over Hispanic voters.\n\"It's not a panacea,\" Johnson said of immigration reform, citing internal and public polling. \"Even if we had to do better than 30 percent, that wouldn't do it.\"\nYet the country's demographic shifts have prompted some Republicans to reach the opposite conclusion and work harder to appeal to non-white voters, who by 2052 will make up a majority of the eligible voting-age population, according to a study by conducted last year by Washington think tanks representing both parties.\nGOP leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and recently departed presidential candidate Rand Paul have spoken extensively about poverty alleviation and criminal justice reform  issues that particularly resonate among black and Hispanic voters.\nThe share of all voters nationwide who are white has dropped consistently since 1996, according to census data. Even 2004, a year in which the total number of white voters increased by more than 10 million, failed to reverse that trend.\nYet Cruz's team is correct to note that millions of white voters sat out the 2012 elections. Census voting data shows about 2 million fewer white voters cast ballots in 2012 than 2008  the only time since 1996 that the total number of votes cast by a racial group has decreased from one presidential election to the next.\nSome Republican strategists, including Dowd, suggest the missing voters are concentrated in states that aren't likely to be contested in the general election. They argue that even if Cruz gets them to vote, they won't improve his November prospects.\nCruz's team won't ignore minority voters altogether. The campaign has an African-American outreach director, and Cruz this week promised to campaign in Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods at some point. His major challenge is to drive white turnout while not completely alienating minorities.\n\"You can't just go out and throw red meat on the table just because you know it will help turnout on one side of the equation,\" he said. \"We're either right or wrong.\"\n___\nAssociated Press News Survey Specialist Emily Swanson contributed to this report from Washington.\n___\nFollow Steve Peoples on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/sppeoples","gunning_fog_3":"10.4","flesch_3":"11.5","readability_3":"50.16","index_4":"2","title_4":"Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders Relies on Supporters for Ad About Unity","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/politics/bernie-sanders-relies-on-supporters-for-ad-about-unity.html","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"After letting Simon and Garfunkel speak for him in one ad, Senator Bernie Sanders has turned over his latest to his supporters, several of whom created a 60-second spot titled “Together.”\n\nOnly Mr. Sanders’s voice is heard, delivering a clarion call to unite Americans across every conceivable demographic line. But on the screen, portraits of scores of different faces appear and disappear in a blink. Many are ripped in half, as if to illustrate the danger of divisive politics. Old snapshots of families of every possible background flash by. Finally, the two halves of unrelated people’s portraits are merged, to signal the strength that comes from uniting people despite their differences.\n\nAdding to its power is the ad’s back story: It was submitted by supporters of Mr. Sanders and chosen by curators of such content in an effort overseen by his wife, Jane. In a sense, then, others are already taking up the banner of the revolution Mr. Sanders is trying to foment.\n\nThat revolution is possible only with the broadest popular support. “Our job is not to divide,” Mr. Sanders shouts. “Our job is to bring people together.” It does not hurt that this message of unity is well timed, as Mr. Sanders seeks to expand his appeal among blacks in South Carolina, Latinos in Nevada and other constituencies as his primary battle with Hillary Clinton expands nationally.\n\nThe spot began its life as a short video, shown on a big screen before the band Vampire Weekend performed an acoustic set at a Sanders campaign rally in Iowa City. The crowd erupted as the video reached its conclusion. Since then it has gone viral, earning millions of views and comparisons to President Obama’s 2008 “Yes We Can” ad. Seeing the video’s popularity, the campaign bought the ad on Friday and said it would begin airing it this week.\n\nElection contests are, by their nature, divisive.

A fight with the Pope?","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/opinions/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-dantonio/index.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n (CNN)  Donald Trump once told me, \"I always loved to fight.\"  But even those of us who know him and his fighting mentality have to marvel at his ability to find new battles. I mean really, Donald, you're going to argue with the Pope? About Christianity?\nTo be fair, from the Trumpian viewpoint, Pope Francis sort of started it. He decided to make a pilgrimage to Mexico and to include a visit to the border where Trump proposes to build a huge wall to keep people out. A champion of the poor and the suffering, Francis has visited slums all over the world and washed the feet of homeless men and women. \nBut for Trump, the trip to Mexico, where just about everyone is Catholic and about half the population lives in poverty, was a step too far.    \n\"I think that the Pope is a very political person,\" Trump said in a TV interview last week. \nHe then wondered whether maybe Francis was a pawn of the Mexican government. \"I don't think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico,\" said Trump. \"I think Mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is. They're making a fortune, and we're losing.\"\nTrump's pre-emptive strike, made before the Pope even left Rome, was a play for votes in South Carolina, where religious tradition includes longstanding suspicions about the Catholic Church.  Criticizing the Pope also gave Trump yet another turn in the media spotlight, which is a place he finds quite comfortable. \nBesides, who else was the fighter going to tangle with? \nHis Republican opponents seem incapable of giving Trump a real contest, and nobody in the news media was causing him to sweat. Trump was probably getting bored. Thanks to Francis, he's not bored now.\nThough as different from Trump as love is from anger, Francis is similar to him in one way: He says what he thinks. Early in his papacy, he shocked fellow Catholics when reporters asked him about homosexuality -- a subject long anathema to the Vatican -- and he answered, \"Who am I to judge?\" \nWhen told of Trump's criticisms as he flew home from Mexico on Thursday, the Pope said, \"Thank God he said I am a political man. Because Aristotle defines a human being as a political animal: At least I am a human being. Am I a pawn? Well maybe. I will leave that up to your judgment. And a person who only thinks about making wall, wherever it may be, and not building bridges, is not a Christian.\" \nLike Trump, the Pope does not speak without purpose. \nHe has doubtlessly followed the American presidential campaign more closely that Trump has followed the news from the Vatican. And just as Trump fights to win whatever prize he has in mind, the Pope has fought doggedly on behalf of the poor.\nHe has criticized world leaders for failing to lift-up humanity, and he has chastised leaders of his own Church for living lavishly while members of their flocks suffer.  His Christianity is defined by the Jesus who threw the money changers out of the temple. \nIn his own effort to be Christian, he aligns himself with refugees and victims of drug trafficking and has expressed that he would err on the side of open arms and open borders.  This has been his response to the refugee crisis in Europe. Is it any wonder he would criticize Trump's plan mass deportations and massive wall? \nIn this latest controversy, Trump, has followed his usual strategy of keeping up the fight, no matter what.\nHe answered the Pope by saying: \"He doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation\" and complaining that \"for a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. ... No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn, and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.\" \nOf course, Francis considers Christianity his area of expertise in the same way that Trump imagines that money and power are his. And he is less inclined than Trump to be shy about stating his beliefs. When he celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus, last December, he offered a very un-Trumpian homily that included this:\n\"In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this Child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential. ... Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy, drawn daily from the wellspring of prayer.\"\nMaybe Trump heard the Christmas homily and took it personally. Maybe he understood that the Pontiff -- Latin for bridge-builder -- would join the battle of ideas. \nCertainly Francis is not likely to back down. He is as transformational for the church as Trump is in politics. Humble and empathetic, he might apologize for hurting Trump's feelings. But he won't abandon his position. He will always prefer bridges to walls. \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.\n","gunning_fog_5":"8.8","flesch_5":"8.7","readability_5":"62.68","gold_title":" This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest","gold_url":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The Guardian","gold_body":"t’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.729166666666667,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T00:05:22+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952843436,"created_at":"2016-04-07T23:30:14+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T23:16:28+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"zoombucks","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"IN","city":"Noblesville","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915123,"worker_id":9383666,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":1.0,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"-1","q4":"1","q5":"0","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"-1","q9":"-1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"5064","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"john_kasich"},"unit_data":{"nil":"17","index_1":"55","title_1":"Ted Cruz tries to seize Rand Paul's libertarian mantle","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/ted-cruz-new-hampshire-rand-paul/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Goffstown, New Hampshire (CNN)  Ted Cruz isn't in Iowa anymore. \nGone Wednesday morning was the vow to investigate Planned Parenthood. In was the punch line about the White House tapping your cell phone. \nThe Texas senator, who barnstormed Iowa with a preacher's pitch that carried him to victory Monday, unveiled a new stump speech here that signaled a new profile he will try to build as a government-fearing, gun-hugging outsider who will protect New Hampshire from the evils of Washington. \nMaking things easier Wednesday: Rand Paul quit the race. \nWinning libertarian voters has been a centerpiece of the New Hampshire strategy for Cruz, who has flirted with the GOP's libertarian views on foreign policy. Cruz has argued that he is the natural inheritor of the modern libertarian movement built by Ron Paul, which was especially resonant here in New Hampshire, where the elder Paul won second place four years ago. And now, with his son's decision to drop out, Cruz's best path to a strong showing in the bunched GOP field here could be to dominate -- no longer split -- that group of Republicans. \n\"There are a whole bunch of areas that the federal government has no business sticking its nose in,\" Cruz said to hollers here in Hooksett. \"I will fight every day for you, for your freedom, for your right to run a small business, for economic growth and for keeping government the heck off your back.\"\nCruz's entreaties appear to be paying off. A number of state legislators -- in places ranging from here in New Hampshire to the Paul family's Texas -- signed onto the Cruz team. \nOne major Republican megadonor, who had been one of the biggest backers of pro-Paul super PACs, Silicon Valley titan Scott Banister, pledged on Wednesday to Cruz as well -- though he said he has not yet decided to give to a Cruz super PAC. \n\"I've interviewed Ted, and while we don't agree on every issue, I believe he's one of us,\" Banister said in an email to CNN, \"and libertarians will discover that.\" \nCruz's team at the outset of the campaign saw Paul as a top rival for libertarian-minded voters. But as Paul's campaign lagged amid poor fundraising and diminished national support, Cruz meticulously moved onto his turf, sharing libertarian-targeted videos before some Cruz rallies and working behind the scenes to poach several of the Paul family's most loyal activists. \nAnd on Wednesday, Cruz offered a new speech that seemed tailor-made for this state's Republican identity. The Texan still quoted Scripture, but his Christian messaging centered more on a federal lawsuit against a Catholic charity than it did in Iowa. He still called for American leadership in the world, but foreign policy on the whole was giving shorter shrift than it has been for months. \n\"New England was meant to be the new England, the new land,\" he told the crowd in Henniker on Wednesday morning, \"where we could come and be free and not have government dictate our faith, dictate our lives.\" \nAnd Cruz had several opportunities to appeal directly to the Paul family's network, and he appeared eager to do so. After Cruz finished a media availability here almost entirely about the latest attacks from Donald Trump, Cruz walked away -- but then in a rare display for the disciplined candidate, turned around and returned to reporters when asked a shouted question if he had any reaction to Rand's departure. \n\"He and I have been side by side in a great many fights in the U.S. Senate, standing for liberty,\" Cruz told reporters. \"They worked very, very hard.\" \nCruz's new talking points across the southern part of the state on Wednesday scratched the five things he'd do on the first day in office -- moving to U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, looking into the controversial Planned Parenthood videos -- and instead emphasized a more Granite State-hued pitch: celebrating the Second Amendment, sounding the alarm on abuse of eminent domain. \nIn a state like New Hampshire, Cruz's team is betting that pays off. His aides are increasingly optimistic about their fortunes in the state after his momentum from Iowa. But their broader New Hampshire goal -- to bury Marco Rubio beneath less well-funded candidates like John Kasich and Chris Christie -- has become a taller task after Rubio notched a stronger-than-expected third-place showing. \nBut true libertarians say Cruz isn't dyed-in-the-wool enough. At a tavern here in Hillsborough County, Cruz received two separate questions from friends who identified as Rand Paul supporters until Wednesday morning -- and neither felt Cruz did enough to align himself with the movement. \nLeah Wolczko, a 49-year-old state employee, said Cruz was too hawkish on foreign policy and the use of military force by the president. \n\"It's the militancy that gets my hesitation,\" she said, only concluding that Cruz's alignment with the movement was \"okay.\"\nBut he might be the best they've got. Ryan Milner, asked which presidential candidate might be better than Cruz for the movement, came up with a man whose time had passed: \"Ron Paul.\"","gunning_fog_1":"11.2","flesch_1":"11.1","readability_1":"56.59","index_2":"79","title_2":"Op-Ed Columnist: Hillary Clinton Stumbles","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/opinion/hillary-clinton-stumbles.html","candidate_2":"Hillary Clinton","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"In October, when Hillary Clinton made a spectacle of the congressional Benghazi committee during a marathon interrogation that seemed designed to make a spectacle of her, she emerged stronger than ever. Her polls numbers surged.\n\nThat performance had come on the heels of a strong debate performance the week before in the first Democratic presidential debate.\n\nShe had bolstered the image she wanted to project: strong, smart, capable and battle-tested.\n\nBut now, on the verge of Monday night’s Democratic town hall in Iowa — the last time the candidates will face off before the caucuses in that state — and with Bernie Sanders’s poll numbers climbing not only in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign seems increasingly desperate and reckless.\n\nI noticed the turn in the last debate as Clinton seemed to me to go too far in her attacks on Sanders, while simultaneously painting herself into a box that will be very hard to escape.\n\nShe wrapped herself in President Obama’s legacy so tightly that she could hardly breathe, and then built an image of herself as a practical politician who could build on Obama’s accomplishments by taking small steps and negotiating tough deals.\n\nBut practicality and incrementalism, as reasonable as that strategy and persona may be, are simply no match for what animates the Sanders campaign — a kind of kinetic, even if sometimes overblown, idealism. His is a passionate exposition of liberalism — and yes, democratic socialism — in its most positive light.\n\nBut, let me be clear and unequivocal: I find his earnest philosophic positions to be clear and often laudable, but also somewhat quixotic. I think that he is promising far more than even he knows he can deliver, and the electability question is still a real one, even though polls now show him matching up well against possible Republican opponents.\n\nFor instance, Sanders’s plan for universal health care is an admirable ambition of any true liberal, but as presented seems to me unworkable, and the prospect of getting it passed through this Congress or any Congress that vaguely resembles it is nil. Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare, which is far shy of Sanders’s proposal, more than 60 times. Suggesting that it would pass something even more expansive is mere fantasy.\n\nWhen Sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a “political revolution,” which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the Senate and possibly the House.\n\nInteresting, but also unlikely. Go talk to all the Blue Dog Democrats who lost their seats in the wake of Obamacare passage. Go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. Go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure Republican leadership, and therefore prevent Medicaid from being expanded in their states.\n\nThere are political realities that exist in America that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.\n\nFurthermore, Sanders likes to tout that he doesn’t have a “super PAC” and doesn’t want one. That is a principled position. But the Republican candidate will have the support of many super PACs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the Republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. They are going to beat Sanders like a he is a nail with the “socialist” label and his proposal on new taxation. Middle of the spectrum Middle America is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.\n\nBut instead of Clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than Sanders’s, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about Sanders’s honor.\n\nThe swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-Obama because he wanted Obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap Obamacare, simply do not connect.\n\nSanders may be a dreamer, but he’s not dishonorable. Trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.\n\nThere are a tremendous number of echoes starting to be heard between the way Clinton ran against Obama, and the way she is running against Sanders.\n\nClinton has what political insiders call the “firewall”: Overwhelming support among black and Hispanic voters in Southern and some Western states. But a win by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could supply a boost of momentum that could greatly erode the Clinton firewall.\n\nIf Clinton can’t find a positive, energetic message to project, and soon, she is going to be swept away by Sanders.\n\nSome part of Sanders’s proposals and even his vision for this country may indeed be a fairy tale. But in the 2008 race, Bill Clinton criticized Obama and his position on the Iraq war as a “fairy tale.” Well fairy tales sometimes come true, particularly when Hillary Clinton stumbles.","gunning_fog_2":"11.2","flesch_2":"11.1","readability_2":"56.59","index_3":"57","title_3":"Cruz's 2016 strategy focuses on turning out white voters","url_3":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-02-05-US--GOP%202016-Cruz-White%20Turnout/id-b92587c622404c15b18976ec822c1a91","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"the Associated Press","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"(AP)  Ted Cruz has mapped out a path to the White House that all but ignores the explosion of minority voters in America.\nThe Texas senator's general election strategy depends almost wholly upon maximizing turnout among millions of conservative white voters  mostly evangelical Christians and the white working class  who didn't participate in the last presidential contest.\nAt the same time, Cruz's team is banking on a sharp decline in black and Hispanic support for the 2016 Democratic nominee, whoever it is, returning to voter trends before Barack Obama shook up the electorate as the nation's first black president and won an overwhelming share of support from non-white voters.\nIt is a strategy that defies the conventional wisdom in the GOP that says the party can win the White House again only if it appeals to political moderates and non-white voters who are becoming a greater share of the voting-age population as each day passes.\n\"I'm an outlier,\" said longtime Cruz aide Jason Johnson, the chief architect of the Cruz playbook, which he concedes is not in line with modern-day Republican thinking.\nYet with overwhelming confidence born from a year of studying voter trends, Johnson insists the first-term Texas senator can win the general election by motivating a coalition of his party's most reliable supporters.\n\"It is absolutely the case that in 2012, there were a little over 2 million fewer white non-Hispanics that voted compared to 2008,\" Johnson said this week in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They sat it out.\"\nThe strategy will not be tested unless Cruz survives the long road ahead in his party's hotly contested nomination process to represent the GOP in November's general election. Still, general election viability has emerged as a major theme in the days leading up to New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary among the leading Republican candidates.\nMany Washington Republicans warn that Cruz is simply too conservative to appeal to the wide swath of voters that typically decide general elections.\n\"They are just wrong about this,\" said Republican operative Matthew Dowd, who served as the chief political strategist for George W. Bush. \"It is about both motivation and persuasion. You can't motivate your base and at same time turn off moderates and independents.\"\nBut Cruz this week repeatedly declared that his team assembled a coalition in Iowa that would translate into general election success.\n\"We saw conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats all coming together,\" he said during a town hall-style meeting at a Portsmouth Toyota dealership. \"If we're going to win, if we're going to win the nomination and we're going to win the general election, we've got to bring that coalition together.\"\n\"That's what it's going to take to win the general election,\" he said.\nThe Cruz strategy is born by necessity.\nWhile his team notes he won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 2012 Senate election in Texas, and Cruz has the potential to become the nation's first Hispanic president, hardline conservative rhetoric on illegal immigration has defined his short political career. He has promoted endorsements from far-right conservatives such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, Cruz's national campaign co-chairman who has compared immigrants in the country illegally to drug mules and livestock.\nGOP leaders commissioned an exhaustive report after the 2012 elections calling for candidates to adopt more welcoming tones on immigration. But a hardline stance on immigration remains popular among white voters across America who make up the majority  albeit a shrinking majority  of the voting-age population and tend to vote Republican.\nTrump's sustained popularity is based in part on such anti-immigrant rhetoric. And more than 60 percent of Republicans polled by CNN last summer said the U.S. government should focus on stopping the flow of immigrants in the country illegally and deporting those already here. About 30 percent of Democrats said the same.\nJohnson, Cruz's top strategist, believes that Cruz can win in November even if he earns only 30 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally  a modest increase from Mitt Romney's 27 percent four years ago. And among black voters, Johnson envisions Cruz winning over roughly 10 percent, which is in line with the GOP's performance in 2000 and 2004.\nCruz has no plans to back off his hardline stance on immigration. His team has determined there is no evidence that immigration policy alone is a major factor win winning over Hispanic voters.\n\"It's not a panacea,\" Johnson said of immigration reform, citing internal and public polling. \"Even if we had to do better than 30 percent, that wouldn't do it.\"\nYet the country's demographic shifts have prompted some Republicans to reach the opposite conclusion and work harder to appeal to non-white voters, who by 2052 will make up a majority of the eligible voting-age population, according to a study by conducted last year by Washington think tanks representing both parties.\nGOP leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and recently departed presidential candidate Rand Paul have spoken extensively about poverty alleviation and criminal justice reform  issues that particularly resonate among black and Hispanic voters.\nThe share of all voters nationwide who are white has dropped consistently since 1996, according to census data. Even 2004, a year in which the total number of white voters increased by more than 10 million, failed to reverse that trend.\nYet Cruz's team is correct to note that millions of white voters sat out the 2012 elections. Census voting data shows about 2 million fewer white voters cast ballots in 2012 than 2008  the only time since 1996 that the total number of votes cast by a racial group has decreased from one presidential election to the next.\nSome Republican strategists, including Dowd, suggest the missing voters are concentrated in states that aren't likely to be contested in the general election. They argue that even if Cruz gets them to vote, they won't improve his November prospects.\nCruz's team won't ignore minority voters altogether. The campaign has an African-American outreach director, and Cruz this week promised to campaign in Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods at some point. His major challenge is to drive white turnout while not completely alienating minorities.\n\"You can't just go out and throw red meat on the table just because you know it will help turnout on one side of the equation,\" he said. \"We're either right or wrong.\"\n___\nAssociated Press News Survey Specialist Emily Swanson contributed to this report from Washington.\n___\nFollow Steve Peoples on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/sppeoples","gunning_fog_3":"10.4","flesch_3":"11.5","readability_3":"50.16","index_4":"2","title_4":"Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders Relies on Supporters for Ad About Unity","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/politics/bernie-sanders-relies-on-supporters-for-ad-about-unity.html","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"After letting Simon and Garfunkel speak for him in one ad, Senator Bernie Sanders has turned over his latest to his supporters, several of whom created a 60-second spot titled “Together.”\n\nOnly Mr. Sanders’s voice is heard, delivering a clarion call to unite Americans across every conceivable demographic line.

Finally, the two halves of unrelated people’s portraits are merged, to signal the strength that comes from uniting people despite their differences.\n\nAdding to its power is the ad’s back story: It was submitted by supporters of Mr. Sanders and chosen by curators of such content in an effort overseen by his wife, Jane. In a sense, then, others are already taking up the banner of the revolution Mr. Sanders is trying to foment.\n\nThat revolution is possible only with the broadest popular support. “Our job is not to divide,” Mr. Sanders shouts. “Our job is to bring people together.” It does not hurt that this message of unity is well timed, as Mr. Sanders seeks to expand his appeal among blacks in South Carolina, Latinos in Nevada and other constituencies as his primary battle with Hillary Clinton expands nationally.\n\nThe spot began its life as a short video, shown on a big screen before the band Vampire Weekend performed an acoustic set at a Sanders campaign rally in Iowa City. The crowd erupted as the video reached its conclusion. Since then it has gone viral, earning millions of views and comparisons to President Obama’s 2008 “Yes We Can” ad. Seeing the video’s popularity, the campaign bought the ad on Friday and said it would begin airing it this week.\n\nElection contests are, by their nature, divisive. But amid the testy debates and stump speech sniping, this ad reminds viewers that the campaign is ultimately about everyone — a rare injection of togetherness when the nation is being coldly deconstructed by candidates and their strategists into a jigsaw puzzle in either red or blue.\n\nChanging channels ...\n\nSenator Ted Cruz’s campaign did not know it at the time, but the actress hired to deliver the money line in a negative ad against Senator Marco Rubio — calling him “just a pretty face” — had starred in soft-core pornographic films. When the campaign was apprised of her filmography, the ad was quickly pulled.\n\nRight to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, released a highlight reel of Donald J. Trump’s most boorish moments, portraying Mr. Trump as a coward and Mr. Bush as “the better man.” At the end, it cut to the comically awkward entrances of the candidates at the last debate: With Mr. Trump oddly waiting in the wings with Ben Carson, Mr. Bush emerges from behind them, pats Mr. Trump on the shoulder, then cocks an eyebrow and smirks as he strides by, never looking back.\n\nA 1992 hip-hop song, “Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta,” found immortality on the soundtrack of the cult-favorite film “Office Space” in 1999. Mr. Cruz’s campaign, continuing a string of satirical ads, spoofed the song in a spot mocking Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. “Damn it feels good to be a Clinton,” the lyrics say.\n\n$30 million: The amount spent on negative ads broadcast on New Hampshire television stations over the past year by presidential candidates and their allies.\n\n$27 million: The amount spent on negative ads nationwide by Right to Rise alone.","gunning_fog_4":"8.0","flesch_4":"6.8","readability_4":"73.17","index_5":"103","title_5":"Really, Donald Trump? A fight with the Pope?","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/opinions/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-dantonio/index.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n (CNN)  Donald Trump once told me, \"I always loved to fight.\"  But even those of us who know him and his fighting mentality have to marvel at his ability to find new battles. I mean really, Donald, you're going to argue with the Pope? About Christianity?\nTo be fair, from the Trumpian viewpoint, Pope Francis sort of started it. He decided to make a pilgrimage to Mexico and to include a visit to the border where Trump proposes to build a huge wall to keep people out. A champion of the poor and the suffering, Francis has visited slums all over the world and washed the feet of homeless men and women. \nBut for Trump, the trip to Mexico, where just about everyone is Catholic and about half the population lives in poverty, was a step too far.    \n\"I think that the Pope is a very political person,\" Trump said in a TV interview last week. \nHe then wondered whether maybe Francis was a pawn of the Mexican government. \"I don't think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico,\" said Trump. \"I think Mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is. They're making a fortune, and we're losing.\"\nTrump's pre-emptive strike, made before the Pope even left Rome, was a play for votes in South Carolina, where religious tradition includes longstanding suspicions about the Catholic Church.  Criticizing the Pope also gave Trump yet another turn in the media spotlight, which is a place he finds quite comfortable. \nBesides, who else was the fighter going to tangle with? \nHis Republican opponents seem incapable of giving Trump a real contest, and nobody in the news media was causing him to sweat. Trump was probably getting bored. Thanks to Francis, he's not bored now.\nThough as different from Trump as love is from anger, Francis is similar to him in one way: He says what he thinks. Early in his papacy, he shocked fellow Catholics when reporters asked him about homosexuality -- a subject long anathema to the Vatican -- and he answered, \"Who am I to judge?\" \nWhen told of Trump's criticisms as he flew home from Mexico on Thursday, the Pope said, \"Thank God he said I am a political man. Because Aristotle defines a human being as a political animal: At least I am a human being. Am I a pawn? Well maybe. I will leave that up to your judgment. And a person who only thinks about making wall, wherever it may be, and not building bridges, is not a Christian.\" \nLike Trump, the Pope does not speak without purpose. \nHe has doubtlessly followed the American presidential campaign more closely that Trump has followed the news from the Vatican. And just as Trump fights to win whatever prize he has in mind, the Pope has fought doggedly on behalf of the poor.\nHe has criticized world leaders for failing to lift-up humanity, and he has chastised leaders of his own Church for living lavishly while members of their flocks suffer.  His Christianity is defined by the Jesus who threw the money changers out of the temple. \nIn his own effort to be Christian, he aligns himself with refugees and victims of drug trafficking and has expressed that he would err on the side of open arms and open borders.  This has been his response to the refugee crisis in Europe. Is it any wonder he would criticize Trump's plan mass deportations and massive wall? \nIn this latest controversy, Trump, has followed his usual strategy of keeping up the fight, no matter what.\nHe answered the Pope by saying: \"He doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation\" and complaining that \"for a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. ... No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn, and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.\" \nOf course, Francis considers Christianity his area of expertise in the same way that Trump imagines that money and power are his. And he is less inclined than Trump to be shy about stating his beliefs. When he celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus, last December, he offered a very un-Trumpian homily that included this:\n\"In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this Child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential. ... Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy, drawn daily from the wellspring of prayer.\"\nMaybe Trump heard the Christmas homily and took it personally. Maybe he understood that the Pontiff -- Latin for bridge-builder -- would join the battle of ideas. \nCertainly Francis is not likely to back down. He is as transformational for the church as Trump is in politics. Humble and empathetic, he might apologize for hurting Trump's feelings. But he won't abandon his position. He will always prefer bridges to walls. \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.\n","gunning_fog_5":"8.8","flesch_5":"8.7","readability_5":"62.68","gold_title":" This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest","gold_url":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The Guardian","gold_body":"t’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}},{"id":1952848381,"created_at":"2016-04-07T23:37:14+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T23:22:40+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"instagc","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"MI","city":"Battle Creek","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915123,"worker_id":21088425,"trust":0.75,"worker_trust":1.0,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"-1","q4":"1","q5":"-1","q6":"1","q7":"0","q8":"0","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"5064","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"17","index_1":"55","title_1":"Ted Cruz tries to seize Rand Paul's libertarian mantle","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/ted-cruz-new-hampshire-rand-paul/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Goffstown, New Hampshire (CNN)  Ted Cruz isn't in Iowa anymore. \nGone Wednesday morning was the vow to investigate Planned Parenthood. In was the punch line about the White House tapping your cell phone. \nThe Texas senator, who barnstormed Iowa with a preacher's pitch that carried him to victory Monday, unveiled a new stump speech here that signaled a new profile he will try to build as a government-fearing, gun-hugging outsider who will protect New Hampshire from the evils of Washington. \nMaking things easier Wednesday: Rand Paul quit the race. \nWinning libertarian voters has been a centerpiece of the New Hampshire strategy for Cruz, who has flirted with the GOP's libertarian views on foreign policy. Cruz has argued that he is the natural inheritor of the modern libertarian movement built by Ron Paul, which was especially resonant here in New Hampshire, where the elder Paul won second place four years ago. And now, with his son's decision to drop out, Cruz's best path to a strong showing in the bunched GOP field here could be to dominate -- no longer split -- that group of Republicans. \n\"There are a whole bunch of areas that the federal government has no business sticking its nose in,\" Cruz said to hollers here in Hooksett. \"I will fight every day for you, for your freedom, for your right to run a small business, for economic growth and for keeping government the heck off your back.\"\nCruz's entreaties appear to be paying off. A number of state legislators -- in places ranging from here in New Hampshire to the Paul family's Texas -- signed onto the Cruz team. \nOne major Republican megadonor, who had been one of the biggest backers of pro-Paul super PACs, Silicon Valley titan Scott Banister, pledged on Wednesday to Cruz as well -- though he said he has not yet decided to give to a Cruz super PAC. \n\"I've interviewed Ted, and while we don't agree on every issue, I believe he's one of us,\" Banister said in an email to CNN, \"and libertarians will discover that.\" \nCruz's team at the outset of the campaign saw Paul as a top rival for libertarian-minded voters. But as Paul's campaign lagged amid poor fundraising and diminished national support, Cruz meticulously moved onto his turf, sharing libertarian-targeted videos before some Cruz rallies and working behind the scenes to poach several of the Paul family's most loyal activists. \nAnd on Wednesday, Cruz offered a new speech that seemed tailor-made for this state's Republican identity. The Texan still quoted Scripture, but his Christian messaging centered more on a federal lawsuit against a Catholic charity than it did in Iowa. He still called for American leadership in the world, but foreign policy on the whole was giving shorter shrift than it has been for months. \n\"New England was meant to be the new England, the new land,\" he told the crowd in Henniker on Wednesday morning, \"where we could come and be free and not have government dictate our faith, dictate our lives.\" \nAnd Cruz had several opportunities to appeal directly to the Paul family's network, and he appeared eager to do so. After Cruz finished a media availability here almost entirely about the latest attacks from Donald Trump, Cruz walked away -- but then in a rare display for the disciplined candidate, turned around and returned to reporters when asked a shouted question if he had any reaction to Rand's departure. \n\"He and I have been side by side in a great many fights in the U.S. Senate, standing for liberty,\" Cruz told reporters. \"They worked very, very hard.\" \nCruz's new talking points across the southern part of the state on Wednesday scratched the five things he'd do on the first day in office -- moving to U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, looking into the controversial Planned Parenthood videos -- and instead emphasized a more Granite State-hued pitch: celebrating the Second Amendment, sounding the alarm on abuse of eminent domain. \nIn a state like New Hampshire, Cruz's team is betting that pays off. His aides are increasingly optimistic about their fortunes in the state after his momentum from Iowa. But their broader New Hampshire goal -- to bury Marco Rubio beneath less well-funded candidates like John Kasich and Chris Christie -- has become a taller task after Rubio notched a stronger-than-expected third-place showing. \nBut true libertarians say Cruz isn't dyed-in-the-wool enough. At a tavern here in Hillsborough County, Cruz received two separate questions from friends who identified as Rand Paul supporters until Wednesday morning -- and neither felt Cruz did enough to align himself with the movement. \nLeah Wolczko, a 49-year-old state employee, said Cruz was too hawkish on foreign policy and the use of military force by the president. \n\"It's the militancy that gets my hesitation,\" she said, only concluding that Cruz's alignment with the movement was \"okay.\"\nBut he might be the best they've got. Ryan Milner, asked which presidential candidate might be better than Cruz for the movement, came up with a man whose time had passed: \"Ron Paul.\"","gunning_fog_1":"11.2","flesch_1":"11.1","readability_1":"56.59","index_2":"79","title_2":"Op-Ed Columnist: Hillary Clinton Stumbles","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/opinion/hillary-clinton-stumbles.html","candidate_2":"Hillary Clinton","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"In October, when Hillary Clinton made a spectacle of the congressional Benghazi committee during a marathon interrogation that seemed designed to make a spectacle of her, she emerged stronger than ever. Her polls numbers surged.\n\nThat performance had come on the heels of a strong debate performance the week before in the first Democratic presidential debate.\n\nShe had bolstered the image she wanted to project: strong, smart, capable and battle-tested.\n\nBut now, on the verge of Monday night’s Democratic town hall in Iowa — the last time the candidates will face off before the caucuses in that state — and with Bernie Sanders’s poll numbers climbing not only in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign seems increasingly desperate and reckless.\n\nI noticed the turn in the last debate as Clinton seemed to me to go too far in her attacks on Sanders, while simultaneously painting herself into a box that will be very hard to escape.\n\nShe wrapped herself in President Obama’s legacy so tightly that she could hardly breathe, and then built an image of herself as a practical politician who could build on Obama’s accomplishments by taking small steps and negotiating tough deals.\n\nBut practicality and incrementalism, as reasonable as that strategy and persona may be, are simply no match for what animates the Sanders campaign — a kind of kinetic, even if sometimes overblown, idealism. His is a passionate exposition of liberalism — and yes, democratic socialism — in its most positive light.\n\nBut, let me be clear and unequivocal: I find his earnest philosophic positions to be clear and often laudable, but also somewhat quixotic. I think that he is promising far more than even he knows he can deliver, and the electability question is still a real one, even though polls now show him matching up well against possible Republican opponents.\n\nFor instance, Sanders’s plan for universal health care is an admirable ambition of any true liberal, but as presented seems to me unworkable, and the prospect of getting it passed through this Congress or any Congress that vaguely resembles it is nil. Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare, which is far shy of Sanders’s proposal, more than 60 times. Suggesting that it would pass something even more expansive is mere fantasy.\n\nWhen Sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a “political revolution,” which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the Senate and possibly the House.\n\nInteresting, but also unlikely. Go talk to all the Blue Dog Democrats who lost their seats in the wake of Obamacare passage. Go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. Go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure Republican leadership, and therefore prevent Medicaid from being expanded in their states.\n\nThere are political realities that exist in America that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.\n\nFurthermore, Sanders likes to tout that he doesn’t have a “super PAC” and doesn’t want one. That is a principled position. But the Republican candidate will have the support of many super PACs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the Republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. They are going to beat Sanders like a he is a nail with the “socialist” label and his proposal on new taxation. Middle of the spectrum Middle America is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.\n\nBut instead of Clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than Sanders’s, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about Sanders’s honor.\n\nThe swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-Obama because he wanted Obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap Obamacare, simply do not connect.\n\nSanders may be a dreamer, but he’s not dishonorable. Trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.\n\nThere are a tremendous number of echoes starting to be heard between the way Clinton ran against Obama, and the way she is running against Sanders.\n\nClinton has what political insiders call the “firewall”: Overwhelming support among black and Hispanic voters in Southern and some Western states. But a win by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could supply a boost of momentum that could greatly erode the Clinton firewall.\n\nIf Clinton can’t find a positive, energetic message to project, and soon, she is going to be swept away by Sanders.\n\nSome part of Sanders’s proposals and even his vision for this country may indeed be a fairy tale. But in the 2008 race, Bill Clinton criticized Obama and his position on the Iraq war as a “fairy tale.” Well fairy tales sometimes come true, particularly when Hillary Clinton stumbles.","gunning_fog_2":"11.2","flesch_2":"11.1","readability_2":"56.59","index_3":"57","title_3":"Cruz's 2016 strategy focuses on turning out white voters","url_3":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-02-05-US--GOP%202016-Cruz-White%20Turnout/id-b92587c622404c15b18976ec822c1a91","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"the Associated Press","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"(AP)  Ted Cruz has mapped out a path to the White House that all but ignores the explosion of minority voters in America.\nThe Texas senator's general election strategy depends almost wholly upon maximizing turnout among millions of conservative white voters  mostly evangelical Christians and the white working class  who didn't participate in the last presidential contest.\nAt the same time, Cruz's team is banking on a sharp decline in black and Hispanic support for the 2016 Democratic nominee, whoever it is, returning to voter trends before Barack Obama shook up the electorate as the nation's first black president and won an overwhelming share of support from non-white voters.\nIt is a strategy that defies the conventional wisdom in the GOP that says the party can win the White House again only if it appeals to political moderates and non-white voters who are becoming a greater share of the voting-age population as each day passes.\n\"I'm an outlier,\" said longtime Cruz aide Jason Johnson, the chief architect of the Cruz playbook, which he concedes is not in line with modern-day Republican thinking.\nYet with overwhelming confidence born from a year of studying voter trends, Johnson insists the first-term Texas senator can win the general election by motivating a coalition of his party's most reliable supporters.\n\"It is absolutely the case that in 2012, there were a little over 2 million fewer white non-Hispanics that voted compared to 2008,\" Johnson said this week in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They sat it out.\"\nThe strategy will not be tested unless Cruz survives the long road ahead in his party's hotly contested nomination process to represent the GOP in November's general election. Still, general election viability has emerged as a major theme in the days leading up to New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary among the leading Republican candidates.\nMany Washington Republicans warn that Cruz is simply too conservative to appeal to the wide swath of voters that typically decide general elections.\n\"They are just wrong about this,\" said Republican operative Matthew Dowd, who served as the chief political strategist for George W. Bush. \"It is about both motivation and persuasion. You can't motivate your base and at same time turn off moderates and independents.\"\nBut Cruz this week repeatedly declared that his team assembled a coalition in Iowa that would translate into general election success.\n\"We saw conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats all coming together,\" he said during a town hall-style meeting at a Portsmouth Toyota dealership. \"If we're going to win, if we're going to win the nomination and we're going to win the general election, we've got to bring that coalition together.\"\n\"That's what it's going to take to win the general election,\" he said.\nThe Cruz strategy is born by necessity.\nWhile his team notes he won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 2012 Senate election in Texas, and Cruz has the potential to become the nation's first Hispanic president, hardline conservative rhetoric on illegal immigration has defined his short political career. He has promoted endorsements from far-right conservatives such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, Cruz's national campaign co-chairman who has compared immigrants in the country illegally to drug mules and livestock.\nGOP leaders commissioned an exhaustive report after the 2012 elections calling for candidates to adopt more welcoming tones on immigration. But a hardline stance on immigration remains popular among white voters across America who make up the majority  albeit a shrinking majority  of the voting-age population and tend to vote Republican.\nTrump's sustained popularity is based in part on such anti-immigrant rhetoric. And more than 60 percent of Republicans polled by CNN last summer said the U.S. government should focus on stopping the flow of immigrants in the country illegally and deporting those already here. About 30 percent of Democrats said the same.\nJohnson, Cruz's top strategist, believes that Cruz can win in November even if he earns only 30 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally  a modest increase from Mitt Romney's 27 percent four years ago. And among black voters, Johnson envisions Cruz winning over roughly 10 percent, which is in line with the GOP's performance in 2000 and 2004.\nCruz has no plans to back off his hardline stance on immigration. His team has determined there is no evidence that immigration policy alone is a major factor win winning over Hispanic voters.\n\"It's not a panacea,\" Johnson said of immigration reform, citing internal and public polling. \"Even if we had to do better than 30 percent, that wouldn't do it.\"\nYet the country's demographic shifts have prompted some Republicans to reach the opposite conclusion and work harder to appeal to non-white voters, who by 2052 will make up a majority of the eligible voting-age population, according to a study by conducted last year by Washington think tanks representing both parties.\nGOP leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and recently departed presidential candidate Rand Paul have spoken extensively about poverty alleviation and criminal justice reform  issues that particularly resonate among black and Hispanic voters.\nThe share of all voters nationwide who are white has dropped consistently since 1996, according to census data. Even 2004, a year in which the total number of white voters increased by more than 10 million, failed to reverse that trend.\nYet Cruz's team is correct to note that millions of white voters sat out the 2012 elections. Census voting data shows about 2 million fewer white voters cast ballots in 2012 than 2008  the only time since 1996 that the total number of votes cast by a racial group has decreased from one presidential election to the next.\nSome Republican strategists, including Dowd, suggest the missing voters are concentrated in states that aren't likely to be contested in the general election.

But on the screen, portraits of scores of different faces appear and disappear in a blink. Many are ripped in half, as if to illustrate the danger of divisive politics. Old snapshots of families of every possible background flash by. Finally, the two halves of unrelated people’s portraits are merged, to signal the strength that comes from uniting people despite their differences.\n\nAdding to its power is the ad’s back story: It was submitted by supporters of Mr. Sanders and chosen by curators of such content in an effort overseen by his wife, Jane. In a sense, then, others are already taking up the banner of the revolution Mr. Sanders is trying to foment.\n\nThat revolution is possible only with the broadest popular support. “Our job is not to divide,” Mr. Sanders shouts. “Our job is to bring people together.” It does not hurt that this message of unity is well timed, as Mr. Sanders seeks to expand his appeal among blacks in South Carolina, Latinos in Nevada and other constituencies as his primary battle with Hillary Clinton expands nationally.\n\nThe spot began its life as a short video, shown on a big screen before the band Vampire Weekend performed an acoustic set at a Sanders campaign rally in Iowa City. The crowd erupted as the video reached its conclusion. Since then it has gone viral, earning millions of views and comparisons to President Obama’s 2008 “Yes We Can” ad. Seeing the video’s popularity, the campaign bought the ad on Friday and said it would begin airing it this week.\n\nElection contests are, by their nature, divisive. But amid the testy debates and stump speech sniping, this ad reminds viewers that the campaign is ultimately about everyone — a rare injection of togetherness when the nation is being coldly deconstructed by candidates and their strategists into a jigsaw puzzle in either red or blue.\n\nChanging channels ...\n\nSenator Ted Cruz’s campaign did not know it at the time, but the actress hired to deliver the money line in a negative ad against Senator Marco Rubio — calling him “just a pretty face” — had starred in soft-core pornographic films.

Trump’s most boorish moments, portraying Mr. Trump as a coward and Mr. Bush as “the better man.” At the end, it cut to the comically awkward entrances of the candidates at the last debate: With Mr. Trump oddly waiting in the wings with Ben Carson, Mr. Bush emerges from behind them, pats Mr. Trump on the shoulder, then cocks an eyebrow and smirks as he strides by, never looking back.\n\nA 1992 hip-hop song, “Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta,” found immortality on the soundtrack of the cult-favorite film “Office Space” in 1999. Mr. Cruz’s campaign, continuing a string of satirical ads, spoofed the song in a spot mocking Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. “Damn it feels good to be a Clinton,” the lyrics say.\n\n$30 million: The amount spent on negative ads broadcast on New Hampshire television stations over the past year by presidential candidates and their allies.\n\n$27 million: The amount spent on negative ads nationwide by Right to Rise alone.","gunning_fog_4":"8.0","flesch_4":"6.8","readability_4":"73.17","index_5":"103","title_5":"Really, Donald Trump? A fight with the Pope?","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/opinions/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-dantonio/index.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n (CNN)  Donald Trump once told me, \"I always loved to fight.\"  But even those of us who know him and his fighting mentality have to marvel at his ability to find new battles. I mean really, Donald, you're going to argue with the Pope? About Christianity?\nTo be fair, from the Trumpian viewpoint, Pope Francis sort of started it. He decided to make a pilgrimage to Mexico and to include a visit to the border where Trump proposes to build a huge wall to keep people out. A champion of the poor and the suffering, Francis has visited slums all over the world and washed the feet of homeless men and women. \nBut for Trump, the trip to Mexico, where just about everyone is Catholic and about half the population lives in poverty, was a step too far.    \n\"I think that the Pope is a very political person,\" Trump said in a TV interview last week. \nHe then wondered whether maybe Francis was a pawn of the Mexican government. \"I don't think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico,\" said Trump. \"I think Mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is. They're making a fortune, and we're losing.\"\nTrump's pre-emptive strike, made before the Pope even left Rome, was a play for votes in South Carolina, where religious tradition includes longstanding suspicions about the Catholic Church.  Criticizing the Pope also gave Trump yet another turn in the media spotlight, which is a place he finds quite comfortable. \nBesides, who else was the fighter going to tangle with? \nHis Republican opponents seem incapable of giving Trump a real contest, and nobody in the news media was causing him to sweat. Trump was probably getting bored. Thanks to Francis, he's not bored now.\nThough as different from Trump as love is from anger, Francis is similar to him in one way: He says what he thinks. Early in his papacy, he shocked fellow Catholics when reporters asked him about homosexuality -- a subject long anathema to the Vatican -- and he answered, \"Who am I to judge?\" \nWhen told of Trump's criticisms as he flew home from Mexico on Thursday, the Pope said, \"Thank God he said I am a political man. Because Aristotle defines a human being as a political animal: At least I am a human being. Am I a pawn? Well maybe. I will leave that up to your judgment. And a person who only thinks about making wall, wherever it may be, and not building bridges, is not a Christian.\" \nLike Trump, the Pope does not speak without purpose. \nHe has doubtlessly followed the American presidential campaign more closely that Trump has followed the news from the Vatican. And just as Trump fights to win whatever prize he has in mind, the Pope has fought doggedly on behalf of the poor.\nHe has criticized world leaders for failing to lift-up humanity, and he has chastised leaders of his own Church for living lavishly while members of their flocks suffer.  His Christianity is defined by the Jesus who threw the money changers out of the temple. \nIn his own effort to be Christian, he aligns himself with refugees and victims of drug trafficking and has expressed that he would err on the side of open arms and open borders.  This has been his response to the refugee crisis in Europe. Is it any wonder he would criticize Trump's plan mass deportations and massive wall? \nIn this latest controversy, Trump, has followed his usual strategy of keeping up the fight, no matter what.\nHe answered the Pope by saying: \"He doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation\" and complaining that \"for a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. ... No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn, and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.\" \nOf course, Francis considers Christianity his area of expertise in the same way that Trump imagines that money and power are his. And he is less inclined than Trump to be shy about stating his beliefs. When he celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus, last December, he offered a very un-Trumpian homily that included this:\n\"In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this Child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential. ... Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy, drawn daily from the wellspring of prayer.\"\nMaybe Trump heard the Christmas homily and took it personally. Maybe he understood that the Pontiff -- Latin for bridge-builder -- would join the battle of ideas. \nCertainly Francis is not likely to back down. He is as transformational for the church as Trump is in politics. Humble and empathetic, he might apologize for hurting Trump's feelings. But he won't abandon his position. He will always prefer bridges to walls. \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.\n","gunning_fog_5":"8.8","flesch_5":"8.7","readability_5":"62.68","gold_title":" This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest","gold_url":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The Guardian","gold_body":"t’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}},{"id":1952862282,"created_at":"2016-04-08T00:05:07+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-07T23:56:12+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"fusioncash","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"KY","city":"Owensboro","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915123,"worker_id":35242242,"trust":0.6875,"worker_trust":0.96875,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"1","q2":"1","q3":"-1","q4":"1","q5":"-1","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"1","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"17","index_1":"55","title_1":"Ted Cruz tries to seize Rand Paul's libertarian mantle","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/ted-cruz-new-hampshire-rand-paul/index.html","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"Goffstown, New Hampshire (CNN)  Ted Cruz isn't in Iowa anymore. \nGone Wednesday morning was the vow to investigate Planned Parenthood. In was the punch line about the White House tapping your cell phone. \nThe Texas senator, who barnstormed Iowa with a preacher's pitch that carried him to victory Monday, unveiled a new stump speech here that signaled a new profile he will try to build as a government-fearing, gun-hugging outsider who will protect New Hampshire from the evils of Washington. \nMaking things easier Wednesday: Rand Paul quit the race. \nWinning libertarian voters has been a centerpiece of the New Hampshire strategy for Cruz, who has flirted with the GOP's libertarian views on foreign policy. Cruz has argued that he is the natural inheritor of the modern libertarian movement built by Ron Paul, which was especially resonant here in New Hampshire, where the elder Paul won second place four years ago. And now, with his son's decision to drop out, Cruz's best path to a strong showing in the bunched GOP field here could be to dominate -- no longer split -- that group of Republicans. \n\"There are a whole bunch of areas that the federal government has no business sticking its nose in,\" Cruz said to hollers here in Hooksett. \"I will fight every day for you, for your freedom, for your right to run a small business, for economic growth and for keeping government the heck off your back.\"\nCruz's entreaties appear to be paying off. A number of state legislators -- in places ranging from here in New Hampshire to the Paul family's Texas -- signed onto the Cruz team. \nOne major Republican megadonor, who had been one of the biggest backers of pro-Paul super PACs, Silicon Valley titan Scott Banister, pledged on Wednesday to Cruz as well -- though he said he has not yet decided to give to a Cruz super PAC. \n\"I've interviewed Ted, and while we don't agree on every issue, I believe he's one of us,\" Banister said in an email to CNN, \"and libertarians will discover that.\" \nCruz's team at the outset of the campaign saw Paul as a top rival for libertarian-minded voters. But as Paul's campaign lagged amid poor fundraising and diminished national support, Cruz meticulously moved onto his turf, sharing libertarian-targeted videos before some Cruz rallies and working behind the scenes to poach several of the Paul family's most loyal activists. \nAnd on Wednesday, Cruz offered a new speech that seemed tailor-made for this state's Republican identity. The Texan still quoted Scripture, but his Christian messaging centered more on a federal lawsuit against a Catholic charity than it did in Iowa. He still called for American leadership in the world, but foreign policy on the whole was giving shorter shrift than it has been for months. \n\"New England was meant to be the new England, the new land,\" he told the crowd in Henniker on Wednesday morning, \"where we could come and be free and not have government dictate our faith, dictate our lives.\" \nAnd Cruz had several opportunities to appeal directly to the Paul family's network, and he appeared eager to do so. After Cruz finished a media availability here almost entirely about the latest attacks from Donald Trump, Cruz walked away -- but then in a rare display for the disciplined candidate, turned around and returned to reporters when asked a shouted question if he had any reaction to Rand's departure. \n\"He and I have been side by side in a great many fights in the U.S. Senate, standing for liberty,\" Cruz told reporters. \"They worked very, very hard.\" \nCruz's new talking points across the southern part of the state on Wednesday scratched the five things he'd do on the first day in office -- moving to U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, looking into the controversial Planned Parenthood videos -- and instead emphasized a more Granite State-hued pitch: celebrating the Second Amendment, sounding the alarm on abuse of eminent domain. \nIn a state like New Hampshire, Cruz's team is betting that pays off. His aides are increasingly optimistic about their fortunes in the state after his momentum from Iowa. But their broader New Hampshire goal -- to bury Marco Rubio beneath less well-funded candidates like John Kasich and Chris Christie -- has become a taller task after Rubio notched a stronger-than-expected third-place showing. \nBut true libertarians say Cruz isn't dyed-in-the-wool enough. At a tavern here in Hillsborough County, Cruz received two separate questions from friends who identified as Rand Paul supporters until Wednesday morning -- and neither felt Cruz did enough to align himself with the movement. \nLeah Wolczko, a 49-year-old state employee, said Cruz was too hawkish on foreign policy and the use of military force by the president. \n\"It's the militancy that gets my hesitation,\" she said, only concluding that Cruz's alignment with the movement was \"okay.\"\nBut he might be the best they've got. Ryan Milner, asked which presidential candidate might be better than Cruz for the movement, came up with a man whose time had passed: \"Ron Paul.\"","gunning_fog_1":"11.2","flesch_1":"11.1","readability_1":"56.59","index_2":"79","title_2":"Op-Ed Columnist: Hillary Clinton Stumbles","url_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/opinion/hillary-clinton-stumbles.html","candidate_2":"Hillary Clinton","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Campaign Finance","body_2":"In October, when Hillary Clinton made a spectacle of the congressional Benghazi committee during a marathon interrogation that seemed designed to make a spectacle of her, she emerged stronger than ever. Her polls numbers surged.\n\nThat performance had come on the heels of a strong debate performance the week before in the first Democratic presidential debate.\n\nShe had bolstered the image she wanted to project: strong, smart, capable and battle-tested.\n\nBut now, on the verge of Monday night’s Democratic town hall in Iowa — the last time the candidates will face off before the caucuses in that state — and with Bernie Sanders’s poll numbers climbing not only in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign seems increasingly desperate and reckless.\n\nI noticed the turn in the last debate as Clinton seemed to me to go too far in her attacks on Sanders, while simultaneously painting herself into a box that will be very hard to escape.\n\nShe wrapped herself in President Obama’s legacy so tightly that she could hardly breathe, and then built an image of herself as a practical politician who could build on Obama’s accomplishments by taking small steps and negotiating tough deals.\n\nBut practicality and incrementalism, as reasonable as that strategy and persona may be, are simply no match for what animates the Sanders campaign — a kind of kinetic, even if sometimes overblown, idealism. His is a passionate exposition of liberalism — and yes, democratic socialism — in its most positive light.\n\nBut, let me be clear and unequivocal: I find his earnest philosophic positions to be clear and often laudable, but also somewhat quixotic. I think that he is promising far more than even he knows he can deliver, and the electability question is still a real one, even though polls now show him matching up well against possible Republican opponents.\n\nFor instance, Sanders’s plan for universal health care is an admirable ambition of any true liberal, but as presented seems to me unworkable, and the prospect of getting it passed through this Congress or any Congress that vaguely resembles it is nil. Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare, which is far shy of Sanders’s proposal, more than 60 times. Suggesting that it would pass something even more expansive is mere fantasy.\n\nWhen Sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a “political revolution,” which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the Senate and possibly the House.\n\nInteresting, but also unlikely. Go talk to all the Blue Dog Democrats who lost their seats in the wake of Obamacare passage. Go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. Go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure Republican leadership, and therefore prevent Medicaid from being expanded in their states.\n\nThere are political realities that exist in America that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.\n\nFurthermore, Sanders likes to tout that he doesn’t have a “super PAC” and doesn’t want one. That is a principled position. But the Republican candidate will have the support of many super PACs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the Republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. They are going to beat Sanders like a he is a nail with the “socialist” label and his proposal on new taxation. Middle of the spectrum Middle America is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.\n\nBut instead of Clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than Sanders’s, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about Sanders’s honor.\n\nThe swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-Obama because he wanted Obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap Obamacare, simply do not connect.\n\nSanders may be a dreamer, but he’s not dishonorable. Trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.\n\nThere are a tremendous number of echoes starting to be heard between the way Clinton ran against Obama, and the way she is running against Sanders.\n\nClinton has what political insiders call the “firewall”: Overwhelming support among black and Hispanic voters in Southern and some Western states. But a win by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could supply a boost of momentum that could greatly erode the Clinton firewall.\n\nIf Clinton can’t find a positive, energetic message to project, and soon, she is going to be swept away by Sanders.\n\nSome part of Sanders’s proposals and even his vision for this country may indeed be a fairy tale. But in the 2008 race, Bill Clinton criticized Obama and his position on the Iraq war as a “fairy tale.” Well fairy tales sometimes come true, particularly when Hillary Clinton stumbles.","gunning_fog_2":"11.2","flesch_2":"11.1","readability_2":"56.59","index_3":"57","title_3":"Cruz's 2016 strategy focuses on turning out white voters","url_3":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-02-05-US--GOP%202016-Cruz-White%20Turnout/id-b92587c622404c15b18976ec822c1a91","candidate_3":"Ted Cruz","org_3":"the Associated Press","top_topic_3":"Immigration","body_3":"(AP)  Ted Cruz has mapped out a path to the White House that all but ignores the explosion of minority voters in America.\nThe Texas senator's general election strategy depends almost wholly upon maximizing turnout among millions of conservative white voters  mostly evangelical Christians and the white working class  who didn't participate in the last presidential contest.\nAt the same time, Cruz's team is banking on a sharp decline in black and Hispanic support for the 2016 Democratic nominee, whoever it is, returning to voter trends before Barack Obama shook up the electorate as the nation's first black president and won an overwhelming share of support from non-white voters.\nIt is a strategy that defies the conventional wisdom in the GOP that says the party can win the White House again only if it appeals to political moderates and non-white voters who are becoming a greater share of the voting-age population as each day passes.\n\"I'm an outlier,\" said longtime Cruz aide Jason Johnson, the chief architect of the Cruz playbook, which he concedes is not in line with modern-day Republican thinking.\nYet with overwhelming confidence born from a year of studying voter trends, Johnson insists the first-term Texas senator can win the general election by motivating a coalition of his party's most reliable supporters.\n\"It is absolutely the case that in 2012, there were a little over 2 million fewer white non-Hispanics that voted compared to 2008,\" Johnson said this week in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They sat it out.\"\nThe strategy will not be tested unless Cruz survives the long road ahead in his party's hotly contested nomination process to represent the GOP in November's general election. Still, general election viability has emerged as a major theme in the days leading up to New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary among the leading Republican candidates.\nMany Washington Republicans warn that Cruz is simply too conservative to appeal to the wide swath of voters that typically decide general elections.\n\"They are just wrong about this,\" said Republican operative Matthew Dowd, who served as the chief political strategist for George W. Bush. \"It is about both motivation and persuasion. You can't motivate your base and at same time turn off moderates and independents.\"\nBut Cruz this week repeatedly declared that his team assembled a coalition in Iowa that would translate into general election success.\n\"We saw conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats all coming together,\" he said during a town hall-style meeting at a Portsmouth Toyota dealership. \"If we're going to win, if we're going to win the nomination and we're going to win the general election, we've got to bring that coalition together.\"\n\"That's what it's going to take to win the general election,\" he said.\nThe Cruz strategy is born by necessity.\nWhile his team notes he won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 2012 Senate election in Texas, and Cruz has the potential to become the nation's first Hispanic president, hardline conservative rhetoric on illegal immigration has defined his short political career. He has promoted endorsements from far-right conservatives such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, Cruz's national campaign co-chairman who has compared immigrants in the country illegally to drug mules and livestock.\nGOP leaders commissioned an exhaustive report after the 2012 elections calling for candidates to adopt more welcoming tones on immigration. But a hardline stance on immigration remains popular among white voters across America who make up the majority  albeit a shrinking majority  of the voting-age population and tend to vote Republican.\nTrump's sustained popularity is based in part on such anti-immigrant rhetoric. And more than 60 percent of Republicans polled by CNN last summer said the U.S. government should focus on stopping the flow of immigrants in the country illegally and deporting those already here. About 30 percent of Democrats said the same.\nJohnson, Cruz's top strategist, believes that Cruz can win in November even if he earns only 30 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally  a modest increase from Mitt Romney's 27 percent four years ago. And among black voters, Johnson envisions Cruz winning over roughly 10 percent, which is in line with the GOP's performance in 2000 and 2004.\nCruz has no plans to back off his hardline stance on immigration. His team has determined there is no evidence that immigration policy alone is a major factor win winning over Hispanic voters.\n\"It's not a panacea,\" Johnson said of immigration reform, citing internal and public polling. \"Even if we had to do better than 30 percent, that wouldn't do it.\"\nYet the country's demographic shifts have prompted some Republicans to reach the opposite conclusion and work harder to appeal to non-white voters, who by 2052 will make up a majority of the eligible voting-age population, according to a study by conducted last year by Washington think tanks representing both parties.\nGOP leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and recently departed presidential candidate Rand Paul have spoken extensively about poverty alleviation and criminal justice reform  issues that particularly resonate among black and Hispanic voters.\nThe share of all voters nationwide who are white has dropped consistently since 1996, according to census data. Even 2004, a year in which the total number of white voters increased by more than 10 million, failed to reverse that trend.\nYet Cruz's team is correct to note that millions of white voters sat out the 2012 elections. Census voting data shows about 2 million fewer white voters cast ballots in 2012 than 2008  the only time since 1996 that the total number of votes cast by a racial group has decreased from one presidential election to the next.\nSome Republican strategists, including Dowd, suggest the missing voters are concentrated in states that aren't likely to be contested in the general election. They argue that even if Cruz gets them to vote, they won't improve his November prospects.\nCruz's team won't ignore minority voters altogether. The campaign has an African-American outreach director, and Cruz this week promised to campaign in Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods at some point. His major challenge is to drive white turnout while not completely alienating minorities.\n\"You can't just go out and throw red meat on the table just because you know it will help turnout on one side of the equation,\" he said. \"We're either right or wrong.\"\n___\nAssociated Press News Survey Specialist Emily Swanson contributed to this report from Washington.\n___\nFollow Steve Peoples on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/sppeoples","gunning_fog_3":"10.4","flesch_3":"11.5","readability_3":"50.16","index_4":"2","title_4":"Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders Relies on Supporters for Ad About Unity","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/politics/bernie-sanders-relies-on-supporters-for-ad-about-unity.html","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"After letting Simon and Garfunkel speak for him in one ad, Senator Bernie Sanders has turned over his latest to his supporters, several of whom created a 60-second spot titled “Together.”\n\nOnly Mr. Sanders’s voice is heard, delivering a clarion call to unite Americans across every conceivable demographic line. But on the screen, portraits of scores of different faces appear and disappear in a blink. Many are ripped in half, as if to illustrate the danger of divisive politics. Old snapshots of families of every possible background flash by. Finally, the two halves of unrelated people’s portraits are merged, to signal the strength that comes from uniting people despite their differences.\n\nAdding to its power is the ad’s back story: It was submitted by supporters of Mr. Sanders and chosen by curators of such content in an effort overseen by his wife, Jane. In a sense, then, others are already taking up the banner of the revolution Mr. Sanders is trying to foment.\n\nThat revolution is possible only with the broadest popular support. “Our job is not to divide,” Mr. Sanders shouts. “Our job is to bring people together.” It does not hurt that this message of unity is well timed, as Mr. Sanders seeks to expand his appeal among blacks in South Carolina, Latinos in Nevada and other constituencies as his primary battle with Hillary Clinton expands nationally.\n\nThe spot began its life as a short video, shown on a big screen before the band Vampire Weekend performed an acoustic set at a Sanders campaign rally in Iowa City. The crowd erupted as the video reached its conclusion. Since then it has gone viral, earning millions of views and comparisons to President Obama’s 2008 “Yes We Can” ad. Seeing the video’s popularity, the campaign bought the ad on Friday and said it would begin airing it this week.\n\nElection contests are, by their nature, divisive. But amid the testy debates and stump speech sniping, this ad reminds viewers that the campaign is ultimately about everyone — a rare injection of togetherness when the nation is being coldly deconstructed by candidates and their strategists into a jigsaw puzzle in either red or blue.\n\nChanging channels ...\n\nSenator Ted Cruz’s campaign did not know it at the time, but the actress hired to deliver the money line in a negative ad against Senator Marco Rubio — calling him “just a pretty face” — had starred in soft-core pornographic films.

Trump’s most boorish moments, portraying Mr. Trump as a coward and Mr. Bush as “the better man.” At the end, it cut to the comically awkward entrances of the candidates at the last debate: With Mr. Trump oddly waiting in the wings with Ben Carson, Mr. Bush emerges from behind them, pats Mr. Trump on the shoulder, then cocks an eyebrow and smirks as he strides by, never looking back.\n\nA 1992 hip-hop song, “Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta,” found immortality on the soundtrack of the cult-favorite film “Office Space” in 1999. Mr. Cruz’s campaign, continuing a string of satirical ads, spoofed the song in a spot mocking Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. “Damn it feels good to be a Clinton,” the lyrics say.\n\n$30 million: The amount spent on negative ads broadcast on New Hampshire television stations over the past year by presidential candidates and their allies.\n\n$27 million: The amount spent on negative ads nationwide by Right to Rise alone.","gunning_fog_4":"8.0","flesch_4":"6.8","readability_4":"73.17","index_5":"103","title_5":"Really, Donald Trump? A fight with the Pope?","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/opinions/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-dantonio/index.html","candidate_5":"Donald Trump","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n (CNN)  Donald Trump once told me, \"I always loved to fight.\"  But even those of us who know him and his fighting mentality have to marvel at his ability to find new battles. I mean really, Donald, you're going to argue with the Pope? About Christianity?\nTo be fair, from the Trumpian viewpoint, Pope Francis sort of started it. He decided to make a pilgrimage to Mexico and to include a visit to the border where Trump proposes to build a huge wall to keep people out. A champion of the poor and the suffering, Francis has visited slums all over the world and washed the feet of homeless men and women. \nBut for Trump, the trip to Mexico, where just about everyone is Catholic and about half the population lives in poverty, was a step too far.    \n\"I think that the Pope is a very political person,\" Trump said in a TV interview last week. \nHe then wondered whether maybe Francis was a pawn of the Mexican government. \"I don't think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico,\" said Trump. \"I think Mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is. They're making a fortune, and we're losing.\"\nTrump's pre-emptive strike, made before the Pope even left Rome, was a play for votes in South Carolina, where religious tradition includes longstanding suspicions about the Catholic Church.  Criticizing the Pope also gave Trump yet another turn in the media spotlight, which is a place he finds quite comfortable. \nBesides, who else was the fighter going to tangle with? \nHis Republican opponents seem incapable of giving Trump a real contest, and nobody in the news media was causing him to sweat. Trump was probably getting bored. Thanks to Francis, he's not bored now.\nThough as different from Trump as love is from anger, Francis is similar to him in one way: He says what he thinks. Early in his papacy, he shocked fellow Catholics when reporters asked him about homosexuality -- a subject long anathema to the Vatican -- and he answered, \"Who am I to judge?\" \nWhen told of Trump's criticisms as he flew home from Mexico on Thursday, the Pope said, \"Thank God he said I am a political man. Because Aristotle defines a human being as a political animal: At least I am a human being. Am I a pawn? Well maybe. I will leave that up to your judgment. And a person who only thinks about making wall, wherever it may be, and not building bridges, is not a Christian.\" \nLike Trump, the Pope does not speak without purpose. \nHe has doubtlessly followed the American presidential campaign more closely that Trump has followed the news from the Vatican. And just as Trump fights to win whatever prize he has in mind, the Pope has fought doggedly on behalf of the poor.\nHe has criticized world leaders for failing to lift-up humanity, and he has chastised leaders of his own Church for living lavishly while members of their flocks suffer.  His Christianity is defined by the Jesus who threw the money changers out of the temple. \nIn his own effort to be Christian, he aligns himself with refugees and victims of drug trafficking and has expressed that he would err on the side of open arms and open borders.  This has been his response to the refugee crisis in Europe. Is it any wonder he would criticize Trump's plan mass deportations and massive wall? \nIn this latest controversy, Trump, has followed his usual strategy of keeping up the fight, no matter what.\nHe answered the Pope by saying: \"He doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation\" and complaining that \"for a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. ... No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn, and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.\" \nOf course, Francis considers Christianity his area of expertise in the same way that Trump imagines that money and power are his. And he is less inclined than Trump to be shy about stating his beliefs. When he celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus, last December, he offered a very un-Trumpian homily that included this:\n\"In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this Child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential. ... Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy, drawn daily from the wellspring of prayer.\"\nMaybe Trump heard the Christmas homily and took it personally. Maybe he understood that the Pontiff -- Latin for bridge-builder -- would join the battle of ideas. \nCertainly Francis is not likely to back down. He is as transformational for the church as Trump is in politics. Humble and empathetic, he might apologize for hurting Trump's feelings. But he won't abandon his position. He will always prefer bridges to walls. \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.\n","gunning_fog_5":"8.8","flesch_5":"8.7","readability_5":"62.68","gold_title":" This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest","gold_url":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The Guardian","gold_body":"t’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5897435897435898},"q1":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.717948717948718},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q3":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q4":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q5":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.5897435897435898},"q6":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q7":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6923076923076923},"q8":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.41025641025641024},"q9":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q10":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5897435897435898},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"female","confidence":0.5897435897435898},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"5064","confidence":0.717948717948718},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"republican","confidence":0.41025641025641024},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"john_kasich","confidence":0.41025641025641024}}}

All told, the group has raised almost $51 million in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nIn addition to the money raised, donors have committed to providing at least $42 million in additional contributions, officials said. Those pledges would allow the group to exceed its total fund-raising for the 2012 cycle, when Priorities was formed to help President Obama win re-election. As of Friday, the group had almost $45 million in cash on hand.\n\n“We have raised significantly more resources than at this point in 2012, built a team of our Party’s strongest leaders and activists, and are developing cutting-edge strategies to reach Democratic and undecided voters in every battleground state,” Guy Cecil, the group’s co-chairman, said in a memorandum obtained by The New York Times.\n\nWhile full details of Priorities’ fund-raising will not be available until the super PAC files its official fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission this weekend, Mr. Cecil’s memorandum said the group had raised money from several labor unions that are backing Mrs. Clinton, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Laborers’ International Union of North America.\n\nA person with knowledge of the group’s fund-raising said the organization had also secured large donations or commitments from a number of wealthy individuals, including James Simons, a New York hedge fund founder, and Danny Abraham, a Florida entrepreneur.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton remains locked in the polls with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire, Priorities has so far banked most of its money for an expected general election campaign. The group’s spending for the 2016 cycle includes just $444,961 on independent expenditures as of Friday, most of it defending Mrs. Clinton from Republican attacks or promoting Mrs. Clinton’s positions.","gunning_fog_1":"12.0","flesch_1":"13.0","readability_1":"46.1","index_2":"104","title_2":"Taking Note: Trump vs. Pope, Round 2","url_2":"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/trump-vs-pope-round-2/","candidate_2":"Donald Trump","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"The headlines are blazing, Twitter is lit up, the political press is all hot for the kind of story it loves to tell: two huge celebrities attacking each other.\n\nMy first impulse on hearing that Pope Francis was calling out Donald Trump personally for his noxious views about immigrants and border walls was to quietly rest my head on my keyboard. It’s always wonderful to see a bully confronted — the bigger the bully, the better — but it was hard to see any good coming of this. Personal attacks are Mr. Trump’s weapon of choice, not the Pope’s, and anyone could have predicted what happened next: Trump struck back with indignant fury, and his people revenge-tweeted about the walls surrounding Vatican City.\n\nFor solace and perspective, I went to find out what America, the level-headed Jesuit magazine, was saying. Its article has a slightly longer quotation than The Times has (italics added): “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.”\n\nThat is an important line. Pope Francis leads the universal Catholic Church, so he is a pretty good authority on what is or is not in the Gospel — the New Testament, the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nOdds are you have a pretty good idea yourself, at least enough to spot which of these two sets of quotations is bona-fide scripture.\n\nA.\n\n“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”\n\n“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.”\n\n“I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”\n\nB.\n\n“They’re bringing crime. They’re bringing drugs. They’re rapists.”\n\n“These are people that shouldn’t be in our country. They flow in like water.”\n\n“Nobody can build a fence like me.”\n\nScripture-quoting is a tricky proposition; show any Bible-thumper a passage to prove a point and he will immediately thump you back with something seemingly contradictory.\n\nBut it’s fair to say that the core of Christian teaching is not “Don’t be a loser.” It’s “Love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\nI have little expectation that today’s episode will lead to any enlightening discussion. But I can at least pray that it might lead to more challenging, probing questioning of the candidates — the Republicans, I mean, who are so quick to lead with their Christian faith, and to summon the blessings of God upon their political endeavors.\n\nBecause there is so much dissonance when the G.O.P. does its holy-rolling thing. There are so many questions.\n\nHow can Ted Cruz begin a rally by invoking the Lord, and then speak as though he is running for war criminal? What do his Christian audiences think when he calls for the indiscriminate bombing of Muslim civilians, and laughs about making sand “glow in the dark” — basically a joke about mass murder?\n\nWhy does someone like Marco Rubio tell heart-warming stories about his immigrant roots, and then, with equal conviction, insist that he will pull up the ladder for more recent, non-qualified immigrant families, the ones his primary voters hate and fear?\n\nWhy has the entire Republican field treated immigrants and refugees, even dead Syrian children washed ashore on a beach, not as victims deserving welcome, but as threats to be shunned?\n\nWhy are immigrants who cross burning deserts to provide for their children, who stand on street corners to take any available job, but not handouts, who embody Republican ideals of faith and family, so hated by the God-and-country crowd?\n\nWhy, with their strong faith and the full might of America to protect them, do the Republican candidates sound so frightened and angry?\n\nA Christian, by definition, believes Jesus is God, who dwelled among us, who was born poor, who preached a Gospel of love, and — though he surely could have annihilated the Romans and blasted his persecutors and made the sands of Galilee glow in the dark — allowed himself to be put to death by the authorities.\n\nWhy is that peaceful Christ never present in Republican speeches?\n\nA Christian is also someone who sees the essential dignity and worth of other human beings. That would have to include immigrants and refugees, those who live and work here without papers, or who are trying to migrate to the United States, who are uprooted by poverty and war. Those who are being murdered by drug traffickers. Who are victims of crime. Who are raped.\n\nI’ll give the last words to Gerard Manley Hopkins, the Victorian poet with the radical style who was a Jesuit, like Pope Francis, and who wrote vividly about God’s presence in the world — and in the people — around us:\n\nI say more: the just man justices;\nKeeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;\nActs in God’s eye what in God’s eye he is –\nChrist – for Christ plays in ten thousand places,\nLovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his\nTo the Father through the features of men’s faces.","gunning_fog_2":"10.0","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"68.1","index_3":"13","title_3":"Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders and Fans Embrace Tune of ‘America’ in Ad Free of Attacks","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-and-fans-embrace-tune-of-america-in-ad-free-of-attacks.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"For a blissful minute, the cacophony of political ads on Iowa television sets vanishes altogether. No speeches, no slurs, only the warm harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel singing “America” can be heard, as down-to-earth Iowa landscapes and scenes of daily life accompany the famous song, in a new ad from Senator Bernie Sanders with the same title.\n\nIowa farmers (including a small child not much bigger than the calf he carries) and city dwellers give way to mostly young people jubilantly flocking to attend his rallies. An expanding grid overtakes the screen, showing the faces of thousands of people who made online donations to Mr. Sanders’s campaign.\n\nA nontraditional offering from a decidedly nontraditional candidate, the ad earned a great deal of news coverage, without saying a word about Mr. Sanders, his platform or his chief opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe ad actually said plenty about how Mr. Sanders views the Democratic presidential contest. As politicians often say but seldom get across so viscerally, the election is ultimately about the voters. By turning over the microphone to Simon and Garfunkel, and aiming the camera not at Mr. Sanders so much as at Iowans generally and his admirers specifically, the ad tries to convey that “what Bernie Sanders is building is a movement in America,” explained Tad Devine, his senior strategist.\n\nThough the ad placed minorities front and center in several shots, David Brock, who runs Correct the Record, a Clinton-aligned group, said the many views of Mr. Sanders’s large crowds showed that his following was overwhelmingly white. “From this ad, it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Brock told The Associated Press. The statement received a harsh rebuke from the Sanders campaign, which recalled Mr. Brock’s early career as a conservative author, calling him a onetime “right-wing extremist.”\n\nThe ad, created by Devine Mulvey Longabaugh, has a vastly different feel from anything else seen in the race since Mrs. Clinton announced her candidacy in a hope-filled two-minute video in April 2015. It strikingly contrasts with Mrs. Clinton’s own minute-long closing argument to Iowans, replete with grave warnings and bold promises. And it is likely to stand out amid the clutter of attack ads and boasts from candidates and their allies in both parties.\n\nChanging channels…\n\nSenator Marco Rubio’s campaign is the first to turn a celebrity endorsement into a television ad, with Rick Harrison, the host of the reality show “Pawn Stars.” Saying he can detect a fraud, Mr. Harrison assures viewers: “When this guy walked into my shop, I knew he was the real deal.”\n\nMost presidential campaigns distill their national message into 30 seconds and plop it between newscasts in the early states. But the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz is focusing on a hyperlocal issue, with a spot that has the look and feel of an ad for a House candidate, not a leading presidential contender: promising to protect Fort Jackson in Columbia, S.C., from thousands of job cuts.\n\nRight to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, came up with an inventive way to make sure its 15-minute video was viewed: by putting it in the mail, not in the form of a DVD but with a video mailer. The mailers, with glossy screens the size of an iPad Mini, arrived in the mailboxes of supporters the campaign considers influential, and the video, the length of a documentary short, began to play as soon as the package was opened.\n\n41 different presidential advertisements ran on Tuesday alone in various markets.\n\n$22 MILLION has been spent in the campaign so far on advertising attacking Mr. Rubio.\n\n$4.8 MILLION in ad time has already been reserved by Right to Rise in Texas, where Republicans vote on March 1.","gunning_fog_3":"9.2","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"61.67","index_4":"73","title_4":"First Draft: Major Donors to Clinton Include Napster Co-Founder","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/14/major-donors-to-clinton-include-napster-co-founder/","candidate_4":"Hillary Clinton","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Sean Parker, the youthful billionaire and co-founder of the music-sharing service Napster, gave nearly $300,000 to a joint fund-raising committee for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and dozens of state Democratic parties, federal filings show. \n\nMr. Parker was one of several donors in recent months to give to the Hillary Victory Fund.

You can't make this up.\nFalwell's father and namesake was one of the architects of the Religious Right in the late 1970s, arguing that politically conservative evangelicals should be active in the pursuit of \"biblical values\" in the arena of politics. Although Falwell's politics were misguided -- he mobilized politically to defend the tax-exempt status of his own Liberty Christian Academy and other so-called segregation academies -- the elder Falwell, at times at least, upheld the pretense that his political agenda was shaped by the principles set forth in the Bible, even as he led evangelicals away from their historical concern for the poor, for women and minorities and into the maw of right-wing politics.\nHis son and successor as head of Liberty University has abandoned all pretense that biblical values inform his politics. The younger Falwell, however, is very much like his father in one crucial respect: He clearly is more interested in political influence than scriptural principles. \nIn his endorsement, Falwell Jr. did not anoint Trump as the most righteous candidate; that distinction would probably go to Bernie Sanders, a self-described secular Jew who calls out moneyed interests with the passion of the Hebrew prophets. Falwell, however, hailed Trump as \"a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.\" \nTrump is on his third marriage. Whether or not he qualifies as a \"wonderful father\" is not for me to judge, although he has eerily suggested that, were she not his daughter, he'd consider dating Ivanka Trump (his daughter). Similarly, in 1980, Jerry Falwell Sr., while proclaiming his support for \"family values,\" embraced the divorced and remarried Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter.\nAnd what about biblical values, which are supposed to be at the core of the Religious Right? Jesus was emphatic that his followers busy themselves with caring for people on the margins, a concern that does not appear to be animating the Trump campaign. Jesus described those who would be admitted into the kingdom of heaven as those who demonstrated acts of kindness toward people in need. Those gestures would be reckoned as though they were directed to Jesus himself: \"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\" \nJesus spent his entire earthly ministry with outcasts, healing the sick and the lame,while Trump regularly makes fun of people he labels \"losers.\"  Whereas Jesus was especially gracious toward children and women, Trump, on the other hand, derides women as \"pigs,\" \"dogs,\" \"slobs,\" \"bimbos\" and \"disgusting animals.\" He characterized many Mexican immigrants as \"killers and rapists\"  and said nothing as supporters suggested setting a protester at one of his rallies on fire.  Although he tried later to deny it, Trump mocked a journalist for his disability.  \nJesus, by contrast, preached love for one's neighbor. He instructed his followers to care for \"the least of these,\" to look after widows and orphans and to welcome the stranger. \nIn the midst of his effusive endorsement, the younger Falwell failed to explain how Trump's construction of a wall on our southern border or his plan for massive deportations lined up with those biblical principles. \nJerry Falwell Jr.'s backing of Donald Trump demonstrates that the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree. The elder Falwell's 1980 embrace of Reagan over Carter, an evangelical Sunday school teacher, represented the triumph of political opportunism over biblical principles.

Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.625,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T01:58:09+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952896067,"created_at":"2016-04-08T01:21:07+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T01:13:39+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"WI","city":"Manitowoc","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915124,"worker_id":13962932,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":1.0,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"2","q1":"0","q2":"2","q3":"-1","q4":"-1","q5":"-1","q6":"0","q7":"0","q8":"2","q9":"-1","q10":"-1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"might_not_vote"},"unit_data":{"nil":"18","index_1":"84","title_1":"First Draft: ‘Super PAC’ Backing Hillary Clinton Says It Will Raise More Than It Did in ’12","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/29/super-pac-backing-hillary-clinton-says-it-is-raising-more-than-it-did-for-obama/","candidate_1":"Hillary Clinton","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"A “super PAC” backing Hillary Clinton raised more than $25 million during the last six months of 2015, officials with the group said on Friday, with $10 million more arriving in January.\n\nThe rising pace of fund-raising puts the group, Priorities USA Action, in a stronger early position than any Democratic super PAC before it, in an election cycle where Republican outside groups are expected to spend heavily to help the party’s eventual nominee reclaim the White House. All told, the group has raised almost $51 million in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nIn addition to the money raised, donors have committed to providing at least $42 million in additional contributions, officials said. Those pledges would allow the group to exceed its total fund-raising for the 2012 cycle, when Priorities was formed to help President Obama win re-election. As of Friday, the group had almost $45 million in cash on hand.\n\n“We have raised significantly more resources than at this point in 2012, built a team of our Party’s strongest leaders and activists, and are developing cutting-edge strategies to reach Democratic and undecided voters in every battleground state,” Guy Cecil, the group’s co-chairman, said in a memorandum obtained by The New York Times.\n\nWhile full details of Priorities’ fund-raising will not be available until the super PAC files its official fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission this weekend, Mr. Cecil’s memorandum said the group had raised money from several labor unions that are backing Mrs. Clinton, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Laborers’ International Union of North America.\n\nA person with knowledge of the group’s fund-raising said the organization had also secured large donations or commitments from a number of wealthy individuals, including James Simons, a New York hedge fund founder, and Danny Abraham, a Florida entrepreneur.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton remains locked in the polls with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire, Priorities has so far banked most of its money for an expected general election campaign. The group’s spending for the 2016 cycle includes just $444,961 on independent expenditures as of Friday, most of it defending Mrs. Clinton from Republican attacks or promoting Mrs. Clinton’s positions.","gunning_fog_1":"12.0","flesch_1":"13.0","readability_1":"46.1","index_2":"104","title_2":"Taking Note: Trump vs. Pope, Round 2","url_2":"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/trump-vs-pope-round-2/","candidate_2":"Donald Trump","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"The headlines are blazing, Twitter is lit up, the political press is all hot for the kind of story it loves to tell: two huge celebrities attacking each other.\n\nMy first impulse on hearing that Pope Francis was calling out Donald Trump personally for his noxious views about immigrants and border walls was to quietly rest my head on my keyboard. It’s always wonderful to see a bully confronted — the bigger the bully, the better — but it was hard to see any good coming of this. Personal attacks are Mr. Trump’s weapon of choice, not the Pope’s, and anyone could have predicted what happened next: Trump struck back with indignant fury, and his people revenge-tweeted about the walls surrounding Vatican City.\n\nFor solace and perspective, I went to find out what America, the level-headed Jesuit magazine, was saying. Its article has a slightly longer quotation than The Times has (italics added): “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.”\n\nThat is an important line. Pope Francis leads the universal Catholic Church, so he is a pretty good authority on what is or is not in the Gospel — the New Testament, the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nOdds are you have a pretty good idea yourself, at least enough to spot which of these two sets of quotations is bona-fide scripture.\n\nA.\n\n“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”\n\n“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.”\n\n“I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”\n\nB.\n\n“They’re bringing crime. They’re bringing drugs. They’re rapists.”\n\n“These are people that shouldn’t be in our country. They flow in like water.”\n\n“Nobody can build a fence like me.”\n\nScripture-quoting is a tricky proposition; show any Bible-thumper a passage to prove a point and he will immediately thump you back with something seemingly contradictory.\n\nBut it’s fair to say that the core of Christian teaching is not “Don’t be a loser.” It’s “Love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\nI have little expectation that today’s episode will lead to any enlightening discussion. But I can at least pray that it might lead to more challenging, probing questioning of the candidates — the Republicans, I mean, who are so quick to lead with their Christian faith, and to summon the blessings of God upon their political endeavors.\n\nBecause there is so much dissonance when the G.O.P. does its holy-rolling thing. There are so many questions.\n\nHow can Ted Cruz begin a rally by invoking the Lord, and then speak as though he is running for war criminal? What do his Christian audiences think when he calls for the indiscriminate bombing of Muslim civilians, and laughs about making sand “glow in the dark” — basically a joke about mass murder?\n\nWhy does someone like Marco Rubio tell heart-warming stories about his immigrant roots, and then, with equal conviction, insist that he will pull up the ladder for more recent, non-qualified immigrant families, the ones his primary voters hate and fear?\n\nWhy has the entire Republican field treated immigrants and refugees, even dead Syrian children washed ashore on a beach, not as victims deserving welcome, but as threats to be shunned?\n\nWhy are immigrants who cross burning deserts to provide for their children, who stand on street corners to take any available job, but not handouts, who embody Republican ideals of faith and family, so hated by the God-and-country crowd?\n\nWhy, with their strong faith and the full might of America to protect them, do the Republican candidates sound so frightened and angry?\n\nA Christian, by definition, believes Jesus is God, who dwelled among us, who was born poor, who preached a Gospel of love, and — though he surely could have annihilated the Romans and blasted his persecutors and made the sands of Galilee glow in the dark — allowed himself to be put to death by the authorities.\n\nWhy is that peaceful Christ never present in Republican speeches?\n\nA Christian is also someone who sees the essential dignity and worth of other human beings. That would have to include immigrants and refugees, those who live and work here without papers, or who are trying to migrate to the United States, who are uprooted by poverty and war. Those who are being murdered by drug traffickers. Who are victims of crime. Who are raped.\n\nI’ll give the last words to Gerard Manley Hopkins, the Victorian poet with the radical style who was a Jesuit, like Pope Francis, and who wrote vividly about God’s presence in the world — and in the people — around us:\n\nI say more: the just man justices;\nKeeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;\nActs in God’s eye what in God’s eye he is –\nChrist – for Christ plays in ten thousand places,\nLovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his\nTo the Father through the features of men’s faces.","gunning_fog_2":"10.0","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"68.1","index_3":"13","title_3":"Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders and Fans Embrace Tune of ‘America’ in Ad Free of Attacks","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-and-fans-embrace-tune-of-america-in-ad-free-of-attacks.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"For a blissful minute, the cacophony of political ads on Iowa television sets vanishes altogether. No speeches, no slurs, only the warm harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel singing “America” can be heard, as down-to-earth Iowa landscapes and scenes of daily life accompany the famous song, in a new ad from Senator Bernie Sanders with the same title.\n\nIowa farmers (including a small child not much bigger than the calf he carries) and city dwellers give way to mostly young people jubilantly flocking to attend his rallies. An expanding grid overtakes the screen, showing the faces of thousands of people who made online donations to Mr. Sanders’s campaign.\n\nA nontraditional offering from a decidedly nontraditional candidate, the ad earned a great deal of news coverage, without saying a word about Mr. Sanders, his platform or his chief opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe ad actually said plenty about how Mr. Sanders views the Democratic presidential contest. As politicians often say but seldom get across so viscerally, the election is ultimately about the voters. By turning over the microphone to Simon and Garfunkel, and aiming the camera not at Mr. Sanders so much as at Iowans generally and his admirers specifically, the ad tries to convey that “what Bernie Sanders is building is a movement in America,” explained Tad Devine, his senior strategist.\n\nThough the ad placed minorities front and center in several shots, David Brock, who runs Correct the Record, a Clinton-aligned group, said the many views of Mr. Sanders’s large crowds showed that his following was overwhelmingly white. “From this ad, it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Brock told The Associated Press. The statement received a harsh rebuke from the Sanders campaign, which recalled Mr. Brock’s early career as a conservative author, calling him a onetime “right-wing extremist.”\n\nThe ad, created by Devine Mulvey Longabaugh, has a vastly different feel from anything else seen in the race since Mrs. Clinton announced her candidacy in a hope-filled two-minute video in April 2015. It strikingly contrasts with Mrs. Clinton’s own minute-long closing argument to Iowans, replete with grave warnings and bold promises. And it is likely to stand out amid the clutter of attack ads and boasts from candidates and their allies in both parties.\n\nChanging channels…\n\nSenator Marco Rubio’s campaign is the first to turn a celebrity endorsement into a television ad, with Rick Harrison, the host of the reality show “Pawn Stars.” Saying he can detect a fraud, Mr. Harrison assures viewers: “When this guy walked into my shop, I knew he was the real deal.”\n\nMost presidential campaigns distill their national message into 30 seconds and plop it between newscasts in the early states. But the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz is focusing on a hyperlocal issue, with a spot that has the look and feel of an ad for a House candidate, not a leading presidential contender: promising to protect Fort Jackson in Columbia, S.C., from thousands of job cuts.\n\nRight to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, came up with an inventive way to make sure its 15-minute video was viewed: by putting it in the mail, not in the form of a DVD but with a video mailer. The mailers, with glossy screens the size of an iPad Mini, arrived in the mailboxes of supporters the campaign considers influential, and the video, the length of a documentary short, began to play as soon as the package was opened.\n\n41 different presidential advertisements ran on Tuesday alone in various markets.\n\n$22 MILLION has been spent in the campaign so far on advertising attacking Mr. Rubio.\n\n$4.8 MILLION in ad time has already been reserved by Right to Rise in Texas, where Republicans vote on March 1.","gunning_fog_3":"9.2","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"61.67","index_4":"73","title_4":"First Draft: Major Donors to Clinton Include Napster Co-Founder","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/14/major-donors-to-clinton-include-napster-co-founder/","candidate_4":"Hillary Clinton","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Sean Parker, the youthful billionaire and co-founder of the music-sharing service Napster, gave nearly $300,000 to a joint fund-raising committee for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and dozens of state Democratic parties, federal filings show. \n\nMr. Parker was one of several donors in recent months to give to the Hillary Victory Fund.

She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}},{"id":1952912149,"created_at":"2016-04-08T01:52:53+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T01:46:58+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"instagc","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"DE","city":"Newark","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915124,"worker_id":21017840,"trust":0.65625,"worker_trust":0.932291666666667,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"0","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"-1","q4":"2","q5":"1","q6":"2","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"18","index_1":"84","title_1":"First Draft: ‘Super PAC’ Backing Hillary Clinton Says It Will Raise More Than It Did in ’12","url_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/29/super-pac-backing-hillary-clinton-says-it-is-raising-more-than-it-did-for-obama/","candidate_1":"Hillary Clinton","org_1":"The New York Times","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"A “super PAC” backing Hillary Clinton raised more than $25 million during the last six months of 2015, officials with the group said on Friday, with $10 million more arriving in January.\n\nThe rising pace of fund-raising puts the group, Priorities USA Action, in a stronger early position than any Democratic super PAC before it, in an election cycle where Republican outside groups are expected to spend heavily to help the party’s eventual nominee reclaim the White House. All told, the group has raised almost $51 million in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nIn addition to the money raised, donors have committed to providing at least $42 million in additional contributions, officials said. Those pledges would allow the group to exceed its total fund-raising for the 2012 cycle, when Priorities was formed to help President Obama win re-election. As of Friday, the group had almost $45 million in cash on hand.\n\n“We have raised significantly more resources than at this point in 2012, built a team of our Party’s strongest leaders and activists, and are developing cutting-edge strategies to reach Democratic and undecided voters in every battleground state,” Guy Cecil, the group’s co-chairman, said in a memorandum obtained by The New York Times.\n\nWhile full details of Priorities’ fund-raising will not be available until the super PAC files its official fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission this weekend, Mr. Cecil’s memorandum said the group had raised money from several labor unions that are backing Mrs. Clinton, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Laborers’ International Union of North America.\n\nA person with knowledge of the group’s fund-raising said the organization had also secured large donations or commitments from a number of wealthy individuals, including James Simons, a New York hedge fund founder, and Danny Abraham, a Florida entrepreneur.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton remains locked in the polls with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire, Priorities has so far banked most of its money for an expected general election campaign. The group’s spending for the 2016 cycle includes just $444,961 on independent expenditures as of Friday, most of it defending Mrs. Clinton from Republican attacks or promoting Mrs. Clinton’s positions.","gunning_fog_1":"12.0","flesch_1":"13.0","readability_1":"46.1","index_2":"104","title_2":"Taking Note: Trump vs. Pope, Round 2","url_2":"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/trump-vs-pope-round-2/","candidate_2":"Donald Trump","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"The headlines are blazing, Twitter is lit up, the political press is all hot for the kind of story it loves to tell: two huge celebrities attacking each other.\n\nMy first impulse on hearing that Pope Francis was calling out Donald Trump personally for his noxious views about immigrants and border walls was to quietly rest my head on my keyboard. It’s always wonderful to see a bully confronted — the bigger the bully, the better — but it was hard to see any good coming of this. Personal attacks are Mr. Trump’s weapon of choice, not the Pope’s, and anyone could have predicted what happened next: Trump struck back with indignant fury, and his people revenge-tweeted about the walls surrounding Vatican City.\n\nFor solace and perspective, I went to find out what America, the level-headed Jesuit magazine, was saying. Its article has a slightly longer quotation than The Times has (italics added): “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.”\n\nThat is an important line. Pope Francis leads the universal Catholic Church, so he is a pretty good authority on what is or is not in the Gospel — the New Testament, the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nOdds are you have a pretty good idea yourself, at least enough to spot which of these two sets of quotations is bona-fide scripture.\n\nA.\n\n“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”\n\n“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.”\n\n“I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”\n\nB.\n\n“They’re bringing crime. They’re bringing drugs. They’re rapists.”\n\n“These are people that shouldn’t be in our country. They flow in like water.”\n\n“Nobody can build a fence like me.”\n\nScripture-quoting is a tricky proposition; show any Bible-thumper a passage to prove a point and he will immediately thump you back with something seemingly contradictory.\n\nBut it’s fair to say that the core of Christian teaching is not “Don’t be a loser.” It’s “Love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\nI have little expectation that today’s episode will lead to any enlightening discussion. But I can at least pray that it might lead to more challenging, probing questioning of the candidates — the Republicans, I mean, who are so quick to lead with their Christian faith, and to summon the blessings of God upon their political endeavors.\n\nBecause there is so much dissonance when the G.O.P. does its holy-rolling thing. There are so many questions.\n\nHow can Ted Cruz begin a rally by invoking the Lord, and then speak as though he is running for war criminal? What do his Christian audiences think when he calls for the indiscriminate bombing of Muslim civilians, and laughs about making sand “glow in the dark” — basically a joke about mass murder?\n\nWhy does someone like Marco Rubio tell heart-warming stories about his immigrant roots, and then, with equal conviction, insist that he will pull up the ladder for more recent, non-qualified immigrant families, the ones his primary voters hate and fear?\n\nWhy has the entire Republican field treated immigrants and refugees, even dead Syrian children washed ashore on a beach, not as victims deserving welcome, but as threats to be shunned?\n\nWhy are immigrants who cross burning deserts to provide for their children, who stand on street corners to take any available job, but not handouts, who embody Republican ideals of faith and family, so hated by the God-and-country crowd?\n\nWhy, with their strong faith and the full might of America to protect them, do the Republican candidates sound so frightened and angry?\n\nA Christian, by definition, believes Jesus is God, who dwelled among us, who was born poor, who preached a Gospel of love, and — though he surely could have annihilated the Romans and blasted his persecutors and made the sands of Galilee glow in the dark — allowed himself to be put to death by the authorities.\n\nWhy is that peaceful Christ never present in Republican speeches?\n\nA Christian is also someone who sees the essential dignity and worth of other human beings. That would have to include immigrants and refugees, those who live and work here without papers, or who are trying to migrate to the United States, who are uprooted by poverty and war. Those who are being murdered by drug traffickers. Who are victims of crime. Who are raped.\n\nI’ll give the last words to Gerard Manley Hopkins, the Victorian poet with the radical style who was a Jesuit, like Pope Francis, and who wrote vividly about God’s presence in the world — and in the people — around us:\n\nI say more: the just man justices;\nKeeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;\nActs in God’s eye what in God’s eye he is –\nChrist – for Christ plays in ten thousand places,\nLovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his\nTo the Father through the features of men’s faces.","gunning_fog_2":"10.0","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"68.1","index_3":"13","title_3":"Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders and Fans Embrace Tune of ‘America’ in Ad Free of Attacks","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-and-fans-embrace-tune-of-america-in-ad-free-of-attacks.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"For a blissful minute, the cacophony of political ads on Iowa television sets vanishes altogether. No speeches, no slurs, only the warm harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel singing “America” can be heard, as down-to-earth Iowa landscapes and scenes of daily life accompany the famous song, in a new ad from Senator Bernie Sanders with the same title.\n\nIowa farmers (including a small child not much bigger than the calf he carries) and city dwellers give way to mostly young people jubilantly flocking to attend his rallies. An expanding grid overtakes the screen, showing the faces of thousands of people who made online donations to Mr. Sanders’s campaign.\n\nA nontraditional offering from a decidedly nontraditional candidate, the ad earned a great deal of news coverage, without saying a word about Mr. Sanders, his platform or his chief opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe ad actually said plenty about how Mr. Sanders views the Democratic presidential contest. As politicians often say but seldom get across so viscerally, the election is ultimately about the voters. By turning over the microphone to Simon and Garfunkel, and aiming the camera not at Mr. Sanders so much as at Iowans generally and his admirers specifically, the ad tries to convey that “what Bernie Sanders is building is a movement in America,” explained Tad Devine, his senior strategist.\n\nThough the ad placed minorities front and center in several shots, David Brock, who runs Correct the Record, a Clinton-aligned group, said the many views of Mr. Sanders’s large crowds showed that his following was overwhelmingly white. “From this ad, it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Brock told The Associated Press. The statement received a harsh rebuke from the Sanders campaign, which recalled Mr. Brock’s early career as a conservative author, calling him a onetime “right-wing extremist.”\n\nThe ad, created by Devine Mulvey Longabaugh, has a vastly different feel from anything else seen in the race since Mrs. Clinton announced her candidacy in a hope-filled two-minute video in April 2015. It strikingly contrasts with Mrs. Clinton’s own minute-long closing argument to Iowans, replete with grave warnings and bold promises. And it is likely to stand out amid the clutter of attack ads and boasts from candidates and their allies in both parties.\n\nChanging channels…\n\nSenator Marco Rubio’s campaign is the first to turn a celebrity endorsement into a television ad, with Rick Harrison, the host of the reality show “Pawn Stars.” Saying he can detect a fraud, Mr. Harrison assures viewers: “When this guy walked into my shop, I knew he was the real deal.”\n\nMost presidential campaigns distill their national message into 30 seconds and plop it between newscasts in the early states. But the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz is focusing on a hyperlocal issue, with a spot that has the look and feel of an ad for a House candidate, not a leading presidential contender: promising to protect Fort Jackson in Columbia, S.C., from thousands of job cuts.\n\nRight to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, came up with an inventive way to make sure its 15-minute video was viewed: by putting it in the mail, not in the form of a DVD but with a video mailer. The mailers, with glossy screens the size of an iPad Mini, arrived in the mailboxes of supporters the campaign considers influential, and the video, the length of a documentary short, began to play as soon as the package was opened.\n\n41 different presidential advertisements ran on Tuesday alone in various markets.\n\n$22 MILLION has been spent in the campaign so far on advertising attacking Mr. Rubio.\n\n$4.8 MILLION in ad time has already been reserved by Right to Rise in Texas, where Republicans vote on March 1.","gunning_fog_3":"9.2","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"61.67","index_4":"73","title_4":"First Draft: Major Donors to Clinton Include Napster Co-Founder","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/14/major-donors-to-clinton-include-napster-co-founder/","candidate_4":"Hillary Clinton","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Sean Parker, the youthful billionaire and co-founder of the music-sharing service Napster, gave nearly $300,000 to a joint fund-raising committee for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and dozens of state Democratic parties, federal filings show. \n\nMr. Parker was one of several donors in recent months to give to the Hillary Victory Fund. Others include the media mogul Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl, and the billionaire trader and philanthropist George Soros; all gave more than $300,000. The Chicago-based entrepreneur J.B. Pritzker gave more than $350,000. \n\nThe latter donors have been long familiar to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Parker, by contrast, is relatively new to the world of political giving, having only become a donor in the last several years. He has held meetings with politicians as disparate as Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. He gave to President Obama’s re-election effort in 2012 and also to the immigration reform group FWD.us. \n\nIn the joint fund-raising entities, the Clinton campaign has asked major donors to consider giving money, because they face a number of options for gifts to the Democratic candidate that exceed $2,700, the maximum contribution allowed in the primary campaign.

You can't make this up.\nFalwell's father and namesake was one of the architects of the Religious Right in the late 1970s, arguing that politically conservative evangelicals should be active in the pursuit of \"biblical values\" in the arena of politics. Although Falwell's politics were misguided -- he mobilized politically to defend the tax-exempt status of his own Liberty Christian Academy and other so-called segregation academies -- the elder Falwell, at times at least, upheld the pretense that his political agenda was shaped by the principles set forth in the Bible, even as he led evangelicals away from their historical concern for the poor, for women and minorities and into the maw of right-wing politics.\nHis son and successor as head of Liberty University has abandoned all pretense that biblical values inform his politics. The younger Falwell, however, is very much like his father in one crucial respect: He clearly is more interested in political influence than scriptural principles. \nIn his endorsement, Falwell Jr. did not anoint Trump as the most righteous candidate; that distinction would probably go to Bernie Sanders, a self-described secular Jew who calls out moneyed interests with the passion of the Hebrew prophets. Falwell, however, hailed Trump as \"a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.\" \nTrump is on his third marriage. Whether or not he qualifies as a \"wonderful father\" is not for me to judge, although he has eerily suggested that, were she not his daughter, he'd consider dating Ivanka Trump (his daughter). Similarly, in 1980, Jerry Falwell Sr., while proclaiming his support for \"family values,\" embraced the divorced and remarried Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter.\nAnd what about biblical values, which are supposed to be at the core of the Religious Right? Jesus was emphatic that his followers busy themselves with caring for people on the margins, a concern that does not appear to be animating the Trump campaign. Jesus described those who would be admitted into the kingdom of heaven as those who demonstrated acts of kindness toward people in need. Those gestures would be reckoned as though they were directed to Jesus himself: \"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\" \nJesus spent his entire earthly ministry with outcasts, healing the sick and the lame,while Trump regularly makes fun of people he labels \"losers.\"  Whereas Jesus was especially gracious toward children and women, Trump, on the other hand, derides women as \"pigs,\" \"dogs,\" \"slobs,\" \"bimbos\" and \"disgusting animals.\" He characterized many Mexican immigrants as \"killers and rapists\"  and said nothing as supporters suggested setting a protester at one of his rallies on fire.  Although he tried later to deny it, Trump mocked a journalist for his disability.  \nJesus, by contrast, preached love for one's neighbor. He instructed his followers to care for \"the least of these,\" to look after widows and orphans and to welcome the stranger. \nIn the midst of his effusive endorsement, the younger Falwell failed to explain how Trump's construction of a wall on our southern border or his plan for massive deportations lined up with those biblical principles. \nJerry Falwell Jr.'s backing of Donald Trump demonstrates that the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree. The elder Falwell's 1980 embrace of Reagan over Carter, an evangelical Sunday school teacher, represented the triumph of political opportunism over biblical principles. His son's endorsement of Trump looks much the same.\nSatire is dead.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.","gunning_fog_5":"10.4","flesch_5":"11.5","readability_5":"50.16","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination","gold_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html?_r=0","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The New York Times","gold_body":"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world.

All told, the group has raised almost $51 million in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nIn addition to the money raised, donors have committed to providing at least $42 million in additional contributions, officials said. Those pledges would allow the group to exceed its total fund-raising for the 2012 cycle, when Priorities was formed to help President Obama win re-election. As of Friday, the group had almost $45 million in cash on hand.\n\n“We have raised significantly more resources than at this point in 2012, built a team of our Party’s strongest leaders and activists, and are developing cutting-edge strategies to reach Democratic and undecided voters in every battleground state,” Guy Cecil, the group’s co-chairman, said in a memorandum obtained by The New York Times.\n\nWhile full details of Priorities’ fund-raising will not be available until the super PAC files its official fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission this weekend, Mr. Cecil’s memorandum said the group had raised money from several labor unions that are backing Mrs. Clinton, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Laborers’ International Union of North America.\n\nA person with knowledge of the group’s fund-raising said the organization had also secured large donations or commitments from a number of wealthy individuals, including James Simons, a New York hedge fund founder, and Danny Abraham, a Florida entrepreneur.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton remains locked in the polls with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire, Priorities has so far banked most of its money for an expected general election campaign. The group’s spending for the 2016 cycle includes just $444,961 on independent expenditures as of Friday, most of it defending Mrs. Clinton from Republican attacks or promoting Mrs. Clinton’s positions.","gunning_fog_1":"12.0","flesch_1":"13.0","readability_1":"46.1","index_2":"104","title_2":"Taking Note: Trump vs. Pope, Round 2","url_2":"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/trump-vs-pope-round-2/","candidate_2":"Donald Trump","org_2":"The New York Times","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"The headlines are blazing, Twitter is lit up, the political press is all hot for the kind of story it loves to tell: two huge celebrities attacking each other.\n\nMy first impulse on hearing that Pope Francis was calling out Donald Trump personally for his noxious views about immigrants and border walls was to quietly rest my head on my keyboard. It’s always wonderful to see a bully confronted — the bigger the bully, the better — but it was hard to see any good coming of this. Personal attacks are Mr. Trump’s weapon of choice, not the Pope’s, and anyone could have predicted what happened next: Trump struck back with indignant fury, and his people revenge-tweeted about the walls surrounding Vatican City.\n\nFor solace and perspective, I went to find out what America, the level-headed Jesuit magazine, was saying. Its article has a slightly longer quotation than The Times has (italics added): “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.”\n\nThat is an important line. Pope Francis leads the universal Catholic Church, so he is a pretty good authority on what is or is not in the Gospel — the New Testament, the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nOdds are you have a pretty good idea yourself, at least enough to spot which of these two sets of quotations is bona-fide scripture.\n\nA.\n\n“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”\n\n“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.”\n\n“I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”\n\nB.\n\n“They’re bringing crime. They’re bringing drugs. They’re rapists.”\n\n“These are people that shouldn’t be in our country. They flow in like water.”\n\n“Nobody can build a fence like me.”\n\nScripture-quoting is a tricky proposition; show any Bible-thumper a passage to prove a point and he will immediately thump you back with something seemingly contradictory.\n\nBut it’s fair to say that the core of Christian teaching is not “Don’t be a loser.” It’s “Love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\nI have little expectation that today’s episode will lead to any enlightening discussion. But I can at least pray that it might lead to more challenging, probing questioning of the candidates — the Republicans, I mean, who are so quick to lead with their Christian faith, and to summon the blessings of God upon their political endeavors.\n\nBecause there is so much dissonance when the G.O.P. does its holy-rolling thing. There are so many questions.\n\nHow can Ted Cruz begin a rally by invoking the Lord, and then speak as though he is running for war criminal? What do his Christian audiences think when he calls for the indiscriminate bombing of Muslim civilians, and laughs about making sand “glow in the dark” — basically a joke about mass murder?\n\nWhy does someone like Marco Rubio tell heart-warming stories about his immigrant roots, and then, with equal conviction, insist that he will pull up the ladder for more recent, non-qualified immigrant families, the ones his primary voters hate and fear?\n\nWhy has the entire Republican field treated immigrants and refugees, even dead Syrian children washed ashore on a beach, not as victims deserving welcome, but as threats to be shunned?\n\nWhy are immigrants who cross burning deserts to provide for their children, who stand on street corners to take any available job, but not handouts, who embody Republican ideals of faith and family, so hated by the God-and-country crowd?\n\nWhy, with their strong faith and the full might of America to protect them, do the Republican candidates sound so frightened and angry?\n\nA Christian, by definition, believes Jesus is God, who dwelled among us, who was born poor, who preached a Gospel of love, and — though he surely could have annihilated the Romans and blasted his persecutors and made the sands of Galilee glow in the dark — allowed himself to be put to death by the authorities.\n\nWhy is that peaceful Christ never present in Republican speeches?\n\nA Christian is also someone who sees the essential dignity and worth of other human beings. That would have to include immigrants and refugees, those who live and work here without papers, or who are trying to migrate to the United States, who are uprooted by poverty and war. Those who are being murdered by drug traffickers. Who are victims of crime. Who are raped.\n\nI’ll give the last words to Gerard Manley Hopkins, the Victorian poet with the radical style who was a Jesuit, like Pope Francis, and who wrote vividly about God’s presence in the world — and in the people — around us:\n\nI say more: the just man justices;\nKeeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;\nActs in God’s eye what in God’s eye he is –\nChrist – for Christ plays in ten thousand places,\nLovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his\nTo the Father through the features of men’s faces.","gunning_fog_2":"10.0","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"68.1","index_3":"13","title_3":"Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders and Fans Embrace Tune of ‘America’ in Ad Free of Attacks","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-and-fans-embrace-tune-of-america-in-ad-free-of-attacks.html","candidate_3":"Bernie Sanders","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Campaign Finance","body_3":"For a blissful minute, the cacophony of political ads on Iowa television sets vanishes altogether. No speeches, no slurs, only the warm harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel singing “America” can be heard, as down-to-earth Iowa landscapes and scenes of daily life accompany the famous song, in a new ad from Senator Bernie Sanders with the same title.\n\nIowa farmers (including a small child not much bigger than the calf he carries) and city dwellers give way to mostly young people jubilantly flocking to attend his rallies. An expanding grid overtakes the screen, showing the faces of thousands of people who made online donations to Mr. Sanders’s campaign.\n\nA nontraditional offering from a decidedly nontraditional candidate, the ad earned a great deal of news coverage, without saying a word about Mr. Sanders, his platform or his chief opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe ad actually said plenty about how Mr. Sanders views the Democratic presidential contest. As politicians often say but seldom get across so viscerally, the election is ultimately about the voters. By turning over the microphone to Simon and Garfunkel, and aiming the camera not at Mr. Sanders so much as at Iowans generally and his admirers specifically, the ad tries to convey that “what Bernie Sanders is building is a movement in America,” explained Tad Devine, his senior strategist.\n\nThough the ad placed minorities front and center in several shots, David Brock, who runs Correct the Record, a Clinton-aligned group, said the many views of Mr. Sanders’s large crowds showed that his following was overwhelmingly white. “From this ad, it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Brock told The Associated Press. The statement received a harsh rebuke from the Sanders campaign, which recalled Mr. Brock’s early career as a conservative author, calling him a onetime “right-wing extremist.”\n\nThe ad, created by Devine Mulvey Longabaugh, has a vastly different feel from anything else seen in the race since Mrs. Clinton announced her candidacy in a hope-filled two-minute video in April 2015. It strikingly contrasts with Mrs. Clinton’s own minute-long closing argument to Iowans, replete with grave warnings and bold promises. And it is likely to stand out amid the clutter of attack ads and boasts from candidates and their allies in both parties.\n\nChanging channels…\n\nSenator Marco Rubio’s campaign is the first to turn a celebrity endorsement into a television ad, with Rick Harrison, the host of the reality show “Pawn Stars.” Saying he can detect a fraud, Mr. Harrison assures viewers: “When this guy walked into my shop, I knew he was the real deal.”\n\nMost presidential campaigns distill their national message into 30 seconds and plop it between newscasts in the early states. But the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz is focusing on a hyperlocal issue, with a spot that has the look and feel of an ad for a House candidate, not a leading presidential contender: promising to protect Fort Jackson in Columbia, S.C., from thousands of job cuts.\n\nRight to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, came up with an inventive way to make sure its 15-minute video was viewed: by putting it in the mail, not in the form of a DVD but with a video mailer. The mailers, with glossy screens the size of an iPad Mini, arrived in the mailboxes of supporters the campaign considers influential, and the video, the length of a documentary short, began to play as soon as the package was opened.\n\n41 different presidential advertisements ran on Tuesday alone in various markets.\n\n$22 MILLION has been spent in the campaign so far on advertising attacking Mr. Rubio.\n\n$4.8 MILLION in ad time has already been reserved by Right to Rise in Texas, where Republicans vote on March 1.","gunning_fog_3":"9.2","flesch_3":"9.1","readability_3":"61.67","index_4":"73","title_4":"First Draft: Major Donors to Clinton Include Napster Co-Founder","url_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/14/major-donors-to-clinton-include-napster-co-founder/","candidate_4":"Hillary Clinton","org_4":"The New York Times","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Sean Parker, the youthful billionaire and co-founder of the music-sharing service Napster, gave nearly $300,000 to a joint fund-raising committee for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and dozens of state Democratic parties, federal filings show. \n\nMr. Parker was one of several donors in recent months to give to the Hillary Victory Fund. Others include the media mogul Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl, and the billionaire trader and philanthropist George Soros; all gave more than $300,000. The Chicago-based entrepreneur J.B. Pritzker gave more than $350,000. \n\nThe latter donors have been long familiar to Mrs. Clinton.

You can't make this up.\nFalwell's father and namesake was one of the architects of the Religious Right in the late 1970s, arguing that politically conservative evangelicals should be active in the pursuit of \"biblical values\" in the arena of politics. Although Falwell's politics were misguided -- he mobilized politically to defend the tax-exempt status of his own Liberty Christian Academy and other so-called segregation academies -- the elder Falwell, at times at least, upheld the pretense that his political agenda was shaped by the principles set forth in the Bible, even as he led evangelicals away from their historical concern for the poor, for women and minorities and into the maw of right-wing politics.\nHis son and successor as head of Liberty University has abandoned all pretense that biblical values inform his politics. The younger Falwell, however, is very much like his father in one crucial respect: He clearly is more interested in political influence than scriptural principles. \nIn his endorsement, Falwell Jr. did not anoint Trump as the most righteous candidate; that distinction would probably go to Bernie Sanders, a self-described secular Jew who calls out moneyed interests with the passion of the Hebrew prophets. Falwell, however, hailed Trump as \"a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.\" \nTrump is on his third marriage. Whether or not he qualifies as a \"wonderful father\" is not for me to judge, although he has eerily suggested that, were she not his daughter, he'd consider dating Ivanka Trump (his daughter). Similarly, in 1980, Jerry Falwell Sr., while proclaiming his support for \"family values,\" embraced the divorced and remarried Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter.\nAnd what about biblical values, which are supposed to be at the core of the Religious Right? Jesus was emphatic that his followers busy themselves with caring for people on the margins, a concern that does not appear to be animating the Trump campaign. Jesus described those who would be admitted into the kingdom of heaven as those who demonstrated acts of kindness toward people in need. Those gestures would be reckoned as though they were directed to Jesus himself: \"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\" \nJesus spent his entire earthly ministry with outcasts, healing the sick and the lame,while Trump regularly makes fun of people he labels \"losers.\"  Whereas Jesus was especially gracious toward children and women, Trump, on the other hand, derides women as \"pigs,\" \"dogs,\" \"slobs,\" \"bimbos\" and \"disgusting animals.\" He characterized many Mexican immigrants as \"killers and rapists\"  and said nothing as supporters suggested setting a protester at one of his rallies on fire.  Although he tried later to deny it, Trump mocked a journalist for his disability.  \nJesus, by contrast, preached love for one's neighbor. He instructed his followers to care for \"the least of these,\" to look after widows and orphans and to welcome the stranger. \nIn the midst of his effusive endorsement, the younger Falwell failed to explain how Trump's construction of a wall on our southern border or his plan for massive deportations lined up with those biblical principles. \nJerry Falwell Jr.'s backing of Donald Trump demonstrates that the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree. The elder Falwell's 1980 embrace of Reagan over Carter, an evangelical Sunday school teacher, represented the triumph of political opportunism over biblical principles. His son's endorsement of Trump looks much the same.\nSatire is dead.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.","gunning_fog_5":"10.4","flesch_5":"11.5","readability_5":"50.16","gold_title":"Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination","gold_url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html?_r=0","gold_candidate":"Hillary Clinton","gold_org":"The New York Times","gold_body":"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.\n\nHillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state — not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office — twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system — have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren’t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.\n\nThe third Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had — governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore — than for president.\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.\n\nMr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.\n \nMrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.\n\nMrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.\n\nIn January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.\n\nMrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.\n\nMrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.\n\nHillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.4423963133640552},"q1":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q2":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.4423963133640552},"q3":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q4":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.7096774193548387},"q5":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.4423963133640552},"q6":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4423963133640552},"q7":{"agg":"0","confidence":1.0},"q8":{"agg":"2","confidence":0.4423963133640552},"q9":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.7096774193548387},"q10":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.7096774193548387},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"female","confidence":0.7096774193548387},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":0.7327188940092165},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"independent_other","confidence":0.5576036866359447},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"might_not_vote","confidence":0.4423963133640552}}}

Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said the raids reflected the administration's top priorities for deportation  people with criminal convictions and people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. But critics said the searches were ill-timed and disruptive for families.\nOffering support for comprehensive immigration reform at the Putting Families First Presidential Forum, Sanders and O'Malley also slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump over his statements about Muslims.

That is only $2 million more than the $26.2 million the campaign had in the bank at the end of the third quarter of 2015, meaning Sanders' operation spent the bulk of what they raised in the fourth quarter.\nMuch of that spending, according to aides, was focused on building infrastructure in early primary states, including deploying organizers to South Carolina and Nevada, and building the campaign's already existing organization in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nFor the year, Sanders' campaign spent 61% of the money it brought in.\n \nSanders has long been a formidable fundraiser with deep roots in online and small donor fundraising, but even some of his closest aides were unsure he could raise the money needed to run a presidential campaign when the launched earlier this year. Tad Devine, his top strategist, said that the operation had hoped to bring in between $40 and $50 million by the end of 2015.\nSanders smashed that goal, but in a dramatically different way than Clinton did.\nA bulk of Clinton's haul came from fundraisers she or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, personally headlined. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. And the former president headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter.\nAccording to CNN's analysis, fundraisers personally headlined by Clinton brought in at least $22 million in the forth quarter.\nSanders, however, only headlined two fundraisers in the last three months of 2015, bringing his year total to nine, while Clinton's total for the year was 174.\nWhat's more, almost all of Sanders' donors have yet to reach the $2,700 max donation, according to aides, who said Saturday that only around 600 Sanders supporters have maxed out.\nThat means Sanders' campaign can continue to hit up their donors for small donations as the primary calendar moves along.\nSanders' campaign has also raised big money at notable moments in the fourth quarter. Sanders' aides bragged that the campaign raised $2.5 million in the two days after the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas.\nAnd the day after the campaign breached the Clinton campaign's voter data -- and subsequently sued the Democratic National Committee -- aides said the campaign raised more than $1 million.","gunning_fog_3":"9.6","flesch_3":"9.5","readability_3":"60.65","index_4":"42","title_4":"New Yorkers blast Cruz's comments on 'New York values'","url_4":"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-01-15-US--Cruz-New%20York%20Values/id-1d883b4be3d04a2898b9dafad2200b02","candidate_4":"Ted Cruz","org_4":"the Associated Press","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"(AP)  When Ted Cruz sneered at what he called Donald Trump's \"New York values,\" some New Yorkers took it very personally. And some responded about the way you'd expect New Yorkers to react.\nThe ever-combative Daily News hit the streets with a big front-page illustration of the Statue of Liberty giving Cruz the finger. The headline: \"DROP DEAD, TED.\" And in a reference to the Texas senator's birthplace, the tabloid added: \"You don't like N.Y. values? Go back to Canada!\"\nOn the morning after Thursday night's Republican presidential debate, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took to the airwaves to denounce the candidate and demand an apology for comments he called \"obnoxious on every level.\"\nThe use of \"New York values\" as a term of abuse rankled plenty of city residents.\n\"Like that's a bad thing?\" said Willie Perry, a real estate salesman and registered Republican, as he headed to work in New York City. \"Actually it's a good thing. I think that's ludicrous. What did he mean by that?\"\nJohn Markowski, a minister who was dropping his son off at a public school, said: \"It's insulting for anyone to make a derogatory comment about New York values. I think we pride ourselves on being a place of diversity and equality.\"\nDuring the debate, moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Cruz to explain past comments he had made about Trump embodying \"New York values.\"\n\"You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are,\" Cruz said.\n\"I am from New York. I don't,\" Bartiromo said.\nSo the GOP conservative explained: \"Listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.\"\nTrump responded movingly by citing the city's response to 9/11.\n\"When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,\" he said to applause from the crowd in North Charleston, South Carolina. \"We rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.\"\nHe added: \"And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\"\nOne in 38 Americans lives in New York City, but the state's record of going for the Democrat in the winner-take-all electoral college system means Republicans rarely have to worry about insulting the populace. Bashing the big city has long been a winning strategy in more conservative parts of the country, namely the Midwest and the South.\nNot a lot of New Yorkers have given money to Cruz's bid for the White House. His campaign took in only about $487,000 from New York contributors through Sept. 30, according to the most recent filings. But one New Yorker, Wall Street hedge fund mogul Robert Mercer, contributed $11 million last April to a super PAC that supports Cruz.\nCruz \"has no trouble taking money from New York City, but he's quick to insult our people and our values,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio, a liberal Democrat.","gunning_fog_4":"8.4","flesch_4":"8.4","readability_4":"63.7","index_5":"81","title_5":"Hillary Clinton hopes for strong Latino turnout in Nevada","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/nevada-caucus-democrats-2016/index.html","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Las Vegas (CNN) Bracing for another close race in a state that was once viewed as her firewall, Hillary Clinton is counting on a strong turnout among Latino voters in the Nevada caucuses Saturday to hold off Bernie Sanders' momentum in this critical swing state.\nWith polling showing a dead heat between Clinton and Sanders among likely caucusgoers, Clinton's surrogates fanned out across the Silver State this week, attempting to portray her as the more trustworthy candidate for Latinos as they work to ramp up participation by her supporters in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County.\nIn the final days, Clinton's allies have slashed Sanders' immigration record, criticizing him as a \"johnny-come-lately\" to the issue who has been too vague about his plans. At the same time, they have continued their push for Clinton in Nevada's rural counties -- where Clinton's canvassers have been pressing the case that Sanders' proposals are unrealistic and unachievable in the current political climate.\nA strong win would provide a jolt of momentum to Clinton heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.\nA loss, or even another close finish with Sanders in Nevada, would further chip away at the aura of electability that once surrounded her path to the nomination, serving as a testament to the strength of Sanders' momentum even in a heavily Latino state where she was organized six months ahead of him. \nAn estimated 40% of the state's Democratic voters are non-white -- and Clinton was expected to show her strength among minority voters with a good showing here. But Sanders has emphasized his family's immigrant roots here in ads and on the campaign trail, noting that his father was a Polish immigrant to America who originally spoke little English. \n\"Immigration isn't just a word for Bernie Sanders,\" the narrator said in one Spanish-language radio ad for his campaign in November. \"His story is the immigrant story.\" \nBeyond Clinton's breakneck campaign schedule here this week, there were other signs of concern within her campaign about the unexpected strength of the Sanders effort here.\nOn the same day that Clinton released an emotional immigration ad featuring Clinton talking to a tearful 10-year-old girl about the deportation letter that her parents received, her operatives added a half-million dollars to their ad spending on broadcast, satellite and cable for a total of $3.4 million to Sanders' $3.7 million, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising.\nThe Clinton campaign is also clearly looking at caucus states beyond Nevada, dispatching Bill Clinton to speak to voters in the upcoming contest of Colorado even as the post-caucus celebrations get underway in Nevada Saturday evening.\nClinton repeatedly dropped in on employees at the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in her efforts to boost Clark County turnout. Both campaigns had heavily courted the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which supported Obama in 2008 and helped him turn out voters to caucus. But in a blow to Clinton's campaign, they chose to stay neutral this year.\nStill, the former secretary of state greeted workers from that union during an overnight stop at Caesar's Palace Thursday after flying in from Chicago. Both she and her husband will visit the caucus site -- which is aimed at making it easier for Strip shift workers to participate during their work day -- at Caesar's Palace on Saturday afternoon while the caucus is underway.   \n\"I know you do a hard job,\" she told Caesar's Palace housekeeping workers during her overnight visit to their linen room. She said that when she arrived at the hotel, she had asked herself: \"Who is still working?\"\n\"A lot of people are,\" she said, before asking the workers to caucus for her at the hotel Saturday.\nLike Obama in 2008, Sanders is counting on a strong turnout from first-time caucusgoers, though not nearly as many are expected as eight years ago when some 120,000 turned out.\nThough Clinton is perceived as having an advantage with voters in Clark County, in part because of her strong support from labor unions, the Vermont senator spent a good amount of time campaigning around the populous areas of Las Vegas this week before heading to Elko, Nevada, on Friday to rally rural voters.\nDuring both an MSNBC forum and a speech at the Clark County Democratic Dinner on Thursday night, Sanders made a direct pitch to Latinos by chiding Donald Trump for vilifying immigrants. He argued that Congress \"must move towards a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\"\n\"While I understand that there are people who have differences of opinion with me on immigration reform, there is no justification, no reason, to resort to bigotry and xenophobia when we are talking about Mexicans or we are talking about Muslims,\" Sanders said at the Democratic dinner at the Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\"People can disagree about immigration reform, but in the year 2016, we will not allow the Trumps and others to divide us up and appeal to racism, which has done this country so much harm for so many years,\" he said.\nDuring the MSNBC/Telemundo forum, Sanders also defended his 2007 vote against legislation that would have revamped the immigration system, stating that he objected to guest-worker provisions that were described by one legal advocacy group as being \"akin to slavery.\"  \nBoth Sanders and Clinton have also made an aggressive play for Nevada's rural voters this cycle. Clinton won the popular vote here in 2008. But by organizing in the delegate-rich rural counties of Nevada, Obama won more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Clinton.\nClinton is heavily organized in those rural counties this time. The looming question is whether her campaign will be able to overcome the enthusiasm for Sanders, as well as a palpable level of discomfort with her position on gun control compared to Sanders' more moderate stances. \nAt a town hall in Elko Friday morning, Sanders stressed the importance of turnout among rural voters to his campaign, calling on them to show the world the desire for a \"political revolution that transforms this country.\"\n\"I really believe this from my heart of hearts: obviously we are here to win and hope to win. I want democracy to flourish,\" the Vermont senator said. \"I hope Nevada turns out -- I hope we have a YUGE turnout -- I'm afraid to use that word! But I hope we have a very, very large voter turnout. Show the world that democracy is alive and well in Nevada.\"\nCNN's Elizabeth Landers, Dan Merica and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","gunning_fog_5":"12.0","flesch_5":"13.0","readability_5":"46.1","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.666666666666667,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T03:09:16+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952947080,"created_at":"2016-04-08T03:02:46+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T02:57:08+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"San Jose","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915125,"worker_id":34898132,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.959375,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"-1","q1":"1","q2":"0","q3":"1","q4":"1","q5":"1","q6":"0","q7":"-1","q8":"-1","q9":"1","q10":"0","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"3049","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"hillary_clinton"},"unit_data":{"nil":"19","index_1":"25","title_1":"Sanders, O'Malley criticize immigration raids at Iowa forum","url_1":"http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-01-09-US--DEM%202016/id-36d0b67119f64688ad1213e54f5495ef","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"the Associated Press","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)  Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley used a liberal forum in Iowa on Saturday to rail against holiday-season raids seeking Central American immigrants for deportation.\nBefore about 1,000 people packed into a Des Moines church, Sanders said that while he works closely with President Barack Obama, \"I do not agree with him on his policy toward deportation.\" And O'Malley bemoaned the timing of the raids, stating that \"Jesus himself was a refugee child.\"\nBoth candidates had previously criticized the raids, which first became public when The Washington Post published a story about the plans just before Christmas.\nThe White House defended the policies Friday.

The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. And the former president headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter.\nAccording to CNN's analysis, fundraisers personally headlined by Clinton brought in at least $22 million in the forth quarter.\nSanders, however, only headlined two fundraisers in the last three months of 2015, bringing his year total to nine, while Clinton's total for the year was 174.\nWhat's more, almost all of Sanders' donors have yet to reach the $2,700 max donation, according to aides, who said Saturday that only around 600 Sanders supporters have maxed out.\nThat means Sanders' campaign can continue to hit up their donors for small donations as the primary calendar moves along.\nSanders' campaign has also raised big money at notable moments in the fourth quarter.

And some responded about the way you'd expect New Yorkers to react.\nThe ever-combative Daily News hit the streets with a big front-page illustration of the Statue of Liberty giving Cruz the finger. The headline: \"DROP DEAD, TED.\" And in a reference to the Texas senator's birthplace, the tabloid added: \"You don't like N.Y. values? Go back to Canada!\"\nOn the morning after Thursday night's Republican presidential debate, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took to the airwaves to denounce the candidate and demand an apology for comments he called \"obnoxious on every level.\"\nThe use of \"New York values\" as a term of abuse rankled plenty of city residents.\n\"Like that's a bad thing?\" said Willie Perry, a real estate salesman and registered Republican, as he headed to work in New York City. \"Actually it's a good thing. I think that's ludicrous. What did he mean by that?\"\nJohn Markowski, a minister who was dropping his son off at a public school, said: \"It's insulting for anyone to make a derogatory comment about New York values. I think we pride ourselves on being a place of diversity and equality.\"\nDuring the debate, moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Cruz to explain past comments he had made about Trump embodying \"New York values.\"\n\"You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are,\" Cruz said.\n\"I am from New York. I don't,\" Bartiromo said.\nSo the GOP conservative explained: \"Listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.\"\nTrump responded movingly by citing the city's response to 9/11.\n\"When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,\" he said to applause from the crowd in North Charleston, South Carolina. \"We rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.\"\nHe added: \"And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\"\nOne in 38 Americans lives in New York City, but the state's record of going for the Democrat in the winner-take-all electoral college system means Republicans rarely have to worry about insulting the populace. Bashing the big city has long been a winning strategy in more conservative parts of the country, namely the Midwest and the South.\nNot a lot of New Yorkers have given money to Cruz's bid for the White House. His campaign took in only about $487,000 from New York contributors through Sept. 30, according to the most recent filings. But one New Yorker, Wall Street hedge fund mogul Robert Mercer, contributed $11 million last April to a super PAC that supports Cruz.\nCruz \"has no trouble taking money from New York City, but he's quick to insult our people and our values,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio, a liberal Democrat.","gunning_fog_4":"8.4","flesch_4":"8.4","readability_4":"63.7","index_5":"81","title_5":"Hillary Clinton hopes for strong Latino turnout in Nevada","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/nevada-caucus-democrats-2016/index.html","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Las Vegas (CNN) Bracing for another close race in a state that was once viewed as her firewall, Hillary Clinton is counting on a strong turnout among Latino voters in the Nevada caucuses Saturday to hold off Bernie Sanders' momentum in this critical swing state.\nWith polling showing a dead heat between Clinton and Sanders among likely caucusgoers, Clinton's surrogates fanned out across the Silver State this week, attempting to portray her as the more trustworthy candidate for Latinos as they work to ramp up participation by her supporters in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County.\nIn the final days, Clinton's allies have slashed Sanders' immigration record, criticizing him as a \"johnny-come-lately\" to the issue who has been too vague about his plans. At the same time, they have continued their push for Clinton in Nevada's rural counties -- where Clinton's canvassers have been pressing the case that Sanders' proposals are unrealistic and unachievable in the current political climate.\nA strong win would provide a jolt of momentum to Clinton heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.\nA loss, or even another close finish with Sanders in Nevada, would further chip away at the aura of electability that once surrounded her path to the nomination, serving as a testament to the strength of Sanders' momentum even in a heavily Latino state where she was organized six months ahead of him. \nAn estimated 40% of the state's Democratic voters are non-white -- and Clinton was expected to show her strength among minority voters with a good showing here. But Sanders has emphasized his family's immigrant roots here in ads and on the campaign trail, noting that his father was a Polish immigrant to America who originally spoke little English. \n\"Immigration isn't just a word for Bernie Sanders,\" the narrator said in one Spanish-language radio ad for his campaign in November. \"His story is the immigrant story.\" \nBeyond Clinton's breakneck campaign schedule here this week, there were other signs of concern within her campaign about the unexpected strength of the Sanders effort here.\nOn the same day that Clinton released an emotional immigration ad featuring Clinton talking to a tearful 10-year-old girl about the deportation letter that her parents received, her operatives added a half-million dollars to their ad spending on broadcast, satellite and cable for a total of $3.4 million to Sanders' $3.7 million, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising.\nThe Clinton campaign is also clearly looking at caucus states beyond Nevada, dispatching Bill Clinton to speak to voters in the upcoming contest of Colorado even as the post-caucus celebrations get underway in Nevada Saturday evening.\nClinton repeatedly dropped in on employees at the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in her efforts to boost Clark County turnout. Both campaigns had heavily courted the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which supported Obama in 2008 and helped him turn out voters to caucus. But in a blow to Clinton's campaign, they chose to stay neutral this year.\nStill, the former secretary of state greeted workers from that union during an overnight stop at Caesar's Palace Thursday after flying in from Chicago. Both she and her husband will visit the caucus site -- which is aimed at making it easier for Strip shift workers to participate during their work day -- at Caesar's Palace on Saturday afternoon while the caucus is underway.   \n\"I know you do a hard job,\" she told Caesar's Palace housekeeping workers during her overnight visit to their linen room. She said that when she arrived at the hotel, she had asked herself: \"Who is still working?\"\n\"A lot of people are,\" she said, before asking the workers to caucus for her at the hotel Saturday.\nLike Obama in 2008, Sanders is counting on a strong turnout from first-time caucusgoers, though not nearly as many are expected as eight years ago when some 120,000 turned out.\nThough Clinton is perceived as having an advantage with voters in Clark County, in part because of her strong support from labor unions, the Vermont senator spent a good amount of time campaigning around the populous areas of Las Vegas this week before heading to Elko, Nevada, on Friday to rally rural voters.\nDuring both an MSNBC forum and a speech at the Clark County Democratic Dinner on Thursday night, Sanders made a direct pitch to Latinos by chiding Donald Trump for vilifying immigrants. He argued that Congress \"must move towards a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\"\n\"While I understand that there are people who have differences of opinion with me on immigration reform, there is no justification, no reason, to resort to bigotry and xenophobia when we are talking about Mexicans or we are talking about Muslims,\" Sanders said at the Democratic dinner at the Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\"People can disagree about immigration reform, but in the year 2016, we will not allow the Trumps and others to divide us up and appeal to racism, which has done this country so much harm for so many years,\" he said.\nDuring the MSNBC/Telemundo forum, Sanders also defended his 2007 vote against legislation that would have revamped the immigration system, stating that he objected to guest-worker provisions that were described by one legal advocacy group as being \"akin to slavery.\"  \nBoth Sanders and Clinton have also made an aggressive play for Nevada's rural voters this cycle. Clinton won the popular vote here in 2008. But by organizing in the delegate-rich rural counties of Nevada, Obama won more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Clinton.\nClinton is heavily organized in those rural counties this time. The looming question is whether her campaign will be able to overcome the enthusiasm for Sanders, as well as a palpable level of discomfort with her position on gun control compared to Sanders' more moderate stances. \nAt a town hall in Elko Friday morning, Sanders stressed the importance of turnout among rural voters to his campaign, calling on them to show the world the desire for a \"political revolution that transforms this country.\"\n\"I really believe this from my heart of hearts: obviously we are here to win and hope to win. I want democracy to flourish,\" the Vermont senator said. \"I hope Nevada turns out -- I hope we have a YUGE turnout -- I'm afraid to use that word! But I hope we have a very, very large voter turnout. Show the world that democracy is alive and well in Nevada.\"\nCNN's Elizabeth Landers, Dan Merica and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","gunning_fog_5":"12.0","flesch_5":"13.0","readability_5":"46.1","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}},{"id":1952949333,"created_at":"2016-04-08T03:06:25+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T03:04:04+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NC","city":"Charlotte","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915125,"worker_id":36304114,"trust":0.65625,"worker_trust":0.825799532945687,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"0","q6":"1","q7":"-1","q8":"1","q9":"1","q10":"2","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"no_affiliation","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"19","index_1":"25","title_1":"Sanders, O'Malley criticize immigration raids at Iowa forum","url_1":"http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-01-09-US--DEM%202016/id-36d0b67119f64688ad1213e54f5495ef","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"the Associated Press","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)  Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley used a liberal forum in Iowa on Saturday to rail against holiday-season raids seeking Central American immigrants for deportation.\nBefore about 1,000 people packed into a Des Moines church, Sanders said that while he works closely with President Barack Obama, \"I do not agree with him on his policy toward deportation.\" And O'Malley bemoaned the timing of the raids, stating that \"Jesus himself was a refugee child.\"\nBoth candidates had previously criticized the raids, which first became public when The Washington Post published a story about the plans just before Christmas.\nThe White House defended the policies Friday.

Aides told CNN that Sanders received over 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.\nClinton's campaign announced Friday that it raised $37 million for the primary campaign in the last three months of 2015, easily surpassing the $100 million goal the campaign had set earlier in the year.\n\"This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,\" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement on Saturday. \"What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support.

I think that's ludicrous. What did he mean by that?\"\nJohn Markowski, a minister who was dropping his son off at a public school, said: \"It's insulting for anyone to make a derogatory comment about New York values. I think we pride ourselves on being a place of diversity and equality.\"\nDuring the debate, moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Cruz to explain past comments he had made about Trump embodying \"New York values.\"\n\"You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are,\" Cruz said.\n\"I am from New York. I don't,\" Bartiromo said.\nSo the GOP conservative explained: \"Listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.

Bashing the big city has long been a winning strategy in more conservative parts of the country, namely the Midwest and the South.\nNot a lot of New Yorkers have given money to Cruz's bid for the White House. His campaign took in only about $487,000 from New York contributors through Sept. 30, according to the most recent filings. But one New Yorker, Wall Street hedge fund mogul Robert Mercer, contributed $11 million last April to a super PAC that supports Cruz.\nCruz \"has no trouble taking money from New York City, but he's quick to insult our people and our values,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio, a liberal Democrat.","gunning_fog_4":"8.4","flesch_4":"8.4","readability_4":"63.7","index_5":"81","title_5":"Hillary Clinton hopes for strong Latino turnout in Nevada","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/nevada-caucus-democrats-2016/index.html","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Las Vegas (CNN) Bracing for another close race in a state that was once viewed as her firewall, Hillary Clinton is counting on a strong turnout among Latino voters in the Nevada caucuses Saturday to hold off Bernie Sanders' momentum in this critical swing state.\nWith polling showing a dead heat between Clinton and Sanders among likely caucusgoers, Clinton's surrogates fanned out across the Silver State this week, attempting to portray her as the more trustworthy candidate for Latinos as they work to ramp up participation by her supporters in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County.\nIn the final days, Clinton's allies have slashed Sanders' immigration record, criticizing him as a \"johnny-come-lately\" to the issue who has been too vague about his plans. At the same time, they have continued their push for Clinton in Nevada's rural counties -- where Clinton's canvassers have been pressing the case that Sanders' proposals are unrealistic and unachievable in the current political climate.\nA strong win would provide a jolt of momentum to Clinton heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.\nA loss, or even another close finish with Sanders in Nevada, would further chip away at the aura of electability that once surrounded her path to the nomination, serving as a testament to the strength of Sanders' momentum even in a heavily Latino state where she was organized six months ahead of him. \nAn estimated 40% of the state's Democratic voters are non-white -- and Clinton was expected to show her strength among minority voters with a good showing here. But Sanders has emphasized his family's immigrant roots here in ads and on the campaign trail, noting that his father was a Polish immigrant to America who originally spoke little English. \n\"Immigration isn't just a word for Bernie Sanders,\" the narrator said in one Spanish-language radio ad for his campaign in November. \"His story is the immigrant story.\" \nBeyond Clinton's breakneck campaign schedule here this week, there were other signs of concern within her campaign about the unexpected strength of the Sanders effort here.\nOn the same day that Clinton released an emotional immigration ad featuring Clinton talking to a tearful 10-year-old girl about the deportation letter that her parents received, her operatives added a half-million dollars to their ad spending on broadcast, satellite and cable for a total of $3.4 million to Sanders' $3.7 million, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising.\nThe Clinton campaign is also clearly looking at caucus states beyond Nevada, dispatching Bill Clinton to speak to voters in the upcoming contest of Colorado even as the post-caucus celebrations get underway in Nevada Saturday evening.\nClinton repeatedly dropped in on employees at the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in her efforts to boost Clark County turnout. Both campaigns had heavily courted the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which supported Obama in 2008 and helped him turn out voters to caucus. But in a blow to Clinton's campaign, they chose to stay neutral this year.\nStill, the former secretary of state greeted workers from that union during an overnight stop at Caesar's Palace Thursday after flying in from Chicago. Both she and her husband will visit the caucus site -- which is aimed at making it easier for Strip shift workers to participate during their work day -- at Caesar's Palace on Saturday afternoon while the caucus is underway.   \n\"I know you do a hard job,\" she told Caesar's Palace housekeeping workers during her overnight visit to their linen room. She said that when she arrived at the hotel, she had asked herself: \"Who is still working?\"\n\"A lot of people are,\" she said, before asking the workers to caucus for her at the hotel Saturday.\nLike Obama in 2008, Sanders is counting on a strong turnout from first-time caucusgoers, though not nearly as many are expected as eight years ago when some 120,000 turned out.\nThough Clinton is perceived as having an advantage with voters in Clark County, in part because of her strong support from labor unions, the Vermont senator spent a good amount of time campaigning around the populous areas of Las Vegas this week before heading to Elko, Nevada, on Friday to rally rural voters.\nDuring both an MSNBC forum and a speech at the Clark County Democratic Dinner on Thursday night, Sanders made a direct pitch to Latinos by chiding Donald Trump for vilifying immigrants. He argued that Congress \"must move towards a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\"\n\"While I understand that there are people who have differences of opinion with me on immigration reform, there is no justification, no reason, to resort to bigotry and xenophobia when we are talking about Mexicans or we are talking about Muslims,\" Sanders said at the Democratic dinner at the Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\"People can disagree about immigration reform, but in the year 2016, we will not allow the Trumps and others to divide us up and appeal to racism, which has done this country so much harm for so many years,\" he said.\nDuring the MSNBC/Telemundo forum, Sanders also defended his 2007 vote against legislation that would have revamped the immigration system, stating that he objected to guest-worker provisions that were described by one legal advocacy group as being \"akin to slavery.\"  \nBoth Sanders and Clinton have also made an aggressive play for Nevada's rural voters this cycle. Clinton won the popular vote here in 2008. But by organizing in the delegate-rich rural counties of Nevada, Obama won more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Clinton.\nClinton is heavily organized in those rural counties this time. The looming question is whether her campaign will be able to overcome the enthusiasm for Sanders, as well as a palpable level of discomfort with her position on gun control compared to Sanders' more moderate stances. \nAt a town hall in Elko Friday morning, Sanders stressed the importance of turnout among rural voters to his campaign, calling on them to show the world the desire for a \"political revolution that transforms this country.\"\n\"I really believe this from my heart of hearts: obviously we are here to win and hope to win. I want democracy to flourish,\" the Vermont senator said. \"I hope Nevada turns out -- I hope we have a YUGE turnout -- I'm afraid to use that word! But I hope we have a very, very large voter turnout. Show the world that democracy is alive and well in Nevada.\"\nCNN's Elizabeth Landers, Dan Merica and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","gunning_fog_5":"12.0","flesch_5":"13.0","readability_5":"46.1","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}},{"id":1952950590,"created_at":"2016-04-08T03:09:06+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T03:02:52+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"neodev","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"CA","city":"San Jose","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915125,"worker_id":34694174,"trust":0.645833333333333,"worker_trust":0.933333333333333,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"2","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"1","q4":"2","q5":"1","q6":"2","q7":"-1","q8":"1","q9":"1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"independent_other","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"19","index_1":"25","title_1":"Sanders, O'Malley criticize immigration raids at Iowa forum","url_1":"http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-01-09-US--DEM%202016/id-36d0b67119f64688ad1213e54f5495ef","candidate_1":"Bernie Sanders","org_1":"the Associated Press","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)  Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley used a liberal forum in Iowa on Saturday to rail against holiday-season raids seeking Central American immigrants for deportation.\nBefore about 1,000 people packed into a Des Moines church, Sanders said that while he works closely with President Barack Obama, \"I do not agree with him on his policy toward deportation.\" And O'Malley bemoaned the timing of the raids, stating that \"Jesus himself was a refugee child.\"\nBoth candidates had previously criticized the raids, which first became public when The Washington Post published a story about the plans just before Christmas.\nThe White House defended the policies Friday.

Aides told CNN that Sanders received over 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.\nClinton's campaign announced Friday that it raised $37 million for the primary campaign in the last three months of 2015, easily surpassing the $100 million goal the campaign had set earlier in the year.\n\"This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,\" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement on Saturday. \"What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support.

That is only $2 million more than the $26.2 million the campaign had in the bank at the end of the third quarter of 2015, meaning Sanders' operation spent the bulk of what they raised in the fourth quarter.\nMuch of that spending, according to aides, was focused on building infrastructure in early primary states, including deploying organizers to South Carolina and Nevada, and building the campaign's already existing organization in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nFor the year, Sanders' campaign spent 61% of the money it brought in.\n \nSanders has long been a formidable fundraiser with deep roots in online and small donor fundraising, but even some of his closest aides were unsure he could raise the money needed to run a presidential campaign when the launched earlier this year.

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took to the airwaves to denounce the candidate and demand an apology for comments he called \"obnoxious on every level.\"\nThe use of \"New York values\" as a term of abuse rankled plenty of city residents.\n\"Like that's a bad thing?\" said Willie Perry, a real estate salesman and registered Republican, as he headed to work in New York City. \"Actually it's a good thing. I think that's ludicrous. What did he mean by that?\"\nJohn Markowski, a minister who was dropping his son off at a public school, said: \"It's insulting for anyone to make a derogatory comment about New York values. I think we pride ourselves on being a place of diversity and equality.\"\nDuring the debate, moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Cruz to explain past comments he had made about Trump embodying \"New York values.\"\n\"You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are,\" Cruz said.\n\"I am from New York. I don't,\" Bartiromo said.\nSo the GOP conservative explained: \"Listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.\"\nTrump responded movingly by citing the city's response to 9/11.\n\"When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,\" he said to applause from the crowd in North Charleston, South Carolina. \"We rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.\"\nHe added: \"And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\"\nOne in 38 Americans lives in New York City, but the state's record of going for the Democrat in the winner-take-all electoral college system means Republicans rarely have to worry about insulting the populace. Bashing the big city has long been a winning strategy in more conservative parts of the country, namely the Midwest and the South.\nNot a lot of New Yorkers have given money to Cruz's bid for the White House. His campaign took in only about $487,000 from New York contributors through Sept. 30, according to the most recent filings. But one New Yorker, Wall Street hedge fund mogul Robert Mercer, contributed $11 million last April to a super PAC that supports Cruz.\nCruz \"has no trouble taking money from New York City, but he's quick to insult our people and our values,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio, a liberal Democrat.","gunning_fog_4":"8.4","flesch_4":"8.4","readability_4":"63.7","index_5":"81","title_5":"Hillary Clinton hopes for strong Latino turnout in Nevada","url_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/nevada-caucus-democrats-2016/index.html","candidate_5":"Hillary Clinton","org_5":"CNN","top_topic_5":"Immigration","body_5":"Las Vegas (CNN) Bracing for another close race in a state that was once viewed as her firewall, Hillary Clinton is counting on a strong turnout among Latino voters in the Nevada caucuses Saturday to hold off Bernie Sanders' momentum in this critical swing state.\nWith polling showing a dead heat between Clinton and Sanders among likely caucusgoers, Clinton's surrogates fanned out across the Silver State this week, attempting to portray her as the more trustworthy candidate for Latinos as they work to ramp up participation by her supporters in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County.\nIn the final days, Clinton's allies have slashed Sanders' immigration record, criticizing him as a \"johnny-come-lately\" to the issue who has been too vague about his plans. At the same time, they have continued their push for Clinton in Nevada's rural counties -- where Clinton's canvassers have been pressing the case that Sanders' proposals are unrealistic and unachievable in the current political climate.\nA strong win would provide a jolt of momentum to Clinton heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.\nA loss, or even another close finish with Sanders in Nevada, would further chip away at the aura of electability that once surrounded her path to the nomination, serving as a testament to the strength of Sanders' momentum even in a heavily Latino state where she was organized six months ahead of him. \nAn estimated 40% of the state's Democratic voters are non-white -- and Clinton was expected to show her strength among minority voters with a good showing here. But Sanders has emphasized his family's immigrant roots here in ads and on the campaign trail, noting that his father was a Polish immigrant to America who originally spoke little English. \n\"Immigration isn't just a word for Bernie Sanders,\" the narrator said in one Spanish-language radio ad for his campaign in November. \"His story is the immigrant story.\" \nBeyond Clinton's breakneck campaign schedule here this week, there were other signs of concern within her campaign about the unexpected strength of the Sanders effort here.\nOn the same day that Clinton released an emotional immigration ad featuring Clinton talking to a tearful 10-year-old girl about the deportation letter that her parents received, her operatives added a half-million dollars to their ad spending on broadcast, satellite and cable for a total of $3.4 million to Sanders' $3.7 million, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising.\nThe Clinton campaign is also clearly looking at caucus states beyond Nevada, dispatching Bill Clinton to speak to voters in the upcoming contest of Colorado even as the post-caucus celebrations get underway in Nevada Saturday evening.\nClinton repeatedly dropped in on employees at the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in her efforts to boost Clark County turnout. Both campaigns had heavily courted the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which supported Obama in 2008 and helped him turn out voters to caucus. But in a blow to Clinton's campaign, they chose to stay neutral this year.\nStill, the former secretary of state greeted workers from that union during an overnight stop at Caesar's Palace Thursday after flying in from Chicago. Both she and her husband will visit the caucus site -- which is aimed at making it easier for Strip shift workers to participate during their work day -- at Caesar's Palace on Saturday afternoon while the caucus is underway.   \n\"I know you do a hard job,\" she told Caesar's Palace housekeeping workers during her overnight visit to their linen room. She said that when she arrived at the hotel, she had asked herself: \"Who is still working?\"\n\"A lot of people are,\" she said, before asking the workers to caucus for her at the hotel Saturday.\nLike Obama in 2008, Sanders is counting on a strong turnout from first-time caucusgoers, though not nearly as many are expected as eight years ago when some 120,000 turned out.\nThough Clinton is perceived as having an advantage with voters in Clark County, in part because of her strong support from labor unions, the Vermont senator spent a good amount of time campaigning around the populous areas of Las Vegas this week before heading to Elko, Nevada, on Friday to rally rural voters.\nDuring both an MSNBC forum and a speech at the Clark County Democratic Dinner on Thursday night, Sanders made a direct pitch to Latinos by chiding Donald Trump for vilifying immigrants. He argued that Congress \"must move towards a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\"\n\"While I understand that there are people who have differences of opinion with me on immigration reform, there is no justification, no reason, to resort to bigotry and xenophobia when we are talking about Mexicans or we are talking about Muslims,\" Sanders said at the Democratic dinner at the Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\"People can disagree about immigration reform, but in the year 2016, we will not allow the Trumps and others to divide us up and appeal to racism, which has done this country so much harm for so many years,\" he said.\nDuring the MSNBC/Telemundo forum, Sanders also defended his 2007 vote against legislation that would have revamped the immigration system, stating that he objected to guest-worker provisions that were described by one legal advocacy group as being \"akin to slavery.\"  \nBoth Sanders and Clinton have also made an aggressive play for Nevada's rural voters this cycle. Clinton won the popular vote here in 2008. But by organizing in the delegate-rich rural counties of Nevada, Obama won more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Clinton.\nClinton is heavily organized in those rural counties this time. The looming question is whether her campaign will be able to overcome the enthusiasm for Sanders, as well as a palpable level of discomfort with her position on gun control compared to Sanders' more moderate stances. \nAt a town hall in Elko Friday morning, Sanders stressed the importance of turnout among rural voters to his campaign, calling on them to show the world the desire for a \"political revolution that transforms this country.\"\n\"I really believe this from my heart of hearts: obviously we are here to win and hope to win. I want democracy to flourish,\" the Vermont senator said. \"I hope Nevada turns out -- I hope we have a YUGE turnout -- I'm afraid to use that word! But I hope we have a very, very large voter turnout. Show the world that democracy is alive and well in Nevada.\"\nCNN's Elizabeth Landers, Dan Merica and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","gunning_fog_5":"12.0","flesch_5":"13.0","readability_5":"46.1","gold_title":"Bernie Sanders for President","gold_url":"http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/","gold_candidate":"Bernie Sanders","gold_org":"The Nation","gold_body":"A year ago, concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process, The Nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates, for the Democratic Party, and for democracy. Two months later, Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money. Sanders’s clarion call for fundamental reform—single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes—has inspired working people across the country. His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters, and his foreign policy, which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change, speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens. Most important, Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us. He has summoned the people to a “political revolution,” arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires.\n\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary—and that’s why we’re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president. This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary (we’ve done so only twice: for Jesse Jackson in 1988, and for Barack Obama in 2008). We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many. Americans are waking up to this reality, and they are demanding change. This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries, though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions.\n\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality, both economic and political. The United States has become a plutocracy—one in which, as Sanders puts it, “we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.” America’s middle class has melted away, while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes. The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared. Indeed, in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days—not prosperity, nor security, nor even responsibility. While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet’s destruction. While Americans have tired of endless war, the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country, damaged our reputation abroad, and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse. While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform, African-American men, women, and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets, and mass incarceration continues largely unabated.\n\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back. Seen in isolation, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter, the climate-justice movement, the immigrant-rights movement, the campaign for a financial-transactions tax, and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes. Taken together, they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy, while failing to meet the needs of the many. They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money, where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy.\n\nSenator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country. \nIn Bernie Sanders, these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion. In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division, the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity. We must turn to each other, not on each other, Sanders says, and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all. His campaign’s funding reflects this commitment, spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors. Thanks to his campaign’s integrity, Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud, irresistible demand for systemic political change.\n\nTHE US WANTS TO DEPORT THIS PALESTINIAN—BUT FIRST IT’D HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE\nFor over three decades, Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds, while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country’s increasingly downsized political map. As mayor of Burlington, he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city’s downtown area, submitting balanced budgets all the while. In the US House of Representatives, he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers. In the US Senate, he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses, wars of choice, the deregulation of banks, and bailouts for billionaires, and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades.\n\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president, we know his road to the White House remains steep. At press time, he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters, but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American, Latino, and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat said, his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition, and in Sanders, Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk: a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBT rights. And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn: Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account, reducing mass incarceration, and reforming discriminatory drug laws.\n\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. \nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn’t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo. Freed from these chains of special interest, he can take the bold measures that the country needs. Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; to invest in public education, from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms. He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage. He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy. His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn’t widen debate; rather, it narrows the range of possibility. While Sanders understands this, we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not.\n\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence, grit, and strength. She has responded to the populist temper of the times: questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy; courageously defending Planned Parenthood; challenging the National Rifle Association; and supporting trade unions. If nominated, she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination (and so would former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley). We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial, especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court. And there is no denying that if she were elected, Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women’s rights in a way that no other president has.\n\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear. Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to “get things done” in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed. Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age, and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all. She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks. We also fear that she might accept a budgetary “grand bargain” with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come.\n\nClinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong.\nOn foreign policy, Clinton is certainly seasoned, but her experience hasn’t prevented her from getting things wrong. Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq was a mistake, but she apparently learned little from it. Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya, leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base. She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria, an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war. She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone. Her support for President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms. If elected, Clinton will be another “war president” at a time when America desperately needs peace.\n\nSanders’s approach is different and better. The senator hasn’t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities, and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy. But what he has said (and done) inspires confidence. An opponent of the Iraq War from the start, he criticizes the notion of “regime change” and the presumption that America alone must police the world. He rejects a new Cold War with Russia. He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation. He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere. Sanders’s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home. He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession, and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change. And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America’s middle class.\n\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist (he is!) on a quixotic crusade. Meanwhile, the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign’s achievements, instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him. Nonetheless, polls show that Sanders—even as he still introduces himself to many voters—is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee, frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups. Moreover, in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton’s campaign stops, the huge crowds at Sanders’s grassroots rallies indicate that he’ll be able to boost turnout in November.\n\nWhether his candidacy, and the inspired campaign it fuels, will spark a “political revolution” sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen. We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible. This is a revolution that should live on, no matter who wins the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice. Theirs is an insurgency, a possibility, and a dream that we proudly endorse."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"g2":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.4343891402714933},"q1":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5656108597285068},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5656108597285068},"q3":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7149321266968326},"q4":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7194570135746607},"q5":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7149321266968326},"q6":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4343891402714933},"q7":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q8":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5656108597285068},"q9":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q10":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4343891402714933},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":1.0},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":0.5656108597285068},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":0.4343891402714933},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"bernie_sanders","confidence":0.5656108597285068}}}

Wade Dinner. \"So let's go make that happen and win on February 9.\"\nThe comment was the 2016 candidate's starkest assessment of the fact she is looking up at Sanders in the Granite State and a nod to the fact she lost Iowa in 2008 but won the New Hampshire primary a week later.\nA series of polls have shown the race in the New Hampshire primary favoring Sanders, the Vermont senator who has made a concerted effort to solidify his base in the state by spending over a month campaigning.

Of course it was going to happen. You just had to be patient. You just had to be strong.\n\nBut in the wake of his victories in New Hampshire and now South Carolina, the question is no longer “when.” It’s “if.” And the answer isn’t clear at all.\n\nConsider this: From 1980 forward, no Republican presidential candidate has won both the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries and gone on to lose the party’s nomination.\n\nAnd this: Over that same time period, only one Republican victor in South Carolina failed to become the nominee, and that was Newt Gingrich, in 2012. But Gingrich didn’t have Trump’s durable (and sizeable) lead in national polls. He didn’t dominate the race’s narrative and capture an exasperated electorate’s mood the way Trump has.\n\nAs it happens, Gingrich was on Fox News on Saturday night to discuss Trump’s latest triumph, and he didn’t say: “South Carolina? It’s a muggy, marshy, inconsequential tease. I bagged it four years ago and all it got me was this gig babbling in the wee hours about election returns.”\n\nNo, Gingrich marveled at what he made clear was “a huge night for Donald Trump.”\n\n“Nobody should kid themselves,” he added.\n\nTrump didn’t just win South Carolina, and he didn’t just win it by a margin of 10 points. He won it despite what looked, over recent days, like a concerted effort to lose it. He won it after what appeared to be one of the worst weeks that a candidate could have.\n\nIt began at the most recent debate, where he trashed the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and accused him of lying to the American people as he led them into war in Iraq. He sounded like a liberal Democrat. Republican primary voters, especially those in the South, aren’t typically receptive to that.\n\nOver the next days, Trump sounded even more like a liberal Democrat, at least as described by Ted Cruz, who went after him relentlessly, armed with Trump’s own past statements in support of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe week got messier from there. Trump picked a fight with the Pope. Trump picked a fight with Apple. It became evident that no personage or brand, no matter how beloved, was safe from his wrath. You had to wonder what or whom he’d go after next. Kittens? Betty Crocker? Betty White?\n\nThen Trump spoke up for a key aspect of Obamacare before realizing what he’d done and assuring everyone that he deplored every aspect of Obamacare, which paled in comparison with Trumpcare, whatever that might turn out to be.\n\nThis prompted extensive commentary on Trump’s inconsistencies and a fresh round of murmuring about an imminent tumble.\n\nBut what we incredulous political analysts keep failing to take into account—what I was reminded of when I went to a Trump rally last week and listened hard to his supporters—is that the people voting for him aren’t evaluating him through any usual ideological lens. They’re not asking what kind of Republican he is. They’re not troubling themselves with whether the position he’s selling today matches the position he was selling yesterday or even what that old position was.\n\nThey want to try something utterly different—utterly disruptive, to use the locution du jour—and that leaves them, on the Republican side, with the options of Trump and Ben Carson. Trump has the fire.\n\nOne woman told me that she loves the idea of a billionaire who is funding his own candidacy and won’t be beholden to contributors and special interests. Wouldn’t that be refreshing? Couldn’t that be transformative? Why not give it a shot?\n\nShe’d also been to a Marco Rubio rally and was impressed: what a nice young man. But she’s not in the market for nice and young, not this time around.\n\nAnother woman told me that she craves a president who is fearless, really fearless, and that of all the candidates in the race, Trump seems the least bowed, the least cowed. She trusts him to fight. All he does is fight. And a fight is what’s in order.\n\nA man who served in the Air Force and now works as a trucker told me that over several decades, through several presidents, the Veterans Administration has remained dysfunctional and his wages haven’t gone up. If he keeps voting the same way, for the same run-of-the-mill politicians, shouldn’t he expect more of the same? Trump isn’t the same.\n\nGingrich analyzed his appeal perfectly during that Fox News appearance. “It’s a very simple rule,” he said. “If you think Washington is so sick you want someone to kick over the kitchen table, then you like Donald Trump and you frankly don’t care about the details.”\n\nIn an exit poll of voters who participated in the Republican primary on Saturday, there was a near even split between those who said that the best preparation for the presidency was political experience and those who put more faith in someone from outside the political establishment. Rubio performed best with the former group, getting 38 percent of their votes. But Trump performed best with the latter group—and got 63 percent of theirs.\n\nGoing forward, Rubio is probably the bigger threat to Trump than Cruz, who won only 26 percent of South Carolina voters who identified themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians despite having campaigned as narrowly and relentlessly as possible for their favor. More of them chose Trump, who got 34 percent of the evangelical vote, and plenty of them chose Rubio, who got 21 percent.\n\nThat potentially spells trouble for Cruz in the Southern states on Super Tuesday that he’d hoped to dominate. Rubio, meanwhile, is better positioned than Cruz to pick up former supporters of Jeb Bush, who ended his candidacy Saturday night, and to compete well in states outside the South.\n\nAnd in the days and weeks to come, Rubio will get even more help and money than he has so far from Republican bigwigs who are desperate to see someone less truculent and divisive than Trump or Cruz burst into the lead.

As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also Republicans’ best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles.

Trump, who had kind words for Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina early in the week, ripped into her as weak on immigration on Wednesday after she endorsed Senator Marco Rubio, and the crowd of Trump supporters booed the mention of her name.\n\n“She’s very, very weak on illegal immigration,’’ Mr. Trump said, echoing earlier charges that were a departure from his gentler remarks about South Carolina’s governor in speeches this week. “Very weak,’’ he continued. “She’s very, very weak on illegal immigration. You can’t have that.’’\n\nMs. Haley, whose endorsement is a major boost for Mr. Rubio as Republicans head to the polls on Saturday, has served as a foil in Trump speeches ever since she urged voters last month to avoid “the angriest voices.” \n\nMr. Trump joyfully embraces his anger in most speeches as reflecting the mood of the country. In a speech in Greenville on Monday, he called Ms. Haley, who is popular with South Carolina Republicans, “a very nice woman” and “a friend of mine.’’ He said she had modified her original accusation that he was too angry, which she made in the official Republican response to President Obama’s State of the Union address. \n\nBy Wednesday night, Mr. Trump’s blandishments had changed. So had his audience’s mood. “You know, Nikki Haley gave a speech a couple of weeks ago and she said that we——’’ Mr. Trump began, waving an arm to include the crowd.  \n\nThere was a chorus of boos.  \n\n“It’s not good,’’ Mr. Trump said.

Wade Dinner. \"So let's go make that happen and win on February 9.\"\nThe comment was the 2016 candidate's starkest assessment of the fact she is looking up at Sanders in the Granite State and a nod to the fact she lost Iowa in 2008 but won the New Hampshire primary a week later.\nA series of polls have shown the race in the New Hampshire primary favoring Sanders, the Vermont senator who has made a concerted effort to solidify his base in the state by spending over a month campaigning. A CNN/WMUR poll released Tuesday found Sanders trouncing Clinton in the state, 60% to 33%.\nSanders has responded to his promising polls by arguing that the \"inevitable candidate ain't so inevitable today.\"\nClinton's comment came on her one day of campaigning in New Hampshire this week, as much of her time has been spent focused on Iowa.\nAlthough Clinton avoided directly hitting Sanders earlier in the day, she did comment on the fact that Sanders said earlier this week that groups like NARAL, Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign -- all organizations that endorsed Clinton -- were part of the \"establishment\" that he was running against. \n\"We need somebody in the Oval Office who really understands that NARAL and Planned Parenthood are not part of the establishment,\" Clinton said without mentioning Sanders, who backed away from his initial comments on Thursday.\nClinton devoted most of her speech to fighting for women's health and abortion rights. \nShe said people \"who are so adamantly opposed\" to abortion rights \"have no regard for what women's lives are like.\"\n\"I sometimes wonder whether those who are so adamantly opposed to the fundamental freedom to make your own choices on this most personal of issues are just unaware, ignorant, opportunistic, cynical,\" she said.\nAs she had before, Clinton also pledged to overturn the Hyde Amendment, a measure that bars the use of federal funds being spent on abortions in most cases. \"As president, I will fight to overturn it,\" she said to the receptive audience.","gunning_fog_2":"13.2","flesch_2":"13.0","readability_2":"51.52","index_3":"100","title_3":"Op-Ed Columnist: Is There Any Stopping Donald Trump?","url_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/opinion/is-there-any-stopping-donald-trump.html","candidate_3":"Donald Trump","org_3":"The New York Times","top_topic_3":"Abortion","body_3":"Over the last few months and even weeks, the question among many flabbergasted Republican traditionalists and incredulous political analysts was when the forces of gravity would catch up with Donald Trump and send him tumbling to earth.\n\nIt was going to happen. Of course it was going to happen. You just had to be patient. You just had to be strong.\n\nBut in the wake of his victories in New Hampshire and now South Carolina, the question is no longer “when.” It’s “if.” And the answer isn’t clear at all.\n\nConsider this: From 1980 forward, no Republican presidential candidate has won both the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries and gone on to lose the party’s nomination.\n\nAnd this: Over that same time period, only one Republican victor in South Carolina failed to become the nominee, and that was Newt Gingrich, in 2012. But Gingrich didn’t have Trump’s durable (and sizeable) lead in national polls. He didn’t dominate the race’s narrative and capture an exasperated electorate’s mood the way Trump has.\n\nAs it happens, Gingrich was on Fox News on Saturday night to discuss Trump’s latest triumph, and he didn’t say: “South Carolina? It’s a muggy, marshy, inconsequential tease. I bagged it four years ago and all it got me was this gig babbling in the wee hours about election returns.”\n\nNo, Gingrich marveled at what he made clear was “a huge night for Donald Trump.”\n\n“Nobody should kid themselves,” he added.\n\nTrump didn’t just win South Carolina, and he didn’t just win it by a margin of 10 points. He won it despite what looked, over recent days, like a concerted effort to lose it. He won it after what appeared to be one of the worst weeks that a candidate could have.\n\nIt began at the most recent debate, where he trashed the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and accused him of lying to the American people as he led them into war in Iraq. He sounded like a liberal Democrat. Republican primary voters, especially those in the South, aren’t typically receptive to that.\n\nOver the next days, Trump sounded even more like a liberal Democrat, at least as described by Ted Cruz, who went after him relentlessly, armed with Trump’s own past statements in support of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe week got messier from there. Trump picked a fight with the Pope. Trump picked a fight with Apple. It became evident that no personage or brand, no matter how beloved, was safe from his wrath. You had to wonder what or whom he’d go after next. Kittens? Betty Crocker? Betty White?\n\nThen Trump spoke up for a key aspect of Obamacare before realizing what he’d done and assuring everyone that he deplored every aspect of Obamacare, which paled in comparison with Trumpcare, whatever that might turn out to be.\n\nThis prompted extensive commentary on Trump’s inconsistencies and a fresh round of murmuring about an imminent tumble.\n\nBut what we incredulous political analysts keep failing to take into account—what I was reminded of when I went to a Trump rally last week and listened hard to his supporters—is that the people voting for him aren’t evaluating him through any usual ideological lens. They’re not asking what kind of Republican he is. They’re not troubling themselves with whether the position he’s selling today matches the position he was selling yesterday or even what that old position was.\n\nThey want to try something utterly different—utterly disruptive, to use the locution du jour—and that leaves them, on the Republican side, with the options of Trump and Ben Carson. Trump has the fire.\n\nOne woman told me that she loves the idea of a billionaire who is funding his own candidacy and won’t be beholden to contributors and special interests. Wouldn’t that be refreshing? Couldn’t that be transformative? Why not give it a shot?\n\nShe’d also been to a Marco Rubio rally and was impressed: what a nice young man. But she’s not in the market for nice and young, not this time around.\n\nAnother woman told me that she craves a president who is fearless, really fearless, and that of all the candidates in the race, Trump seems the least bowed, the least cowed. She trusts him to fight. All he does is fight. And a fight is what’s in order.\n\nA man who served in the Air Force and now works as a trucker told me that over several decades, through several presidents, the Veterans Administration has remained dysfunctional and his wages haven’t gone up. If he keeps voting the same way, for the same run-of-the-mill politicians, shouldn’t he expect more of the same? Trump isn’t the same.\n\nGingrich analyzed his appeal perfectly during that Fox News appearance. “It’s a very simple rule,” he said. “If you think Washington is so sick you want someone to kick over the kitchen table, then you like Donald Trump and you frankly don’t care about the details.”\n\nIn an exit poll of voters who participated in the Republican primary on Saturday, there was a near even split between those who said that the best preparation for the presidency was political experience and those who put more faith in someone from outside the political establishment. Rubio performed best with the former group, getting 38 percent of their votes. But Trump performed best with the latter group—and got 63 percent of theirs.\n\nGoing forward, Rubio is probably the bigger threat to Trump than Cruz, who won only 26 percent of South Carolina voters who identified themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians despite having campaigned as narrowly and relentlessly as possible for their favor. More of them chose Trump, who got 34 percent of the evangelical vote, and plenty of them chose Rubio, who got 21 percent.\n\nThat potentially spells trouble for Cruz in the Southern states on Super Tuesday that he’d hoped to dominate. Rubio, meanwhile, is better positioned than Cruz to pick up former supporters of Jeb Bush, who ended his candidacy Saturday night, and to compete well in states outside the South.\n\nAnd in the days and weeks to come, Rubio will get even more help and money than he has so far from Republican bigwigs who are desperate to see someone less truculent and divisive than Trump or Cruz burst into the lead. His South Carolina showing redeemed his New Hampshire embarrassment and renewed their faith.\n\nBut Rubio hasn’t notched a single victory yet. Trump has notched two, and whether they fully lived up to the advance polling is irrelevant. They’re victories, plural. They’re no fluke, no fad.\n\nNaysayers can’t claim that he’s just a bad gaffe or an ugly revelation away from doom. There have already been gaffes aplenty—if you can call them gaffes. There have been revelations galore.\n\nAll Trump’s fans see is someone barreling forward without apology and with a largeness that makes them feel a little less small. They see a winner.

We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative.

Of course it was going to happen. You just had to be patient. You just had to be strong.\n\nBut in the wake of his victories in New Hampshire and now South Carolina, the question is no longer “when.” It’s “if.” And the answer isn’t clear at all.\n\nConsider this: From 1980 forward, no Republican presidential candidate has won both the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries and gone on to lose the party’s nomination.\n\nAnd this: Over that same time period, only one Republican victor in South Carolina failed to become the nominee, and that was Newt Gingrich, in 2012. But Gingrich didn’t have Trump’s durable (and sizeable) lead in national polls. He didn’t dominate the race’s narrative and capture an exasperated electorate’s mood the way Trump has.\n\nAs it happens, Gingrich was on Fox News on Saturday night to discuss Trump’s latest triumph, and he didn’t say: “South Carolina? It’s a muggy, marshy, inconsequential tease. I bagged it four years ago and all it got me was this gig babbling in the wee hours about election returns.”\n\nNo, Gingrich marveled at what he made clear was “a huge night for Donald Trump.”\n\n“Nobody should kid themselves,” he added.\n\nTrump didn’t just win South Carolina, and he didn’t just win it by a margin of 10 points. He won it despite what looked, over recent days, like a concerted effort to lose it. He won it after what appeared to be one of the worst weeks that a candidate could have.\n\nIt began at the most recent debate, where he trashed the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and accused him of lying to the American people as he led them into war in Iraq. He sounded like a liberal Democrat. Republican primary voters, especially those in the South, aren’t typically receptive to that.\n\nOver the next days, Trump sounded even more like a liberal Democrat, at least as described by Ted Cruz, who went after him relentlessly, armed with Trump’s own past statements in support of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe week got messier from there. Trump picked a fight with the Pope. Trump picked a fight with Apple. It became evident that no personage or brand, no matter how beloved, was safe from his wrath. You had to wonder what or whom he’d go after next. Kittens? Betty Crocker? Betty White?\n\nThen Trump spoke up for a key aspect of Obamacare before realizing what he’d done and assuring everyone that he deplored every aspect of Obamacare, which paled in comparison with Trumpcare, whatever that might turn out to be.\n\nThis prompted extensive commentary on Trump’s inconsistencies and a fresh round of murmuring about an imminent tumble.\n\nBut what we incredulous political analysts keep failing to take into account—what I was reminded of when I went to a Trump rally last week and listened hard to his supporters—is that the people voting for him aren’t evaluating him through any usual ideological lens. They’re not asking what kind of Republican he is. They’re not troubling themselves with whether the position he’s selling today matches the position he was selling yesterday or even what that old position was.\n\nThey want to try something utterly different—utterly disruptive, to use the locution du jour—and that leaves them, on the Republican side, with the options of Trump and Ben Carson. Trump has the fire.\n\nOne woman told me that she loves the idea of a billionaire who is funding his own candidacy and won’t be beholden to contributors and special interests. Wouldn’t that be refreshing? Couldn’t that be transformative? Why not give it a shot?\n\nShe’d also been to a Marco Rubio rally and was impressed: what a nice young man. But she’s not in the market for nice and young, not this time around.\n\nAnother woman told me that she craves a president who is fearless, really fearless, and that of all the candidates in the race, Trump seems the least bowed, the least cowed. She trusts him to fight. All he does is fight. And a fight is what’s in order.\n\nA man who served in the Air Force and now works as a trucker told me that over several decades, through several presidents, the Veterans Administration has remained dysfunctional and his wages haven’t gone up. If he keeps voting the same way, for the same run-of-the-mill politicians, shouldn’t he expect more of the same? Trump isn’t the same.\n\nGingrich analyzed his appeal perfectly during that Fox News appearance. “It’s a very simple rule,” he said. “If you think Washington is so sick you want someone to kick over the kitchen table, then you like Donald Trump and you frankly don’t care about the details.”\n\nIn an exit poll of voters who participated in the Republican primary on Saturday, there was a near even split between those who said that the best preparation for the presidency was political experience and those who put more faith in someone from outside the political establishment. Rubio performed best with the former group, getting 38 percent of their votes. But Trump performed best with the latter group—and got 63 percent of theirs.\n\nGoing forward, Rubio is probably the bigger threat to Trump than Cruz, who won only 26 percent of South Carolina voters who identified themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians despite having campaigned as narrowly and relentlessly as possible for their favor. More of them chose Trump, who got 34 percent of the evangelical vote, and plenty of them chose Rubio, who got 21 percent.\n\nThat potentially spells trouble for Cruz in the Southern states on Super Tuesday that he’d hoped to dominate. Rubio, meanwhile, is better positioned than Cruz to pick up former supporters of Jeb Bush, who ended his candidacy Saturday night, and to compete well in states outside the South.\n\nAnd in the days and weeks to come, Rubio will get even more help and money than he has so far from Republican bigwigs who are desperate to see someone less truculent and divisive than Trump or Cruz burst into the lead. His South Carolina showing redeemed his New Hampshire embarrassment and renewed their faith.\n\nBut Rubio hasn’t notched a single victory yet. Trump has notched two, and whether they fully lived up to the advance polling is irrelevant. They’re victories, plural. They’re no fluke, no fad.\n\nNaysayers can’t claim that he’s just a bad gaffe or an ugly revelation away from doom. There have already been gaffes aplenty—if you can call them gaffes. There have been revelations galore.\n\nAll Trump’s fans see is someone barreling forward without apology and with a largeness that makes them feel a little less small. They see a winner. And it’s no longer an illusion.","gunning_fog_3":"8.4","flesch_3":"8.4","readability_3":"63.7","index_4":"23","title_4":"Sanders to release letter from his doctor before Iowa caucuses","url_4":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/bernie-sanders-health-records-doctor/index.html","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"CNN","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) Bernie Sanders will release a letter from his doctor before the Iowa caucuses on February 1, his campaign manager said Saturday.\nThe announcement comes after a Clinton-aligned super PAC suggested it would call on the 74-year-old Vermont senator to verify his health, and one day before the fourth Democratic debate, held in Charleston, South Carolina.\nThe letter, Jeff Weaver said, would prove Sanders -- the oldest candidate in the presidential field who also would be the oldest president to take office -- is in \"excellent health.\"\nThe Sanders campaign's decision came after David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton super PAC able to coordinate with the campaign, telegraphed his plans to call for the medical records this weekend here.\nPolitico first reported Brock's plans, and a source with knowledge of his plans confirmed his desire to call for the records in a conversation with CNN on Saturday. Brock, who once was a Clinton antagonist, is now a vocal Clinton defender and surrogate. \nThe Clinton campaign, despite being able to work with Brock, publicly rejected his plan to demand Sanders' records.\n\"Chill out,\" John Podesta, Clinton's campaign manager, tweeted at Brock. \"We're fighting on who would make a better President, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test.\"\nBrock's plans rankled Clinton's campaign aides, who, while happy to hit Sanders over policy, found the call to be distasteful. \n\"What the f***,\" a Clinton staffer mouthed when asked about the story. The staffer was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.\n \nClinton's campaign and Brock's super PAC, Correct the Record, began to coordinate in May in a move that many campaign finance experts said tested the limits of campaign laws. The groups cites a 2006 Federal Election Commission rule that states providing free content online for free -- and not producing ads -- is unable to be regulated.\nThere's some irony to Brock's call, as the 68-year-old Clinton has also come under scrutiny for her own health and age. \nBrock's plans have already been used as a fundraising tool by the Sanders campaign.\n\"With just two weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, the super PAC coordinating with Hillary Clinton's campaign is reportedly launching one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable: they are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,\" Weaver wrote in an email to supporters.\nHe added, \"Let me be very clear with you: Bernie is in excellent health.

Aides told CNN that Sanders received over 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.\nClinton's campaign announced Friday that it raised $37 million for the primary campaign in the last three months of 2015, easily surpassing the $100 million goal the campaign had set earlier in the year.\n\"This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,\" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement on Saturday. \"What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support. We are making history and we are proud of it.\" \nThe final quarter of 2015 also saw Sanders dramatically increase his spending. According to aides, the campaign ended 2015 with $28.4 million cash on hand. That is only $2 million more than the $26.2 million the campaign had in the bank at the end of the third quarter of 2015, meaning Sanders' operation spent the bulk of what they raised in the fourth quarter.\nMuch of that spending, according to aides, was focused on building infrastructure in early primary states, including deploying organizers to South Carolina and Nevada, and building the campaign's already existing organization in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nFor the year, Sanders' campaign spent 61% of the money it brought in.\n \nSanders has long been a formidable fundraiser with deep roots in online and small donor fundraising, but even some of his closest aides were unsure he could raise the money needed to run a presidential campaign when the launched earlier this year. Tad Devine, his top strategist, said that the operation had hoped to bring in between $40 and $50 million by the end of 2015.\nSanders smashed that goal, but in a dramatically different way than Clinton did.\nA bulk of Clinton's haul came from fundraisers she or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, personally headlined. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. And the former president headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter.\nAccording to CNN's analysis, fundraisers personally headlined by Clinton brought in at least $22 million in the forth quarter.\nSanders, however, only headlined two fundraisers in the last three months of 2015, bringing his year total to nine, while Clinton's total for the year was 174.\nWhat's more, almost all of Sanders' donors have yet to reach the $2,700 max donation, according to aides, who said Saturday that only around 600 Sanders supporters have maxed out.\nThat means Sanders' campaign can continue to hit up their donors for small donations as the primary calendar moves along.\nSanders' campaign has also raised big money at notable moments in the fourth quarter. Sanders' aides bragged that the campaign raised $2.5 million in the two days after the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas.\nAnd the day after the campaign breached the Clinton campaign's voter data -- and subsequently sued the Democratic National Committee -- aides said the campaign raised more than $1 million.","gunning_fog_5":"9.6","flesch_5":"9.5","readability_5":"60.65","gold_title":"Ted Cruz for President","gold_url":"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432682/ted-cruz-national-review-endorses-texas-senator-president","gold_candidate":"Ted Cruz","gold_org":"The National Review","gold_body":"Conservatives have had difficulty choosing a champion in the presidential race in part because it has featured so many candidates with very good claims on our support. As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial.

He won it despite what looked, over recent days, like a concerted effort to lose it. He won it after what appeared to be one of the worst weeks that a candidate could have.\n\nIt began at the most recent debate, where he trashed the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and accused him of lying to the American people as he led them into war in Iraq. He sounded like a liberal Democrat. Republican primary voters, especially those in the South, aren’t typically receptive to that.\n\nOver the next days, Trump sounded even more like a liberal Democrat, at least as described by Ted Cruz, who went after him relentlessly, armed with Trump’s own past statements in support of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe week got messier from there. Trump picked a fight with the Pope. Trump picked a fight with Apple. It became evident that no personage or brand, no matter how beloved, was safe from his wrath. You had to wonder what or whom he’d go after next. Kittens? Betty Crocker? Betty White?\n\nThen Trump spoke up for a key aspect of Obamacare before realizing what he’d done and assuring everyone that he deplored every aspect of Obamacare, which paled in comparison with Trumpcare, whatever that might turn out to be.\n\nThis prompted extensive commentary on Trump’s inconsistencies and a fresh round of murmuring about an imminent tumble.\n\nBut what we incredulous political analysts keep failing to take into account—what I was reminded of when I went to a Trump rally last week and listened hard to his supporters—is that the people voting for him aren’t evaluating him through any usual ideological lens. They’re not asking what kind of Republican he is. They’re not troubling themselves with whether the position he’s selling today matches the position he was selling yesterday or even what that old position was.\n\nThey want to try something utterly different—utterly disruptive, to use the locution du jour—and that leaves them, on the Republican side, with the options of Trump and Ben Carson. Trump has the fire.\n\nOne woman told me that she loves the idea of a billionaire who is funding his own candidacy and won’t be beholden to contributors and special interests. Wouldn’t that be refreshing? Couldn’t that be transformative? Why not give it a shot?\n\nShe’d also been to a Marco Rubio rally and was impressed: what a nice young man. But she’s not in the market for nice and young, not this time around.\n\nAnother woman told me that she craves a president who is fearless, really fearless, and that of all the candidates in the race, Trump seems the least bowed, the least cowed. She trusts him to fight. All he does is fight. And a fight is what’s in order.\n\nA man who served in the Air Force and now works as a trucker told me that over several decades, through several presidents, the Veterans Administration has remained dysfunctional and his wages haven’t gone up. If he keeps voting the same way, for the same run-of-the-mill politicians, shouldn’t he expect more of the same? Trump isn’t the same.\n\nGingrich analyzed his appeal perfectly during that Fox News appearance. “It’s a very simple rule,” he said. “If you think Washington is so sick you want someone to kick over the kitchen table, then you like Donald Trump and you frankly don’t care about the details.”\n\nIn an exit poll of voters who participated in the Republican primary on Saturday, there was a near even split between those who said that the best preparation for the presidency was political experience and those who put more faith in someone from outside the political establishment. Rubio performed best with the former group, getting 38 percent of their votes. But Trump performed best with the latter group—and got 63 percent of theirs.\n\nGoing forward, Rubio is probably the bigger threat to Trump than Cruz, who won only 26 percent of South Carolina voters who identified themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians despite having campaigned as narrowly and relentlessly as possible for their favor. More of them chose Trump, who got 34 percent of the evangelical vote, and plenty of them chose Rubio, who got 21 percent.\n\nThat potentially spells trouble for Cruz in the Southern states on Super Tuesday that he’d hoped to dominate. Rubio, meanwhile, is better positioned than Cruz to pick up former supporters of Jeb Bush, who ended his candidacy Saturday night, and to compete well in states outside the South.\n\nAnd in the days and weeks to come, Rubio will get even more help and money than he has so far from Republican bigwigs who are desperate to see someone less truculent and divisive than Trump or Cruz burst into the lead. His South Carolina showing redeemed his New Hampshire embarrassment and renewed their faith.\n\nBut Rubio hasn’t notched a single victory yet. Trump has notched two, and whether they fully lived up to the advance polling is irrelevant. They’re victories, plural. They’re no fluke, no fad.\n\nNaysayers can’t claim that he’s just a bad gaffe or an ugly revelation away from doom. There have already been gaffes aplenty—if you can call them gaffes. There have been revelations galore.\n\nAll Trump’s fans see is someone barreling forward without apology and with a largeness that makes them feel a little less small. They see a winner. And it’s no longer an illusion.","gunning_fog_3":"8.4","flesch_3":"8.4","readability_3":"63.7","index_4":"23","title_4":"Sanders to release letter from his doctor before Iowa caucuses","url_4":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/bernie-sanders-health-records-doctor/index.html","candidate_4":"Bernie Sanders","org_4":"CNN","top_topic_4":"Campaign Finance","body_4":"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) Bernie Sanders will release a letter from his doctor before the Iowa caucuses on February 1, his campaign manager said Saturday.\nThe announcement comes after a Clinton-aligned super PAC suggested it would call on the 74-year-old Vermont senator to verify his health, and one day before the fourth Democratic debate, held in Charleston, South Carolina.\nThe letter, Jeff Weaver said, would prove Sanders -- the oldest candidate in the presidential field who also would be the oldest president to take office -- is in \"excellent health.\"\nThe Sanders campaign's decision came after David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton super PAC able to coordinate with the campaign, telegraphed his plans to call for the medical records this weekend here.\nPolitico first reported Brock's plans, and a source with knowledge of his plans confirmed his desire to call for the records in a conversation with CNN on Saturday. Brock, who once was a Clinton antagonist, is now a vocal Clinton defender and surrogate. \nThe Clinton campaign, despite being able to work with Brock, publicly rejected his plan to demand Sanders' records.\n\"Chill out,\" John Podesta, Clinton's campaign manager, tweeted at Brock. \"We're fighting on who would make a better President, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test.\"\nBrock's plans rankled Clinton's campaign aides, who, while happy to hit Sanders over policy, found the call to be distasteful. \n\"What the f***,\" a Clinton staffer mouthed when asked about the story. The staffer was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.\n \nClinton's campaign and Brock's super PAC, Correct the Record, began to coordinate in May in a move that many campaign finance experts said tested the limits of campaign laws. The groups cites a 2006 Federal Election Commission rule that states providing free content online for free -- and not producing ads -- is unable to be regulated.\nThere's some irony to Brock's call, as the 68-year-old Clinton has also come under scrutiny for her own health and age. \nBrock's plans have already been used as a fundraising tool by the Sanders campaign.\n\"With just two weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, the super PAC coordinating with Hillary Clinton's campaign is reportedly launching one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable: they are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,\" Weaver wrote in an email to supporters.\nHe added, \"Let me be very clear with you: Bernie is in excellent health.

Aides told CNN that Sanders received over 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.\nClinton's campaign announced Friday that it raised $37 million for the primary campaign in the last three months of 2015, easily surpassing the $100 million goal the campaign had set earlier in the year.\n\"This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,\" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement on Saturday. \"What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support. We are making history and we are proud of it.\" \nThe final quarter of 2015 also saw Sanders dramatically increase his spending. According to aides, the campaign ended 2015 with $28.4 million cash on hand. That is only $2 million more than the $26.2 million the campaign had in the bank at the end of the third quarter of 2015, meaning Sanders' operation spent the bulk of what they raised in the fourth quarter.\nMuch of that spending, according to aides, was focused on building infrastructure in early primary states, including deploying organizers to South Carolina and Nevada, and building the campaign's already existing organization in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nFor the year, Sanders' campaign spent 61% of the money it brought in.\n \nSanders has long been a formidable fundraiser with deep roots in online and small donor fundraising, but even some of his closest aides were unsure he could raise the money needed to run a presidential campaign when the launched earlier this year. Tad Devine, his top strategist, said that the operation had hoped to bring in between $40 and $50 million by the end of 2015.\nSanders smashed that goal, but in a dramatically different way than Clinton did.\nA bulk of Clinton's haul came from fundraisers she or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, personally headlined. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. And the former president headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter.\nAccording to CNN's analysis, fundraisers personally headlined by Clinton brought in at least $22 million in the forth quarter.\nSanders, however, only headlined two fundraisers in the last three months of 2015, bringing his year total to nine, while Clinton's total for the year was 174.\nWhat's more, almost all of Sanders' donors have yet to reach the $2,700 max donation, according to aides, who said Saturday that only around 600 Sanders supporters have maxed out.\nThat means Sanders' campaign can continue to hit up their donors for small donations as the primary calendar moves along.\nSanders' campaign has also raised big money at notable moments in the fourth quarter. Sanders' aides bragged that the campaign raised $2.5 million in the two days after the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas.\nAnd the day after the campaign breached the Clinton campaign's voter data -- and subsequently sued the Democratic National Committee -- aides said the campaign raised more than $1 million.","gunning_fog_5":"9.6","flesch_5":"9.5","readability_5":"60.65","gold_title":"Ted Cruz for President","gold_url":"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432682/ted-cruz-national-review-endorses-texas-senator-president","gold_candidate":"Ted Cruz","gold_org":"The National Review","gold_body":"Conservatives have had difficulty choosing a champion in the presidential race in part because it has featured so many candidates with very good claims on our support. As their number has dwindled, the right choice has become clear: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. We supported Cruz’s campaign in 2012 because we saw in him what conservatives nationwide have come to see as well. Cruz is a brilliant and articulate exponent of our views on the full spectrum of issues. Other Republicans say we should protect the Constitution. Cruz has actually done it; indeed, it has been the animating passion of his career. He is a strong believer in the liberating power of free markets, including free trade (notwithstanding the usual rhetorical hedges). His skepticism about “comprehensive immigration reform” is leading him to a realism about the impact of immigration that has been missing from our policymaking and debate. He favors a foreign policy based on a hard-headed assessment of American interests, one that seeks to strengthen our power but is mindful of its limits. He forthrightly defends religious liberty, the right to life of unborn children, and the role of marriage in connecting children to their parents — causes that reduce too many other Republicans to mumbling. That forthrightness is worth emphasizing. Conservatism should not be merely combative; but especially in our political culture, it must be willing to be controversial. Too many Republicans shrink from this implication of our creed. Not Cruz. And this virtue is connected to others that primary voters should keep in mind. Conservatives need not worry that Cruz will be tripped up by an interview question, or answer it with mindless conventional wisdom when a better answer is available. We need rarely worry, either, that his stumbling words will have to be recast by aides and supporters later. Neither of those things could be said about a lot of Republican nominees over the years. We are well aware that a lot of Republicans, and even some conservatives, dislike the senator and even find him unlikable. So far, conservative voters seem to like him just fine. We do not wish to adjudicate all the conflicts between Cruz’s Senate colleagues and him. He has sometimes made tactical errors, in our judgment; but conflicts have also arisen because his colleagues have lacked direction, clarity, and urgency. In any case, these conflicts pale into insignificance in light of Republicans’ shared interest in winning in November and governing successfully thereafter. No politician is perfect, and Senator Cruz will find that our endorsement comes with friendly and ongoing criticism. His tax plan is admirably growth-oriented but contains too much indirect taxation of employees. He has done little to lay out a plausible replacement for Obamacare, and especially to counter the idea that replacing it would involve stripping insurance from millions of Americans. His occasional remarks to the effect that the general election can be won by mobilizing conservatives who have been heretofore quiescent politically seems fanciful. As the nominee he will have to adopt a more empirically grounded strategy, just as he has done in the primaries. What matters now is that Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also Republicans’ best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles. We support Ted Cruz for president."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6972477064220183},"g2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.6972477064220183},"q1":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.743119266055046},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5596330275229358},"q3":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4403669724770643},"q4":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6972477064220183},"q5":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.743119266055046},"q6":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q7":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.4403669724770643},"q8":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.6972477064220183},"q9":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.743119266055046},"q10":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.743119266055046},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":0.5596330275229358},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"3049","confidence":0.6972477064220183},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":1.0},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"hillary_clinton","confidence":0.5596330275229358}}}

Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham gave $1 million. Texas trial lawyer and prominent Democratic donor Steve Mostyn added $1 million.\nClinton herself added to that financial advantage over Sanders -- who does not have an authorized super PAC -- with a $14.9 million haul for her campaign. She had nearly $33 million on hand as of Jan. 31. Priorities USA Action had nearly $45 million in cash on hand at the end of January.\nSanders' campaign outraised Clinton's campaign in January though, raising $21.3 million. His campaign now claims more than 4 million individual donors and does not have an official super PAC.\n\nOn the Republican side, Ted Cruz had substantially more money on hand at the end of January than the other GOP candidates still in the race. The day before Cruz won Iowa, he had $13.6 million, while candidates like John Kasich only had under $1.5 million.\nSome Republican super PACs reported additional seven-digit donations on Saturday: Oracle executive Larry Ellison gave $1 million in January to Marco Rubio's group, and a Texas LLC called Trinity Equity, with some ties to Cruz megadonor and close friend Toby Neugebauer, contributed $1 million to Cruz super PAC, Stand for Truth. \nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had a less-than-stellar fundraising month. Having come up short in Iowa and New Hampshire, his super PAC raised $320,000 in all of January.

It also plans to report to the Federal Election Commission that it raised $33.6 million in the last three months of 2015.\nAll campaigns and super PACs must file their 2015 reports with the FEC by the end of Sunday. Some are in good shape and will hype their numbers, especially their cash-on-hand heading into the month, in order to instill donor confidence in their campaign's ability to go the distance. \nSunday is also the first chance in six months to see what how much big donors are giving to super PACs, the outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash to help candidates. \nHillary Clinton's top super PAC, Priorities USA, said Friday it has raised $50 million through this month, with another $42 million in pledges. Clinton's campaign also announced it had $38 million on hand as of the end of the year.\nAnd while Sanders, who has sworn off super PACs, a group run by National Nurses United is backing the Vermont senator and has raised $2.3 million, with about half of that remaining, the group reported.\n\nThe best funded group of all, as of Sunday early afternoon, is Marco Rubio's super PAC, which raised nearly $16 million in the second half of 2015 and had about $14 million on hand.\nSeveral individuals gave $1 million to the group, including Norman Braman, a Rubio mentor from Florida who has now given a total of $6 million to the super PAC. And two new billionaire donors to Rubio's circle, Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, each gave $2.5 million to the super PAC.\n\nThe super PACs supporting Ben Carson and Rand Paul are poor, while the outside groups supporting Chris Christie and Ted Cruz are relatively rich, new campaign finance filings show.\nCarson's main super PAC, The 2016 Committee, raised $6.1 million in the second half of 2016, but spent nearly all its money and retained only $560,000 as of December 31. And Rand Paul's authorized group, America's Liberty PAC, has been beset by scandal -- its top two operatives were once indicted -- and now has poor fundraising results: it only collected $1.4 million, with only about $830,000 on hand.\nOther groups are in stronger position: Christie's group, America Leads, raised $5.1 million thanks to prominent hedge-funder Steve Cohen, who sank another $2 million to the super PAC. It still had $3.3 million on hand. \nStand for Truth, a mysterious pro-Cruz super PAC that formed only recently, revealed its donors on Sunday -- nearly half of the money raised by it came from the family of Adam Ross, a close Cruz friend from Texas.

There will be tax increases on Wall Street, big businesses and the “super-rich,” the ad goes on to say. \n\nThe spot is expected to be backed by $600,000 in spending on television ads, and there will be additional expenditures on radio and digital advertising. \n\nMr. Ricketts has been a major Republican donor this cycle in the presidential race, but with the ad, his group is injecting itself into the Democratic nominating contest.\n\n“When it comes to federal spending and piling on our massive debt, Secretary Clinton is a five-car pile-up, but Senator Sanders is a trainwreck,” said Brian Baker, the president of the ESA Fund. “Given that Senator Sanders is the leading candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire and way ahead in the general election polls, ESAFund will work hard to inform voters about his record and future plans.” Mr. Sanders leads in many head- many national polls.\n\nESA Fund is the affiliated super PAC of Ending Spending, which was founded by Mr. Ricketts and is operated by his son, Todd Ricketts, who is on the board of the Chicago Cubs. It is laser-trained on fighting what it considers excess spending by the government. \n\nThe elder Mr. Ricketts gave $5 million to the super PAC that backed Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race last fall. And Todd Ricketts helped run Mr. Walker’s national fundraising efforts for his campaign. \n\nMichael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said he had not seen the ad but added, “Are they against strengthening Social Security? Raising the minimum wage? Don’t they want to make college affordable? Do they like Wall Street and big banks? Do they want to keep tax loopholes that let profitable corporations evade taxes?”\n\nDespite the current general election match-ups in public polling, Mr. Sanders is far less known nationally than Hillary Clinton, meaning his negative ratings are lower. \n\nThe strategy of attacking Mr. Sanders seems reminiscent of how Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a Democrat, ran ads targeting Todd Akin, a conservative and the opponent she most wanted to face because he seemed less electable in a general election. That is also the bar that Mr. Sanders has been fighting to clear.","gunning_fog_3":"8.0","flesch_3":"8.0","readability_3":"64.71","index_4":"101","title_4":"Donald Trump and the Art of the Mideast Peace Deal","url_4":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/22/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-mideast-peace-deal/","candidate_4":"Donald Trump","org_4":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_4":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_4":"Aaron David Miller is a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars and most recently the author of The End of Greatness: Why America Cant Have (and Doesnt Want) Another Great President. He is on Twitter: @AaronDMiller2.\nPresidential elections produce stunning bursts of pro-Israel sentiment and support from candidates of both political parties.\nThis year the fraught relationship between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Iran nuclear deal, and candidates’ desire to be on the right side of the angels on this issue have led to particularly intense pro-Israel rhetoric.\nSen. Marco Rubio routinely uses the biblical terminology Judea and Samaria to refer to the West Bank; Sen. Ted Cruz promises to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to tear up the Iran nuclear agreement if elected president; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before he dropped out of the race on Saturday said he would restore the trust with Israel that the Obama administration had destroyed; and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledges that “with every passing year we must tie the bonds tighter,” and has promised that she would take the U.S.-Israeli relationship to “the next level.”\nAmid all this is an outlier: Donald Trump’s rhetoric is decidedly less effusive and his tone much cooler and more detached than his rivals when it comes to Israel and Jewish issues. One might expect Mr. Trump, a New York real estate and business magnate with deep contacts and friendships in the Jewish community, to be noisier and louder on Israel than all the other Republican candidates. He has made positive statements –Ive devoted so much time over my life to Israel,” and The other politicians, they can talk, but believe me, they havent done what Ive done.–but compared to his GOP rivals Mr. Trump has been strikingly low key on this subject.\nMr. Trump was booed at a December meeting of the Republican National Jewish Coalition for not promising, if elected president, that he would move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, though last month he reversed his position. Such pledges are standard fare for Republicans and even some Democrats, but Mr. Trump initially dodged the question.\nIn a December interview, Mr. Trump wondered aloud whether Israels and Palestinians want to make peace.\nA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal–whether or not Israels willing to sacrifice certain things, he said.\nInstead of blasting the Palestinians in ways that have become routine political talking points, Mr. Trump demonstrated a kind of negotiators detachment. And in contrast to other GOP candidates, Mr. Trump described Israeli housing projects–presumably he meant settlements in the West Bank–as a huge sticking point in negotiating any deal.\nDuring last week’s MSNBC town hall meeting in South Carolina, Mr. Trump declined to say whether Israelis or Palestinians were to blame for the violent clashes. If I win, I dont want to be in a position where Im saying to you, and the other side now says, We dont want Trump involved, we dont want… Let me be sort of a neutral guy, lets see whatIm going to give it a shot. It would be so great.\nWhat explains Mr. Trumps coolness in a campaign where hotly touting pro-Israel credentials is par for the course? Is it his self-confidence? He told the Republican Jewish Coalition, “you’re going to love where I am on Israel.”\nIs he such a self-financed maverick that he doesnt care about Republican Jewish support and has no intention of pandering? Youre not going to support me,” he told a gathering of Republican Jews, even though Ill be the best guy for Israel.”\nOr could the driving factor be that Mr. Trump would love to try to make a deal between Israel and the Palestinians? He has expressed his interest and enthusiasm for this several times. Striking a deal “would be a really great achievement,” because theres been “so much death, so much turmoil, so much hatred.”\nHe told the Associated Press that getting a deal to end the prolonged conflict is “something I’d really like to do.” Is it possible that to preserve his credibility as a mediator, Mr. Trump purposefully avoids adopting positions that might prejudice success in a future negotiation?\nMr. Trumps posture on Israel represents an intriguing bit of unpredictability on a politically sensitive issue about which most of his rivals are quite predictable. It’s fascinating that on almost every issue, he is brash and bold, yet on such a diplomatically sensitive issue as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he is circumspect and careful. Mr. Trump frequently cites his consummate skill as a negotiator.\nCould it be that the author of “The Art of the Deal” believes he can achieve what no U.S. president or secretary of state has accomplished — brokering an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians?","gunning_fog_4":"8.4","flesch_4":"8.4","readability_4":"63.7","index_5":"26","title_5":"Ben & Jerry Serve Ice Cream to Voters at N.H.

Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor).

As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.

It also plans to report to the Federal Election Commission that it raised $33.6 million in the last three months of 2015.\nAll campaigns and super PACs must file their 2015 reports with the FEC by the end of Sunday. Some are in good shape and will hype their numbers, especially their cash-on-hand heading into the month, in order to instill donor confidence in their campaign's ability to go the distance. \nSunday is also the first chance in six months to see what how much big donors are giving to super PACs, the outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash to help candidates. \nHillary Clinton's top super PAC, Priorities USA, said Friday it has raised $50 million through this month, with another $42 million in pledges. Clinton's campaign also announced it had $38 million on hand as of the end of the year.\nAnd while Sanders, who has sworn off super PACs, a group run by National Nurses United is backing the Vermont senator and has raised $2.3 million, with about half of that remaining, the group reported.\n\nThe best funded group of all, as of Sunday early afternoon, is Marco Rubio's super PAC, which raised nearly $16 million in the second half of 2015 and had about $14 million on hand.\nSeveral individuals gave $1 million to the group, including Norman Braman, a Rubio mentor from Florida who has now given a total of $6 million to the super PAC. And two new billionaire donors to Rubio's circle, Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, each gave $2.5 million to the super PAC.\n\nThe super PACs supporting Ben Carson and Rand Paul are poor, while the outside groups supporting Chris Christie and Ted Cruz are relatively rich, new campaign finance filings show.\nCarson's main super PAC, The 2016 Committee, raised $6.1 million in the second half of 2016, but spent nearly all its money and retained only $560,000 as of December 31. And Rand Paul's authorized group, America's Liberty PAC, has been beset by scandal -- its top two operatives were once indicted -- and now has poor fundraising results: it only collected $1.4 million, with only about $830,000 on hand.\nOther groups are in stronger position: Christie's group, America Leads, raised $5.1 million thanks to prominent hedge-funder Steve Cohen, who sank another $2 million to the super PAC. It still had $3.3 million on hand. \nStand for Truth, a mysterious pro-Cruz super PAC that formed only recently, revealed its donors on Sunday -- nearly half of the money raised by it came from the family of Adam Ross, a close Cruz friend from Texas.

There will be tax increases on Wall Street, big businesses and the “super-rich,” the ad goes on to say. \n\nThe spot is expected to be backed by $600,000 in spending on television ads, and there will be additional expenditures on radio and digital advertising. \n\nMr. Ricketts has been a major Republican donor this cycle in the presidential race, but with the ad, his group is injecting itself into the Democratic nominating contest.\n\n“When it comes to federal spending and piling on our massive debt, Secretary Clinton is a five-car pile-up, but Senator Sanders is a trainwreck,” said Brian Baker, the president of the ESA Fund. “Given that Senator Sanders is the leading candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire and way ahead in the general election polls, ESAFund will work hard to inform voters about his record and future plans.” Mr. Sanders leads in many head- many national polls.\n\nESA Fund is the affiliated super PAC of Ending Spending, which was founded by Mr. Ricketts and is operated by his son, Todd Ricketts, who is on the board of the Chicago Cubs. It is laser-trained on fighting what it considers excess spending by the government. \n\nThe elder Mr. Ricketts gave $5 million to the super PAC that backed Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race last fall. And Todd Ricketts helped run Mr. Walker’s national fundraising efforts for his campaign. \n\nMichael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said he had not seen the ad but added, “Are they against strengthening Social Security? Raising the minimum wage? Don’t they want to make college affordable? Do they like Wall Street and big banks? Do they want to keep tax loopholes that let profitable corporations evade taxes?”\n\nDespite the current general election match-ups in public polling, Mr. Sanders is far less known nationally than Hillary Clinton, meaning his negative ratings are lower. \n\nThe strategy of attacking Mr. Sanders seems reminiscent of how Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a Democrat, ran ads targeting Todd Akin, a conservative and the opponent she most wanted to face because he seemed less electable in a general election. That is also the bar that Mr. Sanders has been fighting to clear.","gunning_fog_3":"8.0","flesch_3":"8.0","readability_3":"64.71","index_4":"101","title_4":"Donald Trump and the Art of the Mideast Peace Deal","url_4":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/22/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-mideast-peace-deal/","candidate_4":"Donald Trump","org_4":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_4":"Foreign Policy/National Security","body_4":"Aaron David Miller is a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars and most recently the author of The End of Greatness: Why America Cant Have (and Doesnt Want) Another Great President. He is on Twitter: @AaronDMiller2.\nPresidential elections produce stunning bursts of pro-Israel sentiment and support from candidates of both political parties.\nThis year the fraught relationship between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Iran nuclear deal, and candidates’ desire to be on the right side of the angels on this issue have led to particularly intense pro-Israel rhetoric.\nSen. Marco Rubio routinely uses the biblical terminology Judea and Samaria to refer to the West Bank; Sen. Ted Cruz promises to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to tear up the Iran nuclear agreement if elected president; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before he dropped out of the race on Saturday said he would restore the trust with Israel that the Obama administration had destroyed; and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledges that “with every passing year we must tie the bonds tighter,” and has promised that she would take the U.S.-Israeli relationship to “the next level.”\nAmid all this is an outlier: Donald Trump’s rhetoric is decidedly less effusive and his tone much cooler and more detached than his rivals when it comes to Israel and Jewish issues. One might expect Mr. Trump, a New York real estate and business magnate with deep contacts and friendships in the Jewish community, to be noisier and louder on Israel than all the other Republican candidates. He has made positive statements –Ive devoted so much time over my life to Israel,” and The other politicians, they can talk, but believe me, they havent done what Ive done.–but compared to his GOP rivals Mr. Trump has been strikingly low key on this subject.\nMr. Trump was booed at a December meeting of the Republican National Jewish Coalition for not promising, if elected president, that he would move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, though last month he reversed his position. Such pledges are standard fare for Republicans and even some Democrats, but Mr. Trump initially dodged the question.\nIn a December interview, Mr. Trump wondered aloud whether Israels and Palestinians want to make peace.\nA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal–whether or not Israels willing to sacrifice certain things, he said.\nInstead of blasting the Palestinians in ways that have become routine political talking points, Mr. Trump demonstrated a kind of negotiators detachment. And in contrast to other GOP candidates, Mr. Trump described Israeli housing projects–presumably he meant settlements in the West Bank–as a huge sticking point in negotiating any deal.\nDuring last week’s MSNBC town hall meeting in South Carolina, Mr. Trump declined to say whether Israelis or Palestinians were to blame for the violent clashes. If I win, I dont want to be in a position where Im saying to you, and the other side now says, We dont want Trump involved, we dont want… Let me be sort of a neutral guy, lets see whatIm going to give it a shot. It would be so great.\nWhat explains Mr. Trumps coolness in a campaign where hotly touting pro-Israel credentials is par for the course? Is it his self-confidence? He told the Republican Jewish Coalition, “you’re going to love where I am on Israel.”\nIs he such a self-financed maverick that he doesnt care about Republican Jewish support and has no intention of pandering? Youre not going to support me,” he told a gathering of Republican Jews, even though Ill be the best guy for Israel.”\nOr could the driving factor be that Mr. Trump would love to try to make a deal between Israel and the Palestinians? He has expressed his interest and enthusiasm for this several times. Striking a deal “would be a really great achievement,” because theres been “so much death, so much turmoil, so much hatred.”\nHe told the Associated Press that getting a deal to end the prolonged conflict is “something I’d really like to do.” Is it possible that to preserve his credibility as a mediator, Mr. Trump purposefully avoids adopting positions that might prejudice success in a future negotiation?\nMr. Trumps posture on Israel represents an intriguing bit of unpredictability on a politically sensitive issue about which most of his rivals are quite predictable. It’s fascinating that on almost every issue, he is brash and bold, yet on such a diplomatically sensitive issue as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he is circumspect and careful. Mr. Trump frequently cites his consummate skill as a negotiator.\nCould it be that the author of “The Art of the Deal” believes he can achieve what no U.S. president or secretary of state has accomplished — brokering an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians?","gunning_fog_4":"8.4","flesch_4":"8.4","readability_4":"63.7","index_5":"26","title_5":"Ben & Jerry Serve Ice Cream to Voters at N.H.

And two new billionaire donors to Rubio's circle, Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, each gave $2.5 million to the super PAC.\n\nThe super PACs supporting Ben Carson and Rand Paul are poor, while the outside groups supporting Chris Christie and Ted Cruz are relatively rich, new campaign finance filings show.\nCarson's main super PAC, The 2016 Committee, raised $6.1 million in the second half of 2016, but spent nearly all its money and retained only $560,000 as of December 31. And Rand Paul's authorized group, America's Liberty PAC, has been beset by scandal -- its top two operatives were once indicted -- and now has poor fundraising results: it only collected $1.4 million, with only about $830,000 on hand.\nOther groups are in stronger position: Christie's group, America Leads, raised $5.1 million thanks to prominent hedge-funder Steve Cohen, who sank another $2 million to the super PAC. It still had $3.3 million on hand. \nStand for Truth, a mysterious pro-Cruz super PAC that formed only recently, revealed its donors on Sunday -- nearly half of the money raised by it came from the family of Adam Ross, a close Cruz friend from Texas.

That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}},{"id":1952877249,"created_at":"2016-04-08T00:41:43+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T00:28:58+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"prodege","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"OK","city":"Edmond","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915128,"worker_id":33565158,"trust":0.645833333333333,"worker_trust":0.953142857142857,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"1","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"-1","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"0","q9":"1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"22","index_1":"65","title_1":"Clinton super PAC gets big donor boost","url_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/clinton-campaign-donations-super-pac/index.html","candidate_1":"Hillary Clinton","org_1":"CNN","top_topic_1":"Campaign Finance","body_1":"(CNN) Hillary Clinton's super PAC collected more than $9.5 million in January, more than half of which came from five wealthy donors.\nPriorities USA Action earned a $3.5 million check from James Simons, a New York City hedge fund manager and philanthropist on Jan. 11, the group told the Federal Election Commission in a filing on Saturday. \nJay and Mary Pritzker, two members of a prominent and wealthy Chicago family, also gave a total of $2 million to the group just a few days before Clinton essentially tied Bernie Sanders in Iowa.

That's okay. I'm on the other side of that particular fence, but there's plenty of room for honest differences about her views and whether they're right for the country—differences that I don't think are fundamentally rooted in age.\n\nBut there's one issue where I suspect that age really does trip up millennials: the widespread belief that Hillary isn't trustworthy. It's easy to understand why they might think this. After all, Hillary has been surrounded by a miasma of scandal for decades—and even if you vaguely know that a lot of the allegations against her weren't fair, well, where there's smoke there's fire. So if you're familiar with the buzzwords—Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, the Rose law firm, Troopergate, Ken Starr, Benghazi, Emailgate—but not much else, it's only human to figure that maybe there really is something fishy in Hillary's past.\n\nBut many of us who lived through this stuff have exactly the opposite view. Not only do we know there's almost literally nothing to any of these \"scandals,\" we also know exactly how they were deliberately and cynically manufactured at every step along the way. We were there, watching it happen in real time. So not only do we believe Hillary is basically honest, but the buzzwords actively piss us off. Every time we hear a young progressive kinda sorta suggest that Hillary can't be trusted, we want to strangle someone. It's the ultimate proof of how the right wing's big lie about the Clintons has successfully poisoned not just the electorate in general, but even the progressive movement itself.\n\nI bring this up because I had to blink twice to make sure my eyes weren't fooling me this morning. Jill Abramson has followed Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than two decades, first in the Washington bureau of the Wall Street Journal, then at the New York Times, where she eventually became Washington bureau chief (and even later executive editor). Her perch gave her an unrivaled view into Hillary's actions. Here's what she had to say today in the Guardian:\n\nI would be \"dead rich\", to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every \"scandal\" that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I've launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I'm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nMany investigative articles about Clinton end up \"raising serious questions\" about \"potential\" conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\n…I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold…Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes.\n\nAs Abramson suggests, there are times when Hillary is her own worst enemy. The decades of attacks have made her insular and distrustful, and this often produces a lawyerly demeanor that makes her sound guilty even when she isn't. As a result, the belief in Hillary's slipperiness is now such conventional wisdom that it's almost impossible to dislodge. I just checked Memeorandum to see if anyone was discussing Abramson's piece, and I was unsurprised to find that it's gone almost entirely unnoticed.\n\nBut the truth is that regardless of how she sometimes sounds, her record is pretty clear: Hillary Clinton really is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. Don't let the conservative noise machine persuade you otherwise."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5534883720930232},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7348837209302326},"q1":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5534883720930232},"q2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5534883720930232},"q3":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5534883720930232},"q4":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q5":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q6":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.7348837209302326},"q7":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5534883720930232},"q8":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.4465116279069768},"q9":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.4465116279069768},"q10":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"female","confidence":0.5534883720930232},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":0.7348837209302326},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"republican","confidence":0.4465116279069768},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"donald_trump","confidence":0.4465116279069768}}}

Ted Cruz spent 18 minutes telling an emotional, gripping story of his familys history of drug and alcohol abuse. His older half-sister and later his father, he told an addiction policy forum, got hooked and became addicted. His sister died, his father survived only after becoming religious, Mr. Cruz said in a Baptist church here.\nSo it was jarring to hear Mr. Cruz then pivot to his policy solution: building a wall along the nations southern border to stop illegal immigration and halt the flow of drugs from Mexico.\nIf we want to turn around the drug crisis we have got to finally and permanently secure the border, Mr. Cruz said. We need to solve this problem, we need to build this wall.\nMr. Cruzs appearance at a drug addiction forum comes as New Hampshire voters have classified heroin as the states top problem. Rarely does a presidential candidate get through a town hall forum without being asked how theyd address the problem. Mr. Cruz said 48% of residents here know someone addicted to heroin  60% of people who are 35 years old or younger.\nTo connect with the audience, Mr. Cruz told of his older half-sister Miriam. The Texas senator, who wrote about her plight in his book last year, told of trying to rescue her from living in a Philadelphia crack house and subsidizing her sons boarding school before she died of a drug overdose in 2011.\nSometimes people make decisions, bound and determined, to destroy themselves, he said. You wonder as a family, Could I have done more? Was there a way to pull her back, to change the path she was on? Those are questions you can never fully answer.\nMr. Cruz then placed blame for the drug problem on the various groups he accused of abetting illegal immigration: Democrats (Theres a new politically correct term now for illegal immigrants: Its called undocumented Democrats, he said to awkward laughter) and business-oriented Republicans.\n\nWhats if anything even more cynical is all the Republicans who listen to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who listen to Wall Street, who listen to the lobbyists in Washington, Mr. Cruz said. They think its fabulous. Cheap labor drives down wages, what could be better? But its that political commitment that results in our not securing the border and not stopping the flow of drugs into this country.\nMr. Cruz has made combating illegal immigration a hallmark of his campaign. A onetime advocate of legalizing some undocumented immigrants, in 2015 he renounced that position when rival Donald Trump proposed deporting some 11 million people in the country illegally. Mr. Cruz has cited his opposition to the 2013 Senate immigration legislation that Sen. Marco Rubio co-authored as evidence of his bedrock conservative credentials.\nMr. Cruzs appeared here at what organizers billed as a non-political event to which all presidential campaigns were invited.\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who is a Hillary Clinton surrogate, spoke before Mr. Cruz arrived. Mr. Shumlin blamed the Food and Drug Administration for approving drugs like Oxycontin, a highly addictive painkiller that can lead to heroin abuse. Oxycontin was approved by the FDA in 1995, when Mrs. Clintons husband Bill Clinton was president.\nFollowing his remarks Mr. Cruz sat on a nine-person panel discussing ways to address New Hampshires drug crisis. He told the group, which included drug counselors and former addicts, that he supports legislation to funnel more federal money into drug prevention programs but reiterated that the problem is one that can only be solved at local levels.\nIts not going to be the government that solves this, Mr. Cruz said. Its going to take people on the ground connecting one person at a time. ¦ People have to make personal transformations.","gunning_fog_1":"8.4","flesch_1":"8.4","readability_1":"63.7","index_2":"16","title_2":"Message of Bernie Sanders’s New Ad: The Housing Crisis Isn’t Over","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/19/message-of-bernie-sanderss-new-ad-the-housing-crisis-isnt-over/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"The housing crisis has faded from the national conversation, but it is resurfacing as a potentially potent issue ahead of Saturday’s Democratic caucus in Nevada, where Bernie Sanders has released a new ad that speaks to its lingering devastation.\nThe ad, entitled “Our Home,” shows pictures of boarded up ranch-style homes and features homeowners speaking in English and Spanish about the experience of losing their homes.\nThe 60-second spot also highlights the interesting political moment, where a candidate running for the nomination of the incumbent party isn’t really running on the record of the party’s outgoing president. This is no “Morning in America.”\nThe housing crisis is nowhere near as acute as it was four or eight years ago, but Las Vegas is still ground zero. Around 22% of borrowers in the metro area owe more than their home is worth, the highest rate in the nation, according to Zillow. Of course, this is down from an astoundingly high 69% in 2012.\nThe drop reflects both the strong rebound in home prices over the last four years and the write-down of bad mortgage debt, primarily through foreclosure. Even in the hardest hit states such as Nevada and Florida, the share of mortgages that are delinquent or in foreclosure has also fallen sharply and are finally close to their pre-crisis levels.\n\n\nBut the ad illustrates how the memories of homes lost or marriages that fell apart aren’t fading even if the raw statistics show the acute crisis has passed. It doesn’t have to say what Mr. Sanders would do differently, now or then. Instead, it reinforces Mr. Sanders’s central campaign theme: the nation’s institutions, especially Wall Street, failed the country, and the government didn’t do nearly enough to respond for ordinary citizens.\nThe ad is heavy, but Mr. Sanders’s reading the “I approved this ad” disclaimed in Spanish is worth a grin. (Which New Yorker did it better?)\nOne observation the ad doesn’t make: Home prices have rebounded strongly in the U.S. and in Nevada over the past four years to a degree that few imagined was possible in 2012. Yale economist Robert Shiller said at the time he was worried “we might not see a major turnaround in our lifetimes.”\nMany of Mr. Obama’s strongest critics on the left argued that without a massive program of debt forgiveness, prices wouldn’t recover meaningfully because foreclosures wouldn’t end.\nInstead, low interest rates, an improving job market, and strong demand from investors soaked up the oversupply of homes, though pockets of distress remain. Now, many Western markets face a different housing crisis—a shortage of affordable homes, for sale or for rent.\nIn that sense, the ad effectively captures the frustrations many Americans still have with the economy. A few years ago, the idea that gas prices would fall below $1.75 a gallon, home prices would rise 20%, and the unemployment rate would drop below 5% would have seemed like implausible fantasy. All of those things happened, but Mr. Obama has received very little credit because the prosperity doesn’t seem to be broadly shared.","gunning_fog_2":"8.8","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"62.68","index_3":"88","title_3":"TOO MUCH SHARING AT STATE?

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"\nClinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. \nIn Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. \nThe secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. \n\"So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,\" said Sherman. \"To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.\"\nThe Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.\nPrevious email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. \nThe State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. \nThe conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,\" so it was born classified when the emails were created. \n\"Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,\" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. \"This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.\"\nA Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. \nThe polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important. \n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

Trump said he had no regrets about saying that the George W.

Bush’s tenure, Mr. Trump said.\n\nDuring the debate, discussing the war in Iraq, Mr. Trump said, “George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty.”\n\n“We should have never been in Iraq,” Mr. Trump said. “They lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none and they knew that there were none.” Jeb Bush defended his brother, as did Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a reflection of the former president’s durable popularity with Republicans in South Carolina, where primary voters will cast ballots on Saturday.\n\nThe remark was seen as potentially harmful to Mr. Trump with voters who still view Mr. Bush positively and who see “they lied” as similar to the type of attack that Democrats lobbed against Mr. Bush in 2004 and beyond. But Mr. Trump said on Sunday that he was unconcerned about any damage it could cause his candidacy here.\n\n“If it does, it does — I have to tell the truth,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m a big boy.”\n\nHe reiterated that the war was a “terrible, terrible mistake” that cost the nation dearly in American lives and money, a comment he has frequently made during the campaign.\n\nHowever, he softened his comment about Mr. Bush slightly, saying his remarks were “not against Bush, per se.

Ted Cruz as his private jet was approaching Nashua, N.H., earlier this month. “Ted is hanging around the top too long,” the Republican presidential front-runner announced on the plane, according to his campaign manager. “Time to take him down.” Mr. Trump’s airborne verdict to strike at his closest GOP rival and a look at other decisions like it reveal a truth behind his famously pointed attacks: Mr. Trump, not his staff or consultants, personally drives them, and they are both calculated and improvised to adapt to news and polls, with little research or extensive prep work.\n\n\nANDREW HARNIK/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nMr. Trump proceeded to question whether Mr. Cruz’s Canadian birth disqualified him. A week later, he tore into the Texas senator about a loan he took from Goldman Sachs to finance his political career and about his notoriety as a Senate “nasty guy.” The onslaught seemed to stall Mr. Cruz’s rise in Iowa, where polls show Mr. Trump holding an advantage. In a repeated pattern, Mr. Trump has fired personal attacks at rivals when they emerge as a challenge.

It echoes the argument she made in 2008, when she ran an ad saying a president must be ready for a “3 a.m. phone call” warning of imminent peril. It didn’t work then and some people close to the Clintons worry it won’t succeed now. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has narrowed Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Iowa ahead of the state’s Feb. 1 caucuses. He could scramble the race should he notch a victory there and in New Hampshire. His theme is direct: He is the champion of voters who are disillusioned with Washington politics and impatient with an economy that lavishes rewards on a tiny fraction of families. Peter Nicholas reports.\n \nVOTERS REACT TO POSSIBILITY OF BLOOMBERG RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY: Opposition, uncertainty and curiosity were among the reactions that voters in early primary states offered upon the news that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg might enter the presidential race as an independent. “I don’t know him very well,” said Juni Pierce, 73 years old, a retired gym teacher from Merrimack, N.H., who added that she believed the Republican-turned-Independent is now a Democrat. A gambit by Mr. Bloomberg, who wouldn’t face voters until the general election, would likely rest on his ability to attract centrists from both parties who admire his tight fiscal policies and liberal social attitudes. Among voters from across the political spectrum interviewed over the weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire, solid Republicans largely turned up their noses.

Blizzard\n\nWHAT WE’RE READING AROUND THE WEB\n\nThe Weekly Standard’s Michael Warren accompanied Sen. Ted Cruz  on a tour of New Hampshire and found an improved political performer: He’s gotten better at telling jokes, and is “becoming more skilled at answering questions that might deviate from his preferred script.”\n\nLittle-remembered Morry Taylor, a corporate executive who mounted his own quixotic, Donald Trump-like bid for president in 1996, tells Bloomberg’s Laurence Arnold that “he’d like to see a Trump-Carly Fiorina ticket, because CEOs ‘understand incompetency,’ which is what presidents must tackle throughout the federal bureaucracy.”\n\nThe Washington Examiner’s Byron York writes about his recent visit to New Hampshire, where he spoke with Republicans including former Gov.

At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."},"judgments_count":3,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.666666666666667,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:46+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-08T05:24:33+00:00","job_id":893813,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":1952996467,"created_at":"2016-04-08T04:51:56+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T04:50:09+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"UT","city":"Providence","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915129,"worker_id":34098234,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.96875,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"0","g2":"1","q1":"1","q2":"0","q3":"-1","q4":"1","q5":"-1","q6":"0","q7":"-1","q8":"0","q9":"-1","q10":"-1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"republican","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"23","index_1":"41","title_1":"Ted Cruz: To Help Stop Drug Abuse, Build the Mexico Border Wall","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/04/ted-cruz-to-help-stop-drug-abuse-build-the-mexico-border-wall/","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"HOOKSETT, N.H.  Ted Cruz spent 18 minutes telling an emotional, gripping story of his familys history of drug and alcohol abuse. His older half-sister and later his father, he told an addiction policy forum, got hooked and became addicted. His sister died, his father survived only after becoming religious, Mr. Cruz said in a Baptist church here.\nSo it was jarring to hear Mr. Cruz then pivot to his policy solution: building a wall along the nations southern border to stop illegal immigration and halt the flow of drugs from Mexico.\nIf we want to turn around the drug crisis we have got to finally and permanently secure the border, Mr. Cruz said. We need to solve this problem, we need to build this wall.\nMr. Cruzs appearance at a drug addiction forum comes as New Hampshire voters have classified heroin as the states top problem. Rarely does a presidential candidate get through a town hall forum without being asked how theyd address the problem. Mr. Cruz said 48% of residents here know someone addicted to heroin  60% of people who are 35 years old or younger.\nTo connect with the audience, Mr. Cruz told of his older half-sister Miriam. The Texas senator, who wrote about her plight in his book last year, told of trying to rescue her from living in a Philadelphia crack house and subsidizing her sons boarding school before she died of a drug overdose in 2011.\nSometimes people make decisions, bound and determined, to destroy themselves, he said. You wonder as a family, Could I have done more? Was there a way to pull her back, to change the path she was on? Those are questions you can never fully answer.\nMr. Cruz then placed blame for the drug problem on the various groups he accused of abetting illegal immigration: Democrats (Theres a new politically correct term now for illegal immigrants: Its called undocumented Democrats, he said to awkward laughter) and business-oriented Republicans.\n\nWhats if anything even more cynical is all the Republicans who listen to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who listen to Wall Street, who listen to the lobbyists in Washington, Mr. Cruz said. They think its fabulous. Cheap labor drives down wages, what could be better? But its that political commitment that results in our not securing the border and not stopping the flow of drugs into this country.\nMr. Cruz has made combating illegal immigration a hallmark of his campaign. A onetime advocate of legalizing some undocumented immigrants, in 2015 he renounced that position when rival Donald Trump proposed deporting some 11 million people in the country illegally. Mr. Cruz has cited his opposition to the 2013 Senate immigration legislation that Sen. Marco Rubio co-authored as evidence of his bedrock conservative credentials.\nMr. Cruzs appeared here at what organizers billed as a non-political event to which all presidential campaigns were invited.\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who is a Hillary Clinton surrogate, spoke before Mr. Cruz arrived. Mr. Shumlin blamed the Food and Drug Administration for approving drugs like Oxycontin, a highly addictive painkiller that can lead to heroin abuse. Oxycontin was approved by the FDA in 1995, when Mrs. Clintons husband Bill Clinton was president.\nFollowing his remarks Mr. Cruz sat on a nine-person panel discussing ways to address New Hampshires drug crisis. He told the group, which included drug counselors and former addicts, that he supports legislation to funnel more federal money into drug prevention programs but reiterated that the problem is one that can only be solved at local levels.\nIts not going to be the government that solves this, Mr. Cruz said. Its going to take people on the ground connecting one person at a time. ¦ People have to make personal transformations.","gunning_fog_1":"8.4","flesch_1":"8.4","readability_1":"63.7","index_2":"16","title_2":"Message of Bernie Sanders’s New Ad: The Housing Crisis Isn’t Over","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/19/message-of-bernie-sanderss-new-ad-the-housing-crisis-isnt-over/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"The housing crisis has faded from the national conversation, but it is resurfacing as a potentially potent issue ahead of Saturday’s Democratic caucus in Nevada, where Bernie Sanders has released a new ad that speaks to its lingering devastation.\nThe ad, entitled “Our Home,” shows pictures of boarded up ranch-style homes and features homeowners speaking in English and Spanish about the experience of losing their homes.\nThe 60-second spot also highlights the interesting political moment, where a candidate running for the nomination of the incumbent party isn’t really running on the record of the party’s outgoing president. This is no “Morning in America.”\nThe housing crisis is nowhere near as acute as it was four or eight years ago, but Las Vegas is still ground zero. Around 22% of borrowers in the metro area owe more than their home is worth, the highest rate in the nation, according to Zillow. Of course, this is down from an astoundingly high 69% in 2012.\nThe drop reflects both the strong rebound in home prices over the last four years and the write-down of bad mortgage debt, primarily through foreclosure. Even in the hardest hit states such as Nevada and Florida, the share of mortgages that are delinquent or in foreclosure has also fallen sharply and are finally close to their pre-crisis levels.\n\n\nBut the ad illustrates how the memories of homes lost or marriages that fell apart aren’t fading even if the raw statistics show the acute crisis has passed. It doesn’t have to say what Mr. Sanders would do differently, now or then. Instead, it reinforces Mr. Sanders’s central campaign theme: the nation’s institutions, especially Wall Street, failed the country, and the government didn’t do nearly enough to respond for ordinary citizens.\nThe ad is heavy, but Mr. Sanders’s reading the “I approved this ad” disclaimed in Spanish is worth a grin. (Which New Yorker did it better?)\nOne observation the ad doesn’t make: Home prices have rebounded strongly in the U.S. and in Nevada over the past four years to a degree that few imagined was possible in 2012. Yale economist Robert Shiller said at the time he was worried “we might not see a major turnaround in our lifetimes.”\nMany of Mr. Obama’s strongest critics on the left argued that without a massive program of debt forgiveness, prices wouldn’t recover meaningfully because foreclosures wouldn’t end.\nInstead, low interest rates, an improving job market, and strong demand from investors soaked up the oversupply of homes, though pockets of distress remain. Now, many Western markets face a different housing crisis—a shortage of affordable homes, for sale or for rent.\nIn that sense, the ad effectively captures the frustrations many Americans still have with the economy. A few years ago, the idea that gas prices would fall below $1.75 a gallon, home prices would rise 20%, and the unemployment rate would drop below 5% would have seemed like implausible fantasy. All of those things happened, but Mr. Obama has received very little credit because the prosperity doesn’t seem to be broadly shared.","gunning_fog_2":"8.8","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"62.68","index_3":"88","title_3":"TOO MUCH SHARING AT STATE?

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"\nClinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. \nIn Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. \nThe secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. \n\"So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,\" said Sherman. \"To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.\"\nThe Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.\nPrevious email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. \nThe State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. \nThe conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,\" so it was born classified when the emails were created. \n\"Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,\" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. \"This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.\"\nA Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. \nThe polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important. \n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

There were none and they knew that there were none.” Jeb Bush defended his brother, as did Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a reflection of the former president’s durable popularity with Republicans in South Carolina, where primary voters will cast ballots on Saturday.\n\nThe remark was seen as potentially harmful to Mr. Trump with voters who still view Mr. Bush positively and who see “they lied” as similar to the type of attack that Democrats lobbed against Mr. Bush in 2004 and beyond.

It echoes the argument she made in 2008, when she ran an ad saying a president must be ready for a “3 a.m. phone call” warning of imminent peril. It didn’t work then and some people close to the Clintons worry it won’t succeed now. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has narrowed Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Iowa ahead of the state’s Feb. 1 caucuses. He could scramble the race should he notch a victory there and in New Hampshire. His theme is direct: He is the champion of voters who are disillusioned with Washington politics and impatient with an economy that lavishes rewards on a tiny fraction of families. Peter Nicholas reports.\n \nVOTERS REACT TO POSSIBILITY OF BLOOMBERG RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY: Opposition, uncertainty and curiosity were among the reactions that voters in early primary states offered upon the news that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg might enter the presidential race as an independent. “I don’t know him very well,” said Juni Pierce, 73 years old, a retired gym teacher from Merrimack, N.H., who added that she believed the Republican-turned-Independent is now a Democrat. A gambit by Mr. Bloomberg, who wouldn’t face voters until the general election, would likely rest on his ability to attract centrists from both parties who admire his tight fiscal policies and liberal social attitudes. Among voters from across the political spectrum interviewed over the weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire, solid Republicans largely turned up their noses.

John Sununu who don’t understand the Trump phenomenon and say the polls may be wrong.

At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}},{"id":1953009659,"created_at":"2016-04-08T05:19:43+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T05:18:02+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"instagc","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"WV","city":"Martinsburg","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915129,"worker_id":33467170,"trust":0.6875,"worker_trust":0.857575757575758,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"-1","q1":"0","q2":"1","q3":"0","q4":"1","q5":"-1","q6":"1","q7":"1","q8":"1","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"male","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"bernie_sanders"},"unit_data":{"nil":"23","index_1":"41","title_1":"Ted Cruz: To Help Stop Drug Abuse, Build the Mexico Border Wall","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/04/ted-cruz-to-help-stop-drug-abuse-build-the-mexico-border-wall/","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"HOOKSETT, N.H.  Ted Cruz spent 18 minutes telling an emotional, gripping story of his familys history of drug and alcohol abuse. His older half-sister and later his father, he told an addiction policy forum, got hooked and became addicted. His sister died, his father survived only after becoming religious, Mr. Cruz said in a Baptist church here.\nSo it was jarring to hear Mr. Cruz then pivot to his policy solution: building a wall along the nations southern border to stop illegal immigration and halt the flow of drugs from Mexico.\nIf we want to turn around the drug crisis we have got to finally and permanently secure the border, Mr. Cruz said. We need to solve this problem, we need to build this wall.\nMr. Cruzs appearance at a drug addiction forum comes as New Hampshire voters have classified heroin as the states top problem. Rarely does a presidential candidate get through a town hall forum without being asked how theyd address the problem. Mr. Cruz said 48% of residents here know someone addicted to heroin  60% of people who are 35 years old or younger.\nTo connect with the audience, Mr. Cruz told of his older half-sister Miriam. The Texas senator, who wrote about her plight in his book last year, told of trying to rescue her from living in a Philadelphia crack house and subsidizing her sons boarding school before she died of a drug overdose in 2011.\nSometimes people make decisions, bound and determined, to destroy themselves, he said. You wonder as a family, Could I have done more? Was there a way to pull her back, to change the path she was on? Those are questions you can never fully answer.\nMr. Cruz then placed blame for the drug problem on the various groups he accused of abetting illegal immigration: Democrats (Theres a new politically correct term now for illegal immigrants: Its called undocumented Democrats, he said to awkward laughter) and business-oriented Republicans.\n\nWhats if anything even more cynical is all the Republicans who listen to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who listen to Wall Street, who listen to the lobbyists in Washington, Mr. Cruz said. They think its fabulous. Cheap labor drives down wages, what could be better? But its that political commitment that results in our not securing the border and not stopping the flow of drugs into this country.\nMr. Cruz has made combating illegal immigration a hallmark of his campaign. A onetime advocate of legalizing some undocumented immigrants, in 2015 he renounced that position when rival Donald Trump proposed deporting some 11 million people in the country illegally. Mr. Cruz has cited his opposition to the 2013 Senate immigration legislation that Sen. Marco Rubio co-authored as evidence of his bedrock conservative credentials.\nMr. Cruzs appeared here at what organizers billed as a non-political event to which all presidential campaigns were invited.\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who is a Hillary Clinton surrogate, spoke before Mr. Cruz arrived. Mr. Shumlin blamed the Food and Drug Administration for approving drugs like Oxycontin, a highly addictive painkiller that can lead to heroin abuse. Oxycontin was approved by the FDA in 1995, when Mrs. Clintons husband Bill Clinton was president.\nFollowing his remarks Mr. Cruz sat on a nine-person panel discussing ways to address New Hampshires drug crisis. He told the group, which included drug counselors and former addicts, that he supports legislation to funnel more federal money into drug prevention programs but reiterated that the problem is one that can only be solved at local levels.\nIts not going to be the government that solves this, Mr. Cruz said. Its going to take people on the ground connecting one person at a time. ¦ People have to make personal transformations.","gunning_fog_1":"8.4","flesch_1":"8.4","readability_1":"63.7","index_2":"16","title_2":"Message of Bernie Sanders’s New Ad: The Housing Crisis Isn’t Over","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/19/message-of-bernie-sanderss-new-ad-the-housing-crisis-isnt-over/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"The housing crisis has faded from the national conversation, but it is resurfacing as a potentially potent issue ahead of Saturday’s Democratic caucus in Nevada, where Bernie Sanders has released a new ad that speaks to its lingering devastation.\nThe ad, entitled “Our Home,” shows pictures of boarded up ranch-style homes and features homeowners speaking in English and Spanish about the experience of losing their homes.\nThe 60-second spot also highlights the interesting political moment, where a candidate running for the nomination of the incumbent party isn’t really running on the record of the party’s outgoing president. This is no “Morning in America.”\nThe housing crisis is nowhere near as acute as it was four or eight years ago, but Las Vegas is still ground zero. Around 22% of borrowers in the metro area owe more than their home is worth, the highest rate in the nation, according to Zillow. Of course, this is down from an astoundingly high 69% in 2012.\nThe drop reflects both the strong rebound in home prices over the last four years and the write-down of bad mortgage debt, primarily through foreclosure. Even in the hardest hit states such as Nevada and Florida, the share of mortgages that are delinquent or in foreclosure has also fallen sharply and are finally close to their pre-crisis levels.\n\n\nBut the ad illustrates how the memories of homes lost or marriages that fell apart aren’t fading even if the raw statistics show the acute crisis has passed. It doesn’t have to say what Mr. Sanders would do differently, now or then. Instead, it reinforces Mr. Sanders’s central campaign theme: the nation’s institutions, especially Wall Street, failed the country, and the government didn’t do nearly enough to respond for ordinary citizens.\nThe ad is heavy, but Mr. Sanders’s reading the “I approved this ad” disclaimed in Spanish is worth a grin. (Which New Yorker did it better?)\nOne observation the ad doesn’t make: Home prices have rebounded strongly in the U.S. and in Nevada over the past four years to a degree that few imagined was possible in 2012. Yale economist Robert Shiller said at the time he was worried “we might not see a major turnaround in our lifetimes.”\nMany of Mr. Obama’s strongest critics on the left argued that without a massive program of debt forgiveness, prices wouldn’t recover meaningfully because foreclosures wouldn’t end.\nInstead, low interest rates, an improving job market, and strong demand from investors soaked up the oversupply of homes, though pockets of distress remain. Now, many Western markets face a different housing crisis—a shortage of affordable homes, for sale or for rent.\nIn that sense, the ad effectively captures the frustrations many Americans still have with the economy. A few years ago, the idea that gas prices would fall below $1.75 a gallon, home prices would rise 20%, and the unemployment rate would drop below 5% would have seemed like implausible fantasy. All of those things happened, but Mr. Obama has received very little credit because the prosperity doesn’t seem to be broadly shared.","gunning_fog_2":"8.8","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"62.68","index_3":"88","title_3":"TOO MUCH SHARING AT STATE?

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"\nClinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. \nIn Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. \nThe secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. \n\"So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,\" said Sherman. \"To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.\"\nThe Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.\nPrevious email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. \nThe State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. \nThe conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,\" so it was born classified when the emails were created. \n\"Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,\" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. \"This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.\"\nA Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. \nThe polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important. \n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty.”\n\n“We should have never been in Iraq,” Mr. Trump said. “They lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none and they knew that there were none.” Jeb Bush defended his brother, as did Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a reflection of the former president’s durable popularity with Republicans in South Carolina, where primary voters will cast ballots on Saturday.\n\nThe remark was seen as potentially harmful to Mr. Trump with voters who still view Mr. Bush positively and who see “they lied” as similar to the type of attack that Democrats lobbed against Mr. Bush in 2004 and beyond.

It echoes the argument she made in 2008, when she ran an ad saying a president must be ready for a “3 a.m. phone call” warning of imminent peril. It didn’t work then and some people close to the Clintons worry it won’t succeed now. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has narrowed Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Iowa ahead of the state’s Feb. 1 caucuses.

Peter Nicholas reports.\n \nVOTERS REACT TO POSSIBILITY OF BLOOMBERG RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY: Opposition, uncertainty and curiosity were among the reactions that voters in early primary states offered upon the news that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg might enter the presidential race as an independent. “I don’t know him very well,” said Juni Pierce, 73 years old, a retired gym teacher from Merrimack, N.H., who added that she believed the Republican-turned-Independent is now a Democrat. A gambit by Mr. Bloomberg, who wouldn’t face voters until the general election, would likely rest on his ability to attract centrists from both parties who admire his tight fiscal policies and liberal social attitudes. Among voters from across the political spectrum interviewed over the weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire, solid Republicans largely turned up their noses.

At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}},{"id":1953011282,"created_at":"2016-04-08T05:24:21+00:00","started_at":"2016-04-08T05:14:47+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"TX","city":"Dallas","job_id":893813,"unit_id":928915129,"worker_id":36761089,"trust":0.625,"worker_trust":0.9625,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"g1":"1","g2":"2","q1":"0","q2":"2","q3":"1","q4":"1","q5":"-1","q6":"1","q7":"0","q8":"1","q9":"-1","q10":"1","what_is_your_gender":"female","what_is_your_age":"1829","what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":"democrat","if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":"might_not_vote"},"unit_data":{"nil":"23","index_1":"41","title_1":"Ted Cruz: To Help Stop Drug Abuse, Build the Mexico Border Wall","url_1":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/04/ted-cruz-to-help-stop-drug-abuse-build-the-mexico-border-wall/","candidate_1":"Ted Cruz","org_1":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_1":"Immigration","body_1":"HOOKSETT, N.H.  Ted Cruz spent 18 minutes telling an emotional, gripping story of his familys history of drug and alcohol abuse. His older half-sister and later his father, he told an addiction policy forum, got hooked and became addicted. His sister died, his father survived only after becoming religious, Mr. Cruz said in a Baptist church here.\nSo it was jarring to hear Mr. Cruz then pivot to his policy solution: building a wall along the nations southern border to stop illegal immigration and halt the flow of drugs from Mexico.\nIf we want to turn around the drug crisis we have got to finally and permanently secure the border, Mr. Cruz said. We need to solve this problem, we need to build this wall.\nMr. Cruzs appearance at a drug addiction forum comes as New Hampshire voters have classified heroin as the states top problem. Rarely does a presidential candidate get through a town hall forum without being asked how theyd address the problem. Mr. Cruz said 48% of residents here know someone addicted to heroin  60% of people who are 35 years old or younger.\nTo connect with the audience, Mr. Cruz told of his older half-sister Miriam. The Texas senator, who wrote about her plight in his book last year, told of trying to rescue her from living in a Philadelphia crack house and subsidizing her sons boarding school before she died of a drug overdose in 2011.\nSometimes people make decisions, bound and determined, to destroy themselves, he said. You wonder as a family, Could I have done more? Was there a way to pull her back, to change the path she was on? Those are questions you can never fully answer.\nMr. Cruz then placed blame for the drug problem on the various groups he accused of abetting illegal immigration: Democrats (Theres a new politically correct term now for illegal immigrants: Its called undocumented Democrats, he said to awkward laughter) and business-oriented Republicans.\n\nWhats if anything even more cynical is all the Republicans who listen to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who listen to Wall Street, who listen to the lobbyists in Washington, Mr. Cruz said. They think its fabulous. Cheap labor drives down wages, what could be better? But its that political commitment that results in our not securing the border and not stopping the flow of drugs into this country.\nMr. Cruz has made combating illegal immigration a hallmark of his campaign. A onetime advocate of legalizing some undocumented immigrants, in 2015 he renounced that position when rival Donald Trump proposed deporting some 11 million people in the country illegally. Mr. Cruz has cited his opposition to the 2013 Senate immigration legislation that Sen. Marco Rubio co-authored as evidence of his bedrock conservative credentials.\nMr. Cruzs appeared here at what organizers billed as a non-political event to which all presidential campaigns were invited.\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who is a Hillary Clinton surrogate, spoke before Mr. Cruz arrived. Mr. Shumlin blamed the Food and Drug Administration for approving drugs like Oxycontin, a highly addictive painkiller that can lead to heroin abuse. Oxycontin was approved by the FDA in 1995, when Mrs. Clintons husband Bill Clinton was president.\nFollowing his remarks Mr. Cruz sat on a nine-person panel discussing ways to address New Hampshires drug crisis. He told the group, which included drug counselors and former addicts, that he supports legislation to funnel more federal money into drug prevention programs but reiterated that the problem is one that can only be solved at local levels.\nIts not going to be the government that solves this, Mr. Cruz said. Its going to take people on the ground connecting one person at a time. ¦ People have to make personal transformations.","gunning_fog_1":"8.4","flesch_1":"8.4","readability_1":"63.7","index_2":"16","title_2":"Message of Bernie Sanders’s New Ad: The Housing Crisis Isn’t Over","url_2":"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/19/message-of-bernie-sanderss-new-ad-the-housing-crisis-isnt-over/","candidate_2":"Bernie Sanders","org_2":"The Wall Street Journal","top_topic_2":"Immigration","body_2":"The housing crisis has faded from the national conversation, but it is resurfacing as a potentially potent issue ahead of Saturday’s Democratic caucus in Nevada, where Bernie Sanders has released a new ad that speaks to its lingering devastation.\nThe ad, entitled “Our Home,” shows pictures of boarded up ranch-style homes and features homeowners speaking in English and Spanish about the experience of losing their homes.\nThe 60-second spot also highlights the interesting political moment, where a candidate running for the nomination of the incumbent party isn’t really running on the record of the party’s outgoing president. This is no “Morning in America.”\nThe housing crisis is nowhere near as acute as it was four or eight years ago, but Las Vegas is still ground zero. Around 22% of borrowers in the metro area owe more than their home is worth, the highest rate in the nation, according to Zillow. Of course, this is down from an astoundingly high 69% in 2012.\nThe drop reflects both the strong rebound in home prices over the last four years and the write-down of bad mortgage debt, primarily through foreclosure. Even in the hardest hit states such as Nevada and Florida, the share of mortgages that are delinquent or in foreclosure has also fallen sharply and are finally close to their pre-crisis levels.\n\n\nBut the ad illustrates how the memories of homes lost or marriages that fell apart aren’t fading even if the raw statistics show the acute crisis has passed. It doesn’t have to say what Mr. Sanders would do differently, now or then. Instead, it reinforces Mr. Sanders’s central campaign theme: the nation’s institutions, especially Wall Street, failed the country, and the government didn’t do nearly enough to respond for ordinary citizens.\nThe ad is heavy, but Mr. Sanders’s reading the “I approved this ad” disclaimed in Spanish is worth a grin. (Which New Yorker did it better?)\nOne observation the ad doesn’t make: Home prices have rebounded strongly in the U.S. and in Nevada over the past four years to a degree that few imagined was possible in 2012. Yale economist Robert Shiller said at the time he was worried “we might not see a major turnaround in our lifetimes.”\nMany of Mr. Obama’s strongest critics on the left argued that without a massive program of debt forgiveness, prices wouldn’t recover meaningfully because foreclosures wouldn’t end.\nInstead, low interest rates, an improving job market, and strong demand from investors soaked up the oversupply of homes, though pockets of distress remain. Now, many Western markets face a different housing crisis—a shortage of affordable homes, for sale or for rent.\nIn that sense, the ad effectively captures the frustrations many Americans still have with the economy. A few years ago, the idea that gas prices would fall below $1.75 a gallon, home prices would rise 20%, and the unemployment rate would drop below 5% would have seemed like implausible fantasy. All of those things happened, but Mr. Obama has received very little credit because the prosperity doesn’t seem to be broadly shared.","gunning_fog_2":"8.8","flesch_2":"8.7","readability_2":"62.68","index_3":"88","title_3":"TOO MUCH SHARING AT STATE?

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"\nClinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. \nIn Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. \nThe secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. \n\"So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,\" said Sherman. \"To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.\"\nThe Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.\nPrevious email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. \nThe State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. \nThe conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,\" so it was born classified when the emails were created. \n\"Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,\" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. \"This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.\"\nA Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. \nThe polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important. \n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty.”\n\n“We should have never been in Iraq,” Mr. Trump said. “They lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none and they knew that there were none.” Jeb Bush defended his brother, as did Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a reflection of the former president’s durable popularity with Republicans in South Carolina, where primary voters will cast ballots on Saturday.\n\nThe remark was seen as potentially harmful to Mr. Trump with voters who still view Mr. Bush positively and who see “they lied” as similar to the type of attack that Democrats lobbed against Mr. Bush in 2004 and beyond.

It echoes the argument she made in 2008, when she ran an ad saying a president must be ready for a “3 a.m. phone call” warning of imminent peril. It didn’t work then and some people close to the Clintons worry it won’t succeed now. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has narrowed Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Iowa ahead of the state’s Feb. 1 caucuses. He could scramble the race should he notch a victory there and in New Hampshire. His theme is direct: He is the champion of voters who are disillusioned with Washington politics and impatient with an economy that lavishes rewards on a tiny fraction of families. Peter Nicholas reports.\n \nVOTERS REACT TO POSSIBILITY OF BLOOMBERG RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY: Opposition, uncertainty and curiosity were among the reactions that voters in early primary states offered upon the news that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg might enter the presidential race as an independent. “I don’t know him very well,” said Juni Pierce, 73 years old, a retired gym teacher from Merrimack, N.H., who added that she believed the Republican-turned-Independent is now a Democrat. A gambit by Mr. Bloomberg, who wouldn’t face voters until the general election, would likely rest on his ability to attract centrists from both parties who admire his tight fiscal policies and liberal social attitudes. Among voters from across the political spectrum interviewed over the weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire, solid Republicans largely turned up their noses. Heather Haddon and Jennifer Levitz report.\n\nPlus: Michael Bloomberg’s possible foray into the race drew support from an unlikely corner: Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner whose candidacy is said to have inspired a potential bid from the former New York mayor.\n\nTHE OUTLOOK: Every U.S. recession since World War II has been foretold by sharp declines in industrial production, corporate profits and the stock market.

Ted Cruz  on a tour of New Hampshire and found an improved political performer: He’s gotten better at telling jokes, and is “becoming more skilled at answering questions that might deviate from his preferred script.”\n\nLittle-remembered Morry Taylor, a corporate executive who mounted his own quixotic, Donald Trump-like bid for president in 1996, tells Bloomberg’s Laurence Arnold that “he’d like to see a Trump-Carly Fiorina ticket, because CEOs ‘understand incompetency,’ which is what presidents must tackle throughout the federal bureaucracy.”\n\nThe Washington Examiner’s Byron York writes about his recent visit to New Hampshire, where he spoke with Republicans including former Gov. John Sununu who don’t understand the Trump phenomenon and say the polls may be wrong. He concludes that they may not understand it because “if it is real, it would say something about their state that they don’t quite understand.”\n\nAlthough the New Hampshire tradition of trial by town meeting seems diminished in the 2016 presidential primary race, the primary’s “old ways and old role” are far from dead because the roots just run too deep, writes David M.

At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen,” she said. “I’m not even going to answer that question.”\n\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\n\nFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely. It’s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\n\nI would be “dead rich”, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\n\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I’ve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. I’m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\n\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\n\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\n\n\nWhich issue do you want US election candidates to discuss?\n Read more\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\n\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\n\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. “We expect purity from women candidates,” he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, “it’s seen as dishonest”, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton: “Have you always told the truth?” She gave an honest response, “I’ve always tried to, always. Always.” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room”. What politician wouldn’t?\n\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life. The distrust continues.\n\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn’t have rhino hide, and during her husband’s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\n\nLike most politicians, she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\n\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\n\nIt’s fair to expect more transparency. But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity."}}],"g1":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5675675675675675},"g2":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.43243243243243246},"q1":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.5675675675675675},"q2":{"agg":"0","confidence":0.43243243243243246},"q3":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.43243243243243246},"q4":{"agg":"1","confidence":1.0},"q5":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q6":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5675675675675675},"q7":{"agg":"-1","confidence":0.43243243243243246},"q8":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5675675675675675},"q9":{"agg":"-1","confidence":1.0},"q10":{"agg":"1","confidence":0.5675675675675675},"what_is_your_gender":{"agg":"male","confidence":0.7297297297297297},"what_is_your_age":{"agg":"1829","confidence":1.0},"what_is_your_political_party_affiliation":{"agg":"democrat","confidence":0.5675675675675675},"if_the_election_were_tomorrow_i_would_vote_for":{"agg":"bernie_sanders","confidence":0.7297297297297297}}}
