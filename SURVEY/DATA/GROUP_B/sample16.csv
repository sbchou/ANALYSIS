28,28,1563,Sanders campaign touts another endorsement that didn't happen,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/11/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-dreamer-support/index.html,sanders,cnn,Immigration,11.5,10.4,"(XXX) Once again, the Bernie Sanders' campaign finds itself having claimed the support of someone who didn't exactly endorse the Vermont senator.
Brenda Romero, a Nevada student leader and DREAMer that Bernie Sanders' campaign touted as someone who endorsed their campaign, tells XXX she never endorsed the Vermont senator and is backing Hillary Clinton.
Romero said Monday she had agreed to be part of Sanders' Nevada Latino Steering Committee, but that she never endorsed the senator.
Sanders released the list of activists and elected officials on his Latino committee in January. 
""Tomorrow, a group of highly respected community leaders will announce their support for Bernie Sanders for president,"" said a statement about the press conference. 
The list included Lucy Flores, former Nevada state assemblywoman and congressional candidate, and Romero, a undocumented DREAMer and class president at College of Southern Nevada.
""I didn't agree to such an endorsement,"" Romero said Monday, noting that while she agreed to be part of the steering committee, she was told that the role would be advising the ""campaign and potentially Sen. Sanders about immigration issues.""
Romero is the latest in a string of endorsements touted by Sanders who didn't actually back the Vermont senator. 
Two newspapers in New Hampshire that had not backed the senator were included in an ad titled ""Endorsed"" and last month in Iowa, an ad by the Sanders campaign included the Des Moines Register in a list of newspapers that have backed the senator. 
The Register actually endorsed Clinton. 
What's more, the AARP and the League of Conservation Voters have said the Sanders campaign has used their logos in mailers without their permission.
In an emails provided by the Sanders campaign, Romero did agree to be part of the steering committee, telling a Sanders staffer that she would be ""honored to be part of this.""
The email asking for Romero's support came from Erika Andiola, Sanders' Latino outreach strategist. In the email, Aniola told Romero she would ""be serving the campaign in an advisory capacity and offering feedback on how we can best connect with and mobilize support in the Latino community for the remaining life of the campaign.""
Nowhere in the email exchange, though, does Romero agree to endorse Sanders. In fact, Romero asked not to have her title included in any campaign lists because as student body president, she has ""to stay neutral to candidates.""
But because Romero has grown frustrated with the Sanders campaign, she said Monday that she is backing Clinton.
""I believe that Hillary has my back, and that she is the only candidate capable of accomplishing things in the face of Republican obstruction,"" Clinton said. ""She will get things done for immigrants families.""
Aside from providing the emails with Romero, the Sanders campaign did not comment for this story.
Clinton, too, has dealt with touting endorsements that haven't actually happened. Two mayors -- one from Wilmington, Delaware, and another from San Antonio -- were among a list of 50 mayors that endorsed Clinton in October. But shortly after the list was released to the public, both mayors said they had yet to officially endorse the former secretary of state.
Sanders, who is currently leading in New Hampshire, is fighting to pick up ground on Clinton in Nevada, a state that most observers feel is more demographically suitable for her. While there has been a dearth of polling in the state, Clinton held a sizable lead, according to polls released late last year.
Clinton has picked up a number of top endorsements in the Silver State, including one earlier this month from Astrid Silva, possibly the nation's more recognizable DREAMer, an undocumented immigrant brought into the country as a child.
Sanders' campaign dismissed the Silva endorsement when the senator's press secretary for Latino outreach tweeted that Silva was a ""press hit"" for Clinton.
Romero said Monday that the response to Silva factored into her decision to back Clinton.
""I'm also disappointed by the attacks from senior staffers on the Sanders campaign on Astrid Silva,"" she said. ""It shows how disconnected they are from Nevada, and they should apologize to her. There is no room for hate between DREAMers in this campaign.""",10.4,11.5,50.16,0.0,CNN
30,30,1815,"First Draft: Ted Cruz, on New Hampshire Bus Tour, Makes a Brief Effort in Spanish",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/19/ted-cruz-on-new-hampshire-bus-tour-makes-a-brief-stop-in-spanish/,cruz,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,4.0,6.4,"PLYMOUTH, N.H. — At virtually every campaign stop, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas tells the tale of his father’s exodus from Cuba. He is less likely to speak the country’s official language.

But inside a pub teeming with supporters here, including a small group of Spanish speakers, Mr. Cruz could not resist a stab at the language that competitors like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeb Bush speak much more readily. (Mr. Cruz has appraised his own Spanish as “lousy.”) 

 “Qué bueno!” he said, turning to the group’s members as he took questions from the crowd. “De dónde?”

 They said they, too, had Cuban roots.

 “O.K., you guys are in trouble,” he said, to laughs. “There’re too many Cubans in the room.”

 Mr. Cruz was two days into a five-day bus tour through the state, amid an increasingly heated contest with Donald J. Trump. Among other issues, the two have tussled over Mr. Cruz’s slight that Mr. Trump embodied “New York values.”

 On this point, one of the Spanish speakers seemed to have Mr. Cruz’s back.

 “I’m a conservative from New York City,” she said.

 “Fantastic!” Mr. Cruz said. ",6.4,4.0,85.69,0.0,The New York Times
46,46,2014,Ted Cruz worry: Big South Carolina loss equals bad Super Tuesday,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/19/politics/ted-cruz-south-carolina-super-tuesday/index.html,cruz,cnn,Abortion,9.1,10.4,"(XXX) What if the firewall crumbles?
That's the worry of a growing number of people close to Ted Cruz's campaign, who are privately beginning to fear that a big loss in South Carolina to Donald Trump on Saturday could signal more defeats to come in the so-called SEC states that are the lynchpin of Cruz's strategy. 
""If they're pretty far back from Trump and they can't get southern conservative evangelicals in South Carolina, I do think they're probably going to have a hard time elsewhere,"" said Erick Erickson, a conservative writer in touch with Cruz's team. ""I sense a real fear from people that if Trump blows everybody out of the water in South Carolina, that he is suddenly unstoppable."" 
Cruz's team once envisioned South Carolina as a rubber match between Trump, the New Hampshire victor, and Cruz, the Iowa winner. Now, it's being read as an omen of what's to come in 10 days' time when Southern states vote on Super Tuesday.
Cruz once called the God-fearing, gun-toting SEC states that vote then on March 1 his ""firewall,"" but polls show Trump leading in South Carolina, and a dominant performance Saturday would show that Cruz has not been able to sufficiently consolidate the evangelical base that he needs to win down the road in places like Tennessee and Georgia.
The recent XXX Poll of Polls shows Trump with an average lead of 16 percentage points over Cruz, though a new NBC News/XXX/Marist survey on Friday showed Cruz only 5 points back.
Several people close to the campaign concede that losing South Carolina by double digits would spell serious trouble for Super Tuesday. If it's a tighter loss, some say, it would validate the theory that Trump was susceptible to their attacks and encourage more.
""Everybody is watching: Can support be stripped from Donald Trump?"" one pro-Cruz fundraiser asked, predicting that if Trump only earns between 25% and 30%, it will ""unleash"" a new wave of anti-Trump money. ""Then people will realize Trump can be beaten in a lot of the March 1 states."" 
""But if Trump gets 38 or 40 -- and Cruz is second with 22 or something like that -- it's going to be very ominous,"" the fundraiser added.
All week, Cruz has campaigned with the same urgency seen in the lead-up to Iowa, gleefully drawing sharp contrasts with Trump and Rubio alike. He has rolled out his best endorsements, including one from Rep. Mark Sanford on Friday. And he has showed an awareness of the high stakes on Saturday for his campaign, where the narrative could begin to swing against him in the South.
""Twenty-one hours. That's how long we've got until the polls close,"" Cruz said in Myrtle Beach. ""These next 21 hours are going to decide a great deal.""

Cruz allies are doing everything they can to separate their candidate's fortunes in South Carolina from those elsewhere in the South. 
The campaign points to a national XXX survey this week that showed Cruz leading Trump by 2 points, although other national polls still have the New York businessman easily in the lead. They also maintain that Trump's position on abortion and his recent comments about the presidency of George W. Bush will doom him in the South. 
""It's a little tough to do an exact extrapolation between what happened in South Carolina and on March 1,"" said Jason Miller, a senior Cruz adviser, who stressed that Cruz has already proven in Iowa that it can turn out his voters. ""These are states that Ted Cruz matches up well in."" 
Cruz surrogate Jack Kingston, a former congressman from just over the border in Georgia, went so far as to tell reporters Thursday that Cruz ""shouldn't even be viable"" in South Carolina, quite the departure from a state that Cruz's team once saw as winnable. 
Glenn Beck: God took Scalia to give America Ted Cruz as president
It is hard to overstate the importance of March 1 to Cruz's self-professed path to victory -- he has made the date, which will award more delegates than any other day in the Republican calendar, the cornerstone of his strategy. 
Allies tell XXX Cruz is hoping to win 60% of the delegates there. He scrapped time in Iowa to take two barnstorming bus tours of the south. He's called his operation three to five times better than the rest of the field's. And the core of Cruz's SEC stronghold, his home state of Texas, is still unlikely to be pierced.

The Cruz campaign appears as occupied with Marco Rubio leapfrogging them into third place as it is with catching Trump for first. It releases anti-Rubio attack ads at a daily rate and has jumped squarely into a messy, seemingly endless argument with Rubio's over Facebook pages and Photoshopped images.
Miller and Cruz aides are trying to hoist Rubio's expectations as high as possible: Given Rubio's endorsements here, including Gov. Nikki Haley, Cruz's team argues Rubio needs to outright win the state in order to meet them.
As for Trump, the plan is simple: attack.
With the race shifting to a national campaign defined more by expensive television ads than retail politics, some Cruz supporters have faith that South Carolina will show that negative ads like those Cruz forces have aired against Trump will work. After largely skating free in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump is finally being attacked by a battery of super PACs. 
Cruz's campaign is hitting Trump on those issues, airing ads featuring Trump's 1999 interview with the late Tim Russert in which he declares he is ""pro-choice."" (Trump maintains his position has changed and sent Cruz a cease-and-desist letter, which Cruz laughed off.) 
Ted Cruz to Donald Trump: Sue me
Assuming Cruz does hold off Rubio, though, the key will be how large the margin of loss is to Trump, who also holds a large lead in Nevada. 
""If Trump wins and we're second, the SEC primary becomes a 50/50 scenario,"" said one Cruz insider. ""It's our territory, but he'll have the momentum."" 
In the meantime, Cruz is trying his best to look ahead. When a foreign-born woman who now lives in Georgia crossed the Carolina border to see Cruz in Greenville on Thursday, Cruz was as eager to get her to the ballot box as she was herself. 
""The reason I became an American citizen is so I can vote for people like you,"" Hannah Kanner, born in communist Czechoslovakia, told him. ""I'm from Georgia -- sorry! I wish I could vote on Saturday, but I can't."" 
""On March 1,"" Cruz replied, ""you can.""",10.4,9.1,67.08,0.0,CNN
54,54,1994,Ted Cruz's conventional campaign to win Iowa,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/02/politics/ted-cruz-iowa-caucuses-2016/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.1,11.2,"Jefferson, Iowa (XXX) In the waning days before the Iowa caucuses, Ted Cruz, almost always the unflappable performer, began to grow wistful.
""The wild rollercoaster ride we've had for the last year is going to be over,"" the Texas senator told one crowd. 
""It has been a bit of a circus,"" he added.
Faced with the Donald Trump Circus, Cruz went with an old-school Iowa strategy: Visit early. Invest in retail. Organize pastors. Tend to homeschoolers. Win the two big nods. Get outside of Des Moines.
Despite Trump's unconventional campaign, and attacks from the billionaire that included questioning Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his being born in Canada, unaligned operatives until the last moments here remained certain that the core of Iowa caucus politics had not changed, despite Trump's unconventional campaign. 
""Iowa has sent notice,"" Cruz said Monday night, ""that the Republican nominee of the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment, will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force, where all sovereignty resides in our nation, by we the people, the American people.""
Cruz's team, basking in victory, projected more confidence than ever before that a strong showing in New Hampshire was within reach. Spokesman Rick Tyler pointed to Cruz's cash on hand, lapping the field by a considerable margin, and said it would put Cruz in a far better position than Marco Rubio and others in the Granite State -- even as they conceded Rubio now entered with momentum.

It was a victory set into motion two and a half years ago, when Cruz first touched down at the Des Moines Marriott -- only six months after he had been sworn into the Senate. 
Cruz was known at the time for ideological purity -- not evangelical fervor -- but over the next few years, he would add to his Christian image, citing Scripture repeatedly in barns and convenience stores as he became more and more tailor-made for Iowa Republicans.
On that first trip here in August 2013, he met with a network of influential Iowa pastors, the same group he returned to last Monday, just a week before clergymen like them would help decide his fate. And he built his own network of evangelical pastors, recruiting one chief in each county and integrating them into a state leadership team that dwarfed other candidates' in size. 
For much of 2015, Cruz visited Iowa consistently, but not overwhelmingly. He thumbed his nose at GOP rivals who essentially moved to the state in search of lightning strike. But he invested in face time, lingering late on a baseball diamond the day of the gay marriage decision in June and at a high-profile evangelical forum in November on one particularly long Iowa day.
And he deliberately and conscientiously identified, courted and landed the two major conservative endorsements behind past Iowa winners, Rep. Steve King and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats, who together have been a road show for Cruz during his visits here over the past two months. 
Their endorsements coincided with Cruz's first major surge in Iowa surveys, culminating with Cruz taking the lead in a Des Moines Register poll in mid-December. With King, he had a provocative spokesperson and a validator in the intense boxing match with the ethanol lobby. With Vander Plaats, he had a networker who could stick around to win over the weary (""It's not that we dislike Santorum,"" he told one voter on the way out the door Saturday.)

Cruz, who had worked hard to tamper expectations, had inadvertently raised them.
""You see the poll?"" Jeff King, the congressman's son, who leads the Cruz super PAC operation here in Iowa, remembers saying to another group official then. ""We're going to have to do well in Iowa.""
Cruz's wager on Iowa stood in contrast to his closest rivals: Trump and Rubio, both of whom are expected to do better in New Hampshire than the Texas senator.
""When he started this thing, he was nowhere,"" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz, standing on a chair as an overflow Cruz crowd surrounded him in Ames. ""I would use this campaign to teach others how to run a race."" 
Monday morning, the Texan's campaign bus ambled to a basketball court in this Greene County town along the Raccoon River to pay heed to Iowa's most revered custom: the ""Full Grassley,"" or the pledge to visit all 99 counties, named for Sen. Chuck Grassley.
""Whatever campaign techniques were used by the campaign that has won, maybe this was the year for that,"" said Jeff Kaufmann, the state's GOP chair. ""But I don't think retail politics, building a political machine and doing all 99 counties is every going to be out of date in this state.""
Trump spent a total of two nights in Iowa hotels, jetting in and out on a private plane for a rally every few days. Rubio blanketed the state in television ads, seeing campaign events as not as efficient a use of time as a XXX News hit or a super PAC media buy. Cruz aides stress that they layered a serious data and paid media campaign onto the infrastructure, but the bedrock of Cruz's bid here was a strategy that was more timeworn than innovative.
Visiting every corner of Iowa doesn't guarantee anything, however. Mick Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who won the 2008 and 2012 GOP caucuses, respectively, barnstormed the state and came away at the bottom of the pack. Huckabee dropped out before the night was over.
""It will say as much about the process as it does about the outcome,"" said Joseph McReynolds, a Cruz fundraiser and activist, as he observed his candidate work a tiny town two days before voting.
Up to the final hours in Iowa, Cruz's team maintained a sense of serenity, believing that the outcome's fate was largely out of their hands. Their voters would turn out. The big question that would decide the race was whether Trump's would -- and that was not in the Cruz campaign's control. 

There was considerable worry among Cruz allies and donors that their candidate made the same mistake that bedeviled previous Iowa losers: that he peaked too early. 
Cruz began a slow rise in Iowa polls in mid-October, but by the time he topped them in early January, he had invited the scorn of as many as seven outside groups, and nearly every candidate, including Trump, who was raising scornful questions about Cruz's eligibility to be president.
In addition to Trump's intense trolling and prodding in television interviews, Twitter and other free media, Cruz's campaign estimates that the senator was pummeled by $8 million in attack ads last month.
And some allies and donors concede that those weeks -- rather than days -- on defense took its toll, including concerns pushed by the state's ethanol lobby, who led voters to badger Cruz at nearly every town hall in the homestretch of the Iowa campaign. Supporters differ on the number of points shaved by the ethanol offensive, but they admit it broke through.
Some friends, in retrospect, say the campaign could have been more aggressive toward Trump and earlier. Yet most argue that avoiding Trump's scorn was the closest thing the campaign had to a masterstroke -- nearly every candidate who attacked Trump, of course, crashed.
It was a calculation they never thought they'd have to make. Cruz's win involved a fair amount of luck: Many of the candidates once likely to be top rivals here -- whether it was Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- fizzled entirely. When asked in June about the candidate competing with him most prominently in the evangelical lane, Cruz pointed to a candidate who ended up flirting with invisibility and dropped out Monday night: Mike Huckabee. 
In the final moments, an old threat reappeared: Rubio. Trump had pulled away in some early polls, and Rubio began to inch up in some public polls. Cruz's super PACs, both weary Rubio's rise but also seeing his supporters as soft, began to target him aggressively. The campaign reassigned all of its advertising in the final days to hold off Rubio, once a vanquished opponent, instead.
John Thompson, an unaligned Iowa GOP central committee member, said Cruz undoubtedly faded in the final weeks here. But the fundamentals of Cruz's bid, he said, charted a new Iowa path.
""He took the best out of every textbook that's ever been written,"" Thompson said, ""and I think he made a new game.""",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN
55,55,2009,Ted Cruz tries to seize Rand Paul's libertarian mantle,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/ted-cruz-new-hampshire-rand-paul/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.1,11.2,"Goffstown, New Hampshire (XXX)  Ted Cruz isn't in Iowa anymore. 
Gone Wednesday morning was the vow to investigate Planned Parenthood. In was the punch line about the White House tapping your cell phone. 
The Texas senator, who barnstormed Iowa with a preacher's pitch that carried him to victory Monday, unveiled a new stump speech here that signaled a new profile he will try to build as a government-fearing, gun-hugging outsider who will protect New Hampshire from the evils of Washington. 
Making things easier Wednesday: Rand Paul quit the race. 
Winning libertarian voters has been a centerpiece of the New Hampshire strategy for Cruz, who has flirted with the GOP's libertarian views on foreign policy. Cruz has argued that he is the natural inheritor of the modern libertarian movement built by Ron Paul, which was especially resonant here in New Hampshire, where the elder Paul won second place four years ago. And now, with his son's decision to drop out, Cruz's best path to a strong showing in the bunched GOP field here could be to dominate -- no longer split -- that group of Republicans. 
""There are a whole bunch of areas that the federal government has no business sticking its nose in,"" Cruz said to hollers here in Hooksett. ""I will fight every day for you, for your freedom, for your right to run a small business, for economic growth and for keeping government the heck off your back.""
Cruz's entreaties appear to be paying off. A number of state legislators -- in places ranging from here in New Hampshire to the Paul family's Texas -- signed onto the Cruz team. 
One major Republican megadonor, who had been one of the biggest backers of pro-Paul super PACs, Silicon Valley titan Scott Banister, pledged on Wednesday to Cruz as well -- though he said he has not yet decided to give to a Cruz super PAC. 
""I've interviewed Ted, and while we don't agree on every issue, I believe he's one of us,"" Banister said in an email to XXX, ""and libertarians will discover that."" 
Cruz's team at the outset of the campaign saw Paul as a top rival for libertarian-minded voters. But as Paul's campaign lagged amid poor fundraising and diminished national support, Cruz meticulously moved onto his turf, sharing libertarian-targeted videos before some Cruz rallies and working behind the scenes to poach several of the Paul family's most loyal activists. 
And on Wednesday, Cruz offered a new speech that seemed tailor-made for this state's Republican identity. The Texan still quoted Scripture, but his Christian messaging centered more on a federal lawsuit against a Catholic charity than it did in Iowa. He still called for American leadership in the world, but foreign policy on the whole was giving shorter shrift than it has been for months. 
""New England was meant to be the new England, the new land,"" he told the crowd in Henniker on Wednesday morning, ""where we could come and be free and not have government dictate our faith, dictate our lives."" 
And Cruz had several opportunities to appeal directly to the Paul family's network, and he appeared eager to do so. After Cruz finished a media availability here almost entirely about the latest attacks from Donald Trump, Cruz walked away -- but then in a rare display for the disciplined candidate, turned around and returned to reporters when asked a shouted question if he had any reaction to Rand's departure. 
""He and I have been side by side in a great many fights in the U.S. Senate, standing for liberty,"" Cruz told reporters. ""They worked very, very hard."" 
Cruz's new talking points across the southern part of the state on Wednesday scratched the five things he'd do on the first day in office -- moving to U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, looking into the controversial Planned Parenthood videos -- and instead emphasized a more Granite State-hued pitch: celebrating the Second Amendment, sounding the alarm on abuse of eminent domain. 
In a state like New Hampshire, Cruz's team is betting that pays off. His aides are increasingly optimistic about their fortunes in the state after his momentum from Iowa. But their broader New Hampshire goal -- to bury Marco Rubio beneath less well-funded candidates like John Kasich and Chris Christie -- has become a taller task after Rubio notched a stronger-than-expected third-place showing. 
But true libertarians say Cruz isn't dyed-in-the-wool enough. At a tavern here in Hillsborough County, Cruz received two separate questions from friends who identified as Rand Paul supporters until Wednesday morning -- and neither felt Cruz did enough to align himself with the movement. 
Leah Wolczko, a 49-year-old state employee, said Cruz was too hawkish on foreign policy and the use of military force by the president. 
""It's the militancy that gets my hesitation,"" she said, only concluding that Cruz's alignment with the movement was ""okay.""
But he might be the best they've got. Ryan Milner, asked which presidential candidate might be better than Cruz for the movement, came up with a man whose time had passed: ""Ron Paul.""",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN
