Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Tuesday became the first Jewish candidate in history to win a presidential primary election, setting of a familiar mixture of celebration and anxiety among Jews in the United States and abroad, who pondered what his milestone victory meant for the broader Jewish community.

“Did Bernie Sanders Just Grab Jewish Crown In New Hampshire?” asked a headline in the The Forward, which questioned why Mr. Sanders’ victory received less attention as an emblem of acceptance and accomplishment than the selection of Joseph I. Lieberman as the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee in 2000.

The likely reason: While Mr. Sanders was raised Jewish and even spent time on an Israeli kibbutz in the 1960s, he has been muted in his own embrace of the faith. “Generally the Vermont senator seems uncomfortable with efforts to place a Jewish frame on his candidacy,” The Forward noted.

Israeli and Jewish media outlets swarmed over news of his victory, analyzing it for its significance good and bad. The Israeli paper Haaretz noted that Mr. Sanders often refers to himself as the son of a Polish immigrant, rather than a Jewish immigrant. “The Jewish establishment has a hard time considering him one of its own,” the paper observed.

Another Haaretz commentator, Chemi Shalev, worried that Mr. Sanders’ victory, and his firebrand liberal politics, would stoke anti-Semitism: “More than any other Democratic candidate, Sanders fits the bill of the G.O.P.’s favorite Jewish bogeyman, Saul Alinsky.” Mr. Alinsky, considered the father of community organizing, was frequently invoked by conservatives in the 2008 presidential campaign to tar President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who wrote her college dissertation on him.

And despite the symbolism of Mr. Sanders’s winning the first-in-the-nation primary, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency played down the significance. The news organization noted before the vote that New Hampshire is one of the nation’s smallest and least diverse states. After Mr. Sanders won, it said, “An estimated 10,000 Jews live in New Hampshire.”

At his victory address Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders himself did not even note the historic nature of his win.

But The Forward saw the evening as one for the books. “Tuesday night will go down in history as the first time a Jew won a presidential primary,” the paper wrote.",8.0,9.1,56.25,0.0,The New York Times

Highlight: Mr. Cruz almost certainly became the first presidential candidate to say, “I’m going to stick with Fonzie jumping the shark.” In his first somewhat fractious news conference this trip, Mr. Cruz repeatedly declined to address Donald J. Trump’s comments questioning the senator’s eligibility to be president. (Mr. Cruz was born in Canada.)

BEHIND TRUMP’S ATTACK STRATEGY: Donald Trump made his decision to start skewering Sen. Ted Cruz as his private jet was approaching Nashua, N.H., earlier this month. “Ted is hanging around the top too long,” the Republican presidential front-runner announced on the plane, according to his campaign manager. “Time to take him down.” Mr. Trump’s airborne verdict to strike at his closest GOP rival and a look at other decisions like it reveal a truth behind his famously pointed attacks: Mr. Trump, not his staff or consultants, personally drives them, and they are both calculated and improvised to adapt to news and polls, with little research or extensive prep work.


ANDREW HARNIK/ASSOCIATED PRESS
Mr. Trump proceeded to question whether Mr. Cruz’s Canadian birth disqualified him. A week later, he tore into the Texas senator about a loan he took from Goldman Sachs to finance his political career and about his notoriety as a Senate “nasty guy.” The onslaught seemed to stall Mr. Cruz’s rise in Iowa, where polls show Mr. Trump holding an advantage. In a repeated pattern, Mr. Trump has fired personal attacks at rivals when they emerge as a challenge. While his attacks and policy pronouncements often appear to be off-the-cuff, hours spent interviewing Mr. Trump and watching him behind the scenes show how he plots them, most often alone in his jet as he flies to early primary states.

GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FIGHT TO AVOID WINNOWING IN IOWA: After a year that saw political convention turned on its head, Iowa in a week will finally deliver the first official verdict of the 2016 Republican presidential campaign. Front-runners Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz are mounting a furious effort to place first, while others are vying for a third-place finish in the Feb. 1 caucuses that could beat expectations and slow any momentum for potential rivals. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush trails far behind in Iowa, but the super PAC backing him has spent more than $20 million slamming Sen. Marco Rubio, hoping to damage his fellow Floridian before primary contests later in February. Reid J. Epstein and Jennifer Levitz report.

Plus: Traditionally, the people most likely to show up on a cold, Iowa night for the first-in-the-nation nominating contests have previously attended caucuses. But if Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump can persuade newcomers to turn out, they could gain substantially.

CLINTON’S TACTIC OF EMPHASIZING EXPERIENCE IS QUESTIONED: In her closing pitch to Iowa voters, Hillary Clinton is casting herself as the one Democrat who has the experience to make the life-or-death choices that come with the presidency. It echoes the argument she made in 2008, when she ran an ad saying a president must be ready for a “3 a.m. phone call” warning of imminent peril. It didn’t work then and some people close to the Clintons worry it won’t succeed now. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has narrowed Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Iowa ahead of the state’s Feb. 1 caucuses. He could scramble the race should he notch a victory there and in New Hampshire. His theme is direct: He is the champion of voters who are disillusioned with Washington politics and impatient with an economy that lavishes rewards on a tiny fraction of families. Peter Nicholas reports.
 
VOTERS REACT TO POSSIBILITY OF BLOOMBERG RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY: Opposition, uncertainty and curiosity were among the reactions that voters in early primary states offered upon the news that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg might enter the presidential race as an independent. “I don’t know him very well,” said Juni Pierce, 73 years old, a retired gym teacher from Merrimack, N.H., who added that she believed the Republican-turned-Independent is now a Democrat. A gambit by Mr. Bloomberg, who wouldn’t face voters until the general election, would likely rest on his ability to attract centrists from both parties who admire his tight fiscal policies and liberal social attitudes. Among voters from across the political spectrum interviewed over the weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire, solid Republicans largely turned up their noses. Heather Haddon and Jennifer Levitz report.

WHAT WE’RE READING AROUND THE WEB

The Weekly Standard’s Michael Warren accompanied Sen. Ted Cruz  on a tour of New Hampshire and found an improved political performer: He’s gotten better at telling jokes, and is “becoming more skilled at answering questions that might deviate from his preferred script.”

Little-remembered Morry Taylor, a corporate executive who mounted his own quixotic, Donald Trump-like bid for president in 1996, tells Bloomberg’s Laurence Arnold that “he’d like to see a Trump-Carly Fiorina ticket, because CEOs ‘understand incompetency,’ which is what presidents must tackle throughout the federal bureaucracy.”

The Washington Examiner’s Byron York writes about his recent visit to New Hampshire, where he spoke with Republicans including former Gov. John Sununu who don’t understand the Trump phenomenon and say the polls may be wrong. He concludes that they may not understand it because “if it is real, it would say something about their state that they don’t quite understand.”

Although the New Hampshire tradition of trial by town meeting seems diminished in the 2016 presidential primary race, the primary’s “old ways and old role” are far from dead because the roots just run too deep, writes David M. Shribman in an essay on the primary’s history and distinct characteristics in the Boston Globe.

In the XXX’s Think Tank, Stephen Sestanovich says a retired British judge was wrong to say in a newly released report that Russian President Vladimir Putin “probably” ordered the poisoning death of one of his domestic enemies in London: “Fingering Mr. Putin is a leap—not a crazy leap; just one without the firm foundation on which the rest of the report rests.”

90,90,278,"First Draft: Rudy Giuliani, Although Friends With Donald Trump, Is Not Ready to Endorse Yet",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/rudy-giuliani-although-friends-with-donald-trump-is-not-ready-to-endorse-yet/,trump,nyt,Immigration,4.0,6.4,"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York,  is an admirer of Donald J. Trump and has been friends with him for decades. His endorsement could be useful to Mr. Trump, both as an affirmation in national security terms and an appeal to transplanted New Yorkers in Florida and elsewhere. 

But while Mr. Giuliani speaks with Mr. Trump regularly, and has done so for months, he does not consider himself an adviser and is not yet ready to endorse any of the candidates. 

“I wouldn’t call it advising him,” Mr. Giuliani said in a telephone interview on Monday after a published report suggested he has recently emerged as a key adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani added, “I’m not sure who I’m going to endorse,” though he said he was open to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, but “not Cruz,” he said, referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump’s chief rival so far.

Mr. Giuliani was mayor for eight years and before that the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where Mr. Trump has been a major figure since the late 1980s. 

“I talk to him on a pretty regular basis,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I don’t consider myself an adviser. I’ve talked to Donald for 25 years. So I talk to him a lot anyway.” 

Mr. Giuliani said he frequently spoke with Jeb Bush when he was a candidate, about as frequently as he did to Mr. Trump, and that he spoke more frequently with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with whom he is also friends. 

As for Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani said he would call and offer his thoughts and advice on a range of topics. “Sometimes he takes it, sometimes he doesn’t,” Mr. Giuliani said. He told Mr. Trump that he thought his statement during his campaign kickoff speech that Mexican immigrants were rapists and were bringing crime into the country “was backwards,” although he thought he had “a pretty good point about illegal immigration.” 

He said he also still considered former President George W. Bush “one of my heroes,” and disagreed with Mr. Trump’s assertions that the Bush administration has mishandled the invasion of Iraq in 2003. 

But Mr. Giuliani, who was heralded for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and ran for president himself in 2008, said Mr. Trump had made a valuable case about China’s currency manipulation. He  said he also valued what Mr. Trump had said about the terrorism threats of the Islamic State.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio are “more flexible people” than Mr.  Cruz, Mr. Giuliani said. “They’re not rigid ideologues.” 

He added of Mr. Trump, “You don’t succeed in business by being a rigid ideologue.”",6.4,4.0,85.69,0.0,The New York Times
109,109,129,"Donald Trump, Despite Impieties, Wins Hearts of Evangelical Voters",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/donald-trump-despite-impieties-wins-hearts-of-evangelical-voters.html,trump,nyt,Abortion,8.7,8.8,"OKLAHOMA CITY —  It is one of the prime paradoxes of the 2016 election: A twice-divorced candidate who has flaunted his adultery, praised Planned Parenthood and admitted to never asking for God’s forgiveness is the favorite of the Christian right.

The candidate, Donald J. Trump, who won with evangelical voters in South Carolina and has their support in other Bible Belt states that will vote in primaries on Tuesday, has dominated the Republican campaign by appealing to the economically disenfranchised. But the promise of a Trump presidency that would gall the political elites is also resonating with the culturally disenfranchised, including many conservative Christians.

Mr. Trump’s success with evangelicals, who constitute the largest Republican blocs in six Southern states voting on Tuesday, poses a mortal threat to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose campaign is built on these voters. Mr. Cruz will face nearly insurmountable odds if he fails to carry more than his home state on Super Tuesday, with the race afterward moving to less favorable territory.

Mr. Trump’s appeal with the religious right is debunking some long-held maxims about evangelical voters, showing that they are not monolithic; that they do not fall neatly in step with evangelical leaders, many of whom endorsed Mr. Cruz; and that within evangelical ranks lie fault lines of class and culture.

“Social conservatives are taking a look at Trump and saying he’s not with me on all these issues, but the overall larger imperative for us is to tear down this system that has not served us for a very long time,” said Gregg Keller, a former executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which was founded by the Christian conservative Ralph Reed.

In speeches, including one in Oklahoma City on Friday, Mr. Trump almost never talks about issues that politicians seeking evangelical support thunder about: abortion, religious liberty and, recently, the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice.

Practically the only part of a Trump stump speech aimed at faith-driven voters is a promise that shopkeepers will again be able to say Merry Christmas. It is one of his most reliable applause lines.

Mr. Trump is winning with evangelicals, as he does with other Republican primary voters, by promising uncompromising immigration and trade policies and a hard-driving leadership style. “Evangelicals see all that’s going down, and they just like somebody to be strong and stern and consistent on issues,” said J. Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and onetime Baptist pastor, before Mr. Huckabee quit the race.

A CBS News poll of Republican primary voters nationally this month showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz among evangelicals 33 percent to 22 percent.

In South Carolina, where Mr. Trump won a commanding victory, earning all 50 delegates, he carried evangelicals by six percentage points over Mr. Cruz and 11 percentage points over Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to exit polls.

After Mr. Cruz’s brutal South Carolina loss, his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, re-emphasized a Southern strategy, the cornerstone of Mr. Cruz’s campaign since he announced he was running. “We’re going to have a big night on March 1 in an electoral map that favors us,” Mr. Roe said.

But even though Mr. Cruz won a plurality of evangelicals in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, he faces uncertain prospects in Oklahoma and other Bible Belt states that will vote on Tuesday. Polls show him trailing Mr. Trump in Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama.

“Not everybody is going to follow just because we say this is what we suggest you do,” said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa who is a national co-chairman of the Cruz campaign.

He expressed frustration that so-called values voters were giving Mr. Trump a pass on issues about his character, such as his mocking of women, as well as his conservative credentials. Mr. Vander Plaats suggested that they were “either hypocritical or uninformed or maybe not interested.”

“It’s not just three marriages,” he said, listing what he called Mr. Trump’s breaks from conservatism. They included donating to Democrats in the past and once suggesting that his sister, a federal judge who struck down a ban on partial-birth abortions in New Jersey, could make a good Supreme Court justice.

“I understand why you’re ticked off at your government,” Mr. Vander Plaats said of evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump. “But if that’s your one rational reason for casting a vote, then I think you lack discernment, judgment and temperament.”

The emergence of Christian conservatives as a force in Republican politics traces to the Moral Majority movement of the 1970s led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who helped put Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush into office. But the older generation has lost political clout, failing to see its favorites win the Republican nomination in recent presidential cycles, while the American mainstream has embraced same-sex marriage and a more secular culture.

Mr. Falwell’s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., now the president of Liberty University, where Mr. Trump called a book in the Bible “Two Corinthians” instead of the more accepted “Second Corinthians” in a speech, has endorsed the billionaire. He cited Mr. Trump’s business record and the strength he projects.

“All the social issues — traditional family values, abortion — are moot if ISIS blows up some of our cities or if the borders are not fortified,” he said, referring to the Islamic State. “Rank-and-file evangelicals are smarter than many of the leaders. They are trying to save the country and maybe vote on social issues next time.”

That sentiment is echoed by many grass-roots Trump supporters who identify as evangelical, though they may not be regular churchgoers.

“You’re voting for a president; you’re not necessarily voting for a pastor,” said Less McNiff, a retired human resources executive who heard Mr. Trump address thousands at the Oklahoma City rally on Friday. “He’s not necessarily orthodox, but I like the fact that he’s strong.”

Linda Sharp, an elementary school music teacher from Moore, Okla., who attended the rally and plans to vote for Mr. Trump, said, “He’s made moral choices that are not stellar, but I lay that against his business plan or the economic growth for America, and I choose that.”

But her husband, Phillip Sharp, who is pastor of Heavenly Heights Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, cautioned those who would argue, like the younger Mr. Falwell, that voters should choose a strong leader rather than a pious one.

“I’m sure the Nazis would have said the same thing,” said Mr. Sharp, who favored Mr. Cruz. “You’ve got to be careful when somebody’s trying to make you great.”

Some Trump supporters seem to wrestle aloud with the seeming contradiction between how their faith guides them and their hopes for a Trump presidency.

“I don’t know that Trump is the person to bring God back into our country, but I think if we don’t we’ll have much bigger problems,” said Renae Ehler, an insurance saleswoman from Davenport, Okla., who planned to vote for Mr. Trump. “The business part of things, I think, is going to make a big difference.”

Paul Smith, a machinist in Oklahoma City, called himself a “total Christian” but said he did not attend a church because “I’ve witnessed too much hypocrisy” in churches. “I’ve been with Donald Trump since he put his hat in the race,” he said. “Basically he’s anti-establishment.”",8.8,8.7,62.68,0.0,The New York Times
