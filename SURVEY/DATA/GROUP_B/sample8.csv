5,5,1387,Bernie Sanders Raised $20 Million in January,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/31/bernie-sanders-raised-20-million-in-january/,sanders,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders raised $20 million in January, a large sum that suggests strong support for the Vermont senator as the first nominating contests approach.
That haul, confirmed by his campaign, is nearly two-thirds the amount his campaign raised in the final three months of 2015. To date, Mr. Sanders has raised $95 million.
The $20 million haul came from more than 770,000 contributions, with an average donation of $27, his campaign said. Mr. Sanders has received more than 3.25 million donations since starting his campaign, a record number.
Mr. Sanders’s rival, Hillary Clinton, has not reported how much she raised in January and is not required to do so until next month.
Mrs. Clinton was expected to have the strongest fundraising operation in the field. Indeed, she has outraised her rivals in both parties, bringing in $112 million last year. A super PAC supporting her candidacy has raised an additional $50 million.
But Mr. Sanders has posed a more significant fundraising threat than expected, raising within a few million dollars of what Mrs. Clinton brought in each quarter.
Mr. Sanders has the advantage over Mrs. Clinton of relying on small donations, rather than on individuals donating the maximum $2,700 for the primary. That allows his campaign to tap previous donors for more funds, rather than finding new supporters. His campaign said Sunday that just 1.3% of its fourth-quarter donations were from donors who had hit the legal maximum.
The campaign has not yet filed its fourth-quarter fundraising disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, nor has Mrs. Clintons. Those reports are due by midnight Sunday.
Working Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in a statement Sunday.
Tad Devine, a senior strategist to Mr. Sanders, said in a recent interview that the senator’s fundraising prowess boosts his credibility going forward.
“Part of our argument if were going to win this thing in the long run is to convince the Democratic establishment that the new model of fundraising that he can do is on a scale that doesn’t jeopardize our ability to run a national campaign,” he said.",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,The Wall Street Journal,Bernie Sanders
38,38,1862,"Increasingly, Iowans Say Their Caucuses Are Ted Cruz’s to Lose",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/us/politics/increasingly-iowans-say-their-caucuses-are-ted-cruzs-to-lose.html,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,6.4,7.6,"ONAWA, Iowa — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas insists he does not want to be seen as the front-runner in the Iowa caucuses. “The only way I know how to run is as an underdog,” he said here after a speech on Tuesday, waving off any Joe Namath-style guarantee of victory.

But try as he might to hold down expectations, Mr. Cruz has plainly become the candidate to beat in the caucuses. Barring new and damaging revelations, many Iowa Republicans now think the only thing standing between him and a victory on Feb. 1 is a groundswell of first-time or infrequent voters turning out for Donald J. Trump, of the sort that materialized for Barack Obama in 2008.

Mr. Cruz has gotten to this point by amassing an energized and growing coalition of Christian activists and anti-establishment Republicans, an extensive organization and a deep reservoir of money. But he is also benefiting from a splintered opposition that lacks either the money or the will to halt his rise.

Some supporters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for example, privately say they believe Mr. Cruz cannot be defeated in Iowa. While those claims may in part be gamesmanship — an attempt to build up Mr. Cruz’s expectations here — more revealing is that neither Mr. Rubio nor the well-financed outside group allied with his campaign has so far spent money on television ads in Iowa assailing Mr. Cruz.

“It does feel like it’s now Cruz’s to lose,” said Matthew N. Strawn, a former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party.

A relatively unimpeded path has left Mr. Cruz the favorite to win the state and emerge as the preferred candidate of the party’s conservative wing. And with a dominant performance here, an unexpectedly strong showing in New Hampshire eight days later and victories in South Carolina and many of the Super Tuesday states on March 1, he could also quickly become something else: the de facto party nominee.

Mr. Cruz, obscured for much of last year by a shifting cast of attention-getting rivals, is relishing the turnabout.

Barnstorming Iowa on a six-day, 28-town campaign tour this week, he is even displaying a touch of swagger. He warns Iowans at every stop to expect tens of millions of dollars in ads attacking him to reach their TV screens and mailboxes any day now.

Joined on his 45-foot bus by a phalanx of aides and a camera crew from Showtime, and with a second motor coach carrying a swelling group of reporters, Mr. Cruz boasted about the fresh denunciations being directed his way. “I guess something has changed,” he said with barely concealed delight.

But what gives his team pause — and what is to many Iowa Republicans the crucial question leading up to Feb. 1 — is whether Mr. Trump will abruptly end his nice-guy routine with Mr. Cruz and begin attacking him in advertisements and behind the microphone at his big, highly publicized rallies.

“I’m a little concerned about that,” Representative Steve King of Iowa, Mr. Cruz’s highest-profile surrogate in the state and travel partner for part of the week, said about the possibility of a Trump offensive. “Trump is so completely unpredictable, we don’t know what he might do campaign-wise. We can’t even begin to think about anticipating that.”

Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Cruz praised for months, has begun to taunt the senator, raising questions about his Canadian birthplace and his faith. But he has stopped short of aggressively attacking Mr. Cruz and has run television commercials about only himself so far.

Mr. Cruz, responding to the birthplace slight on Tuesday, posted a video clip on Twitter from the infamous jump-the-shark episode of “Happy Days,” but has repeatedly declined to say more.

Other rivals have not given Mr. Cruz a free pass: He is coming under attack from the winners of the last two Iowa caucus votes, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. Both their candidacies, which are barely registering in Iowa polls, depend on a strong result in the caucuses. But both men have little money with which to inflict damage on Mr. Cruz — and nothing like the millions that a “super PAC” supporting Mitt Romney unleashed on Newt Gingrich here in the 2012 campaign.

“They’re fighting with rocks against bazookas,” Mr. Strawn said.

Mr. Cruz has become far more entrenched in Iowa than Mr. Gingrich was at the same point in his campaign four years ago. With many conservative activists here feeling a sense of fury toward their party, Mr. Cruz has emerged as the candidate most effectively channeling the boiling anger of Republican hard-liners.

Conversations with dozens of Cruz supporters suggest that the deep dismay Iowa Republicans feel toward Washington is prompting them to coalesce behind Mr. Cruz, whom they see as the only viable conservative contender.

“We need a winner,” Susie Lee, 50, said Monday before Mr. Cruz made a late-night stop at a diner in Missouri Valley. “Huckabee and Santorum are great guys, but they haven’t been in office like Senator Cruz has, fighting.”

Pamela Oviatt of Logan, a Santorum backer four years ago, showed up before 9 p.m. for Mr. Cruz’s 10:30 p.m. appearance. She said there was little talk among activists for any of his rivals. “Cruz is the only one that’s in the political system now that anybody is looking at twice,” she said.

Ms. Oviatt’s distinction about being part of the political system remains a worrisome one for Mr. Cruz’s backers.

Iowa Republican leaders say that he is the preferred candidate among traditional activists. “He’s winning the within-the-system, anti-establishment folks,” said Don Kass, Republican chairman in Plymouth County. But the party leaders also say that Mr. Trump is garnering support from people new to the caucuses.

Indeed, Mr. Trump’s backers here say they are confident that his attacks on the political status quo will bring out thousands of Iowans who have not previously caucused or even registered as Republicans, and his campaign is trying to register supporters as Republicans.

But state party records indicate only modest increases in the numbers of registered Republicans over recent months, a pattern little different from that in previous election years. There are now just over 612,000 registered Iowa Republicans. In early August, there were just over 609,000.

The threat Mr. Trump presents has nevertheless cast a shadow of uncertainty over the caucuses and the party. And that, in its own way, has also aided Mr. Cruz: Mark Lundberg, the Sioux County Republican chairman, said he thought Mr. Cruz was one of the few candidates running who could appeal to the angry Trump legions, should Mr. Trump fall short.

Mindful of this, Mr. Cruz has seldom mentioned Mr. Trump except to praise him. This week, however, he has started invoking Mr. Trump for another reason.

Asked about attacks by some of his rivals, Mr. Cruz observed that Mr. Trump was the target of a similar barrage a few weeks ago. He also told diners at a steakhouse in Carroll to expect “tens of millions of dollars” in ads assailing him to be unleashed in the coming weeks — the sort of onslaught that a true underdog would never receive.

His eyes wandering to a political flier on a nearby table, Mr. Cruz seized on a bit of evidence. “I’m looking at a mailer some of y’all may have seen: ‘Ted Cruz is dangerous!’” he read.

“You know what? To the Washington cartel, to the career politicians there that are getting fat and happy and want the gravy train to keep going, that’s exactly right.”",7.6,6.4,74.19,0.0,The New York Times,Ted Cruz
43,43,1663,"Another Pro-Cruz Super PAC Launches, This One Led by Rick Perry",http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/another-pro-cruz-super-pac-launches-this-one-led-by-rick-perry/,cruz,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.4,8.4,"The network of super PACs backing Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz now has a fifth member.
The new group, called Keep the Promise for Veterans, will be led by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who dropped out of the presidential primary race last fall. Mr. Perry endorsed Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, last month.
The source of the group’s funding has yet to be determined, a spokeswoman said. The family of Texas technology billionaire Darwin Deason has been in talks with Mr. Perry and is considering donating to the group, but doesn’t want to be its sole founder, said Doug Deason, Mr. Deason’s son.
The other four super PACs in the pro-Cruz network — Keep the Promise PAC, Keep the Promise I, Keep the Promise II and Keep the Promise III — are each funded by a different wealthy family, including the fracking billionaires the Wilks brothers and hedge-fund millionaire Robert Mercer. Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, recently flew to Texas to discuss the group with Mr. Perry, who has also met with the leaders of the other super PACs in the network.
At the end of December, the four Keep the Promise groups had about $30 million in the bank. The groups have aired ads on Mr. Cruz’s behalf in early-nominating states including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
“We are excited to welcome Gov. Perry and Keep The Promise for Veterans to help elect Ted Cruz our next president,” said Laura Barnett, a spokeswoman for Keep the Promise PAC. “Gov. Perry’s voice on veterans issues will be a strong asset for Sen. Cruz as the GOP nomination continues to unfold.”
Mr. Perry, an Air Force veteran, will be joined at events by former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell; Taya Kyle, the widow of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle; and Dakota Meyer, a Marine Corps veteran and Medal of Honor winner.",8.0,6.8,73.17,-1.6,The Wall Street Journal,Ted Cruz
44,44,1953,Ted Cruz ad features business suits crossing border,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-border-ad-business-suits/index.html,cruz,cnn,Immigration,8.7,10.0,"Washington (XXX) Immigrants are streaming across our border, and they're wearing pumps and wingtips -- at least according to Sen. Ted Cruz.
The Texas Republican on Tuesday morning released a new presidential campaign ad that showed a different side of border security, featuring actors wearing business suits and clutching laptops and briefcases fording rivers and running through the desert.
The images play as a voiceover runs in the background of Cruz delivering part of his stump speech, where he says illegal immigration would be taken more seriously if the people coming into the country were working different jobs.
RELATED: Trump ad features Morocco, not Mexico 
""The politics of it would be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were coming across the Rio Grande,"" Cruz said. ""Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation.""
The ad will start airing in New Hampshire on Tuesday, according to the Cruz campaign.
Cruz's take on the border comes a day after a dust-up between the Donald Trump campaign and the media over an ad he unveiled about border security, in which Trump used footage from the Moroccan border instead of the Mexican border, as the ad narration implied.
The Trump campaign said that decision was intentional. 
The Cruz ad closes with a line from the senator from the last Republican debate, in which he says: ""If I'm elected president, we will triple the Border Patrol. We will build a wall that works. ... We will secure the border.""
The ad edits the line, however, to omit a dig at Trump.
""'If I'm elected president, we will secure the border. We will triple the border patrol. We will build a wall that works and I'll get Donald Trump to pay for it,"" Cruz said in December.
Candidates and super PACs have been releasing a stream of ads since the new year as the first votes in the primary are just weeks away.

87,87,1285,SHARING TOO MUCH? Video raises concern over Clinton using BlackBerry,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/25/video-suggests-clinton-shared-info-that-would-never-be-on-unclassified-system-normally.html,clinton,fox,Foreign Policy/National Security,13.4,11.2,"A 2013 video, obtained exclusively by XXX News, raises fresh questions about how Hillary Clinton handled sensitive information at the State Department. 
In the video, veteran diplomat Wendy Sherman reveals that in the interest of speed, Clinton and her aides would share information that ""would never be on an unclassified system"" normally. 
The questions surround a 2013 speech in which Sherman compared the technology differences between serving at the State Department in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Obama. 
""Now we have BlackBerries, and it has changed the way diplomacy is done,"" Sherman, who was undersecretary of state at the time, said in the 2013 on-camera remarks. ""Things appear on your BlackBerries that would never be on an unclassified system. But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.""
Clinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. 
The Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. 
In Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. 
The secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. 
""So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,"" said Sherman. ""To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.""
The Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.
Previous email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. 
The State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. 
The conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves ""foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,"" so it was born classified when the emails were created. 
""Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,"" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. ""This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.""
A Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new XXX News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. 
The polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important.
