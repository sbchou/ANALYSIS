19,19,1590,Sanders surpasses 2015 fundraising goal with sizable haul,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/02/politics/bernie-sanders-fundraising-hillary-clinton/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,9.9,10.0,"Amherst, Massachusetts (XXX) Bernie Sanders raised $33 million in the final three months of 2015, his campaign said in a statement Saturday, failing to outraise Hillary Clinton but smashing the goal aides set when the Vermont senator launched his campaign back in May.
Sanders' haul -- which brings his 2015 total to $73 million -- was almost exclusively buoyed by his prodigious online fundraising operation. Aides told XXX that Sanders received over 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.
Clinton's campaign announced Friday that it raised $37 million for the primary campaign in the last three months of 2015, easily surpassing the $100 million goal the campaign had set earlier in the year.
""This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,"" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement on Saturday. ""What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support. We are making history and we are proud of it."" 
The final quarter of 2015 also saw Sanders dramatically increase his spending. According to aides, the campaign ended 2015 with $28.4 million cash on hand. That is only $2 million more than the $26.2 million the campaign had in the bank at the end of the third quarter of 2015, meaning Sanders' operation spent the bulk of what they raised in the fourth quarter.
Much of that spending, according to aides, was focused on building infrastructure in early primary states, including deploying organizers to South Carolina and Nevada, and building the campaign's already existing organization in Iowa and New Hampshire.
For the year, Sanders' campaign spent 61% of the money it brought in.
 
Sanders has long been a formidable fundraiser with deep roots in online and small donor fundraising, but even some of his closest aides were unsure he could raise the money needed to run a presidential campaign when the launched earlier this year. Tad Devine, his top strategist, said that the operation had hoped to bring in between $40 and $50 million by the end of 2015.
Sanders smashed that goal, but in a dramatically different way than Clinton did.
A bulk of Clinton's haul came from fundraisers she or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, personally headlined. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. And the former president headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter.
According to XXX's analysis, fundraisers personally headlined by Clinton brought in at least $22 million in the forth quarter.
Sanders, however, only headlined two fundraisers in the last three months of 2015, bringing his year total to nine, while Clinton's total for the year was 174.
What's more, almost all of Sanders' donors have yet to reach the $2,700 max donation, according to aides, who said Saturday that only around 600 Sanders supporters have maxed out.
That means Sanders' campaign can continue to hit up their donors for small donations as the primary calendar moves along.
Sanders' campaign has also raised big money at notable moments in the fourth quarter. Sanders' aides bragged that the campaign raised $2.5 million in the two days after the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas.
And the day after the campaign breached the Clinton campaign's voter data -- and subsequently sued the Democratic National Committee -- aides said the campaign raised more than $1 million.",9.6,9.5,60.65,-0.4,CNN,Bernie Sanders
23,23,1595,Sanders to release letter from his doctor before Iowa caucuses,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/bernie-sanders-health-records-doctor/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,10.7,10.8,"Charleston, South Carolina (XXX) Bernie Sanders will release a letter from his doctor before the Iowa caucuses on February 1, his campaign manager said Saturday.
The announcement comes after a Clinton-aligned super PAC suggested it would call on the 74-year-old Vermont senator to verify his health, and one day before the fourth Democratic debate, held in Charleston, South Carolina.
The letter, Jeff Weaver said, would prove Sanders -- the oldest candidate in the presidential field who also would be the oldest president to take office -- is in ""excellent health.""
The Sanders campaign's decision came after David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton super PAC able to coordinate with the campaign, telegraphed his plans to call for the medical records this weekend here.
Politico first reported Brock's plans, and a source with knowledge of his plans confirmed his desire to call for the records in a conversation with XXX on Saturday. Brock, who once was a Clinton antagonist, is now a vocal Clinton defender and surrogate. 
The Clinton campaign, despite being able to work with Brock, publicly rejected his plan to demand Sanders' records.
""Chill out,"" John Podesta, Clinton's campaign manager, tweeted at Brock. ""We're fighting on who would make a better President, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test.""
Brock's plans rankled Clinton's campaign aides, who, while happy to hit Sanders over policy, found the call to be distasteful. 
""What the f***,"" a Clinton staffer mouthed when asked about the story. The staffer was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.
 
Clinton's campaign and Brock's super PAC, Correct the Record, began to coordinate in May in a move that many campaign finance experts said tested the limits of campaign laws. The groups cites a 2006 Federal Election Commission rule that states providing free content online for free -- and not producing ads -- is unable to be regulated.
There's some irony to Brock's call, as the 68-year-old Clinton has also come under scrutiny for her own health and age. 
Brock's plans have already been used as a fundraising tool by the Sanders campaign.
""With just two weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, the super PAC coordinating with Hillary Clinton's campaign is reportedly launching one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable: they are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,"" Weaver wrote in an email to supporters.
He added, ""Let me be very clear with you: Bernie is in excellent health. But this personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and elections."" 
XXX asked for Sanders' medical records in 2015 but the Sanders campaign did not respond.
Clinton released a letter from her doctor in July, who stated that the former secretary of state was ""fit to serve as President.""",10.8,10.7,57.61,0.0,CNN,Bernie Sanders
82,82,1060,Clinton: 'I know what it is like to come from behind and win in New Hampshire',http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/politics/hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-bernie-sanders/index.html,clinton,cnn,Abortion,13.0,13.2,"(XXX) Hillary Clinton bluntly acknowledged Friday that is trailing Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, telling an audience at a women's health dinner in Concord that she's been here before and knows what it takes to come back.
""I know what it is like to run from behind in New Hampshire and I know what it is like to come from behind and win in New Hampshire,"" Clinton said, raising her voice at the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws' Pro-Choice Roe v. Wade Dinner. ""So let's go make that happen and win on February 9.""
The comment was the 2016 candidate's starkest assessment of the fact she is looking up at Sanders in the Granite State and a nod to the fact she lost Iowa in 2008 but won the New Hampshire primary a week later.
A series of polls have shown the race in the New Hampshire primary favoring Sanders, the Vermont senator who has made a concerted effort to solidify his base in the state by spending over a month campaigning. A XXX/WMUR poll released Tuesday found Sanders trouncing Clinton in the state, 60% to 33%.
Sanders has responded to his promising polls by arguing that the ""inevitable candidate ain't so inevitable today.""
Clinton's comment came on her one day of campaigning in New Hampshire this week, as much of her time has been spent focused on Iowa.
Although Clinton avoided directly hitting Sanders earlier in the day, she did comment on the fact that Sanders said earlier this week that groups like NARAL, Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign -- all organizations that endorsed Clinton -- were part of the ""establishment"" that he was running against. 
""We need somebody in the Oval Office who really understands that NARAL and Planned Parenthood are not part of the establishment,"" Clinton said without mentioning Sanders, who backed away from his initial comments on Thursday.
Clinton devoted most of her speech to fighting for women's health and abortion rights. 
She said people ""who are so adamantly opposed"" to abortion rights ""have no regard for what women's lives are like.""
""I sometimes wonder whether those who are so adamantly opposed to the fundamental freedom to make your own choices on this most personal of issues are just unaware, ignorant, opportunistic, cynical,"" she said.
As she had before, Clinton also pledged to overturn the Hyde Amendment, a measure that bars the use of federal funds being spent on abortions in most cases. ""As president, I will fight to overturn it,"" she said to the receptive audience.",13.2,13.0,51.52,0.0,CNN,Hillary Clinton
94,94,255,First Draft: Donald Trump Turns His Fire on Nikki Haley,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/18/donald-trump-turns-his-fire-on-nikki-haley/,trump,nyt,Immigration,5.2,6.4,"SUMTER, S.C. — Donald J. Trump, who had kind words for Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina early in the week, ripped into her as weak on immigration on Wednesday after she endorsed Senator Marco Rubio, and the crowd of Trump supporters booed the mention of her name.

“She’s very, very weak on illegal immigration,’’ Mr. Trump said, echoing earlier charges that were a departure from his gentler remarks about South Carolina’s governor in speeches this week. “Very weak,’’ he continued. “She’s very, very weak on illegal immigration. You can’t have that.’’

Ms. Haley, whose endorsement is a major boost for Mr. Rubio as Republicans head to the polls on Saturday, has served as a foil in Trump speeches ever since she urged voters last month to avoid “the angriest voices.” 

Mr. Trump joyfully embraces his anger in most speeches as reflecting the mood of the country. In a speech in Greenville on Monday, he called Ms. Haley, who is popular with South Carolina Republicans, “a very nice woman” and “a friend of mine.’’ He said she had modified her original accusation that he was too angry, which she made in the official Republican response to President Obama’s State of the Union address. 

By Wednesday night, Mr. Trump’s blandishments had changed. So had his audience’s mood. “You know, Nikki Haley gave a speech a couple of weeks ago and she said that we——’’ Mr. Trump began, waving an arm to include the crowd.  

There was a chorus of boos.  

“It’s not good,’’ Mr. Trump said.  Then he flung into his criticism of her.       ",6.4,5.2,77.23,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump
100,100,473,Op-Ed Columnist: Is There Any Stopping Donald Trump?,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/opinion/is-there-any-stopping-donald-trump.html,trump,nyt,Abortion,8.4,8.4,"Over the last few months and even weeks, the question among many flabbergasted Republican traditionalists and incredulous political analysts was when the forces of gravity would catch up with Donald Trump and send him tumbling to earth.

It was going to happen. Of course it was going to happen. You just had to be patient. You just had to be strong.

But in the wake of his victories in New Hampshire and now South Carolina, the question is no longer “when.” It’s “if.” And the answer isn’t clear at all.

Consider this: From 1980 forward, no Republican presidential candidate has won both the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries and gone on to lose the party’s nomination.

And this: Over that same time period, only one Republican victor in South Carolina failed to become the nominee, and that was Newt Gingrich, in 2012. But Gingrich didn’t have Trump’s durable (and sizeable) lead in national polls. He didn’t dominate the race’s narrative and capture an exasperated electorate’s mood the way Trump has.

As it happens, Gingrich was on XXX News on Saturday night to discuss Trump’s latest triumph, and he didn’t say: “South Carolina? It’s a muggy, marshy, inconsequential tease. I bagged it four years ago and all it got me was this gig babbling in the wee hours about election returns.”

No, Gingrich marveled at what he made clear was “a huge night for Donald Trump.”

“Nobody should kid themselves,” he added.

Trump didn’t just win South Carolina, and he didn’t just win it by a margin of 10 points. He won it despite what looked, over recent days, like a concerted effort to lose it. He won it after what appeared to be one of the worst weeks that a candidate could have.

It began at the most recent debate, where he trashed the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and accused him of lying to the American people as he led them into war in Iraq. He sounded like a liberal Democrat. Republican primary voters, especially those in the South, aren’t typically receptive to that.

Over the next days, Trump sounded even more like a liberal Democrat, at least as described by Ted Cruz, who went after him relentlessly, armed with Trump’s own past statements in support of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood.

The week got messier from there. Trump picked a fight with the Pope. Trump picked a fight with Apple. It became evident that no personage or brand, no matter how beloved, was safe from his wrath. You had to wonder what or whom he’d go after next. Kittens? Betty Crocker? Betty White?

Then Trump spoke up for a key aspect of Obamacare before realizing what he’d done and assuring everyone that he deplored every aspect of Obamacare, which paled in comparison with Trumpcare, whatever that might turn out to be.

This prompted extensive commentary on Trump’s inconsistencies and a fresh round of murmuring about an imminent tumble.

But what we incredulous political analysts keep failing to take into account—what I was reminded of when I went to a Trump rally last week and listened hard to his supporters—is that the people voting for him aren’t evaluating him through any usual ideological lens. They’re not asking what kind of Republican he is. They’re not troubling themselves with whether the position he’s selling today matches the position he was selling yesterday or even what that old position was.

They want to try something utterly different—utterly disruptive, to use the locution du jour—and that leaves them, on the Republican side, with the options of Trump and Ben Carson. Trump has the fire.

One woman told me that she loves the idea of a billionaire who is funding his own candidacy and won’t be beholden to contributors and special interests. Wouldn’t that be refreshing? Couldn’t that be transformative? Why not give it a shot?

She’d also been to a Marco Rubio rally and was impressed: what a nice young man. But she’s not in the market for nice and young, not this time around.

Another woman told me that she craves a president who is fearless, really fearless, and that of all the candidates in the race, Trump seems the least bowed, the least cowed. She trusts him to fight. All he does is fight. And a fight is what’s in order.

A man who served in the Air Force and now works as a trucker told me that over several decades, through several presidents, the Veterans Administration has remained dysfunctional and his wages haven’t gone up. If he keeps voting the same way, for the same run-of-the-mill politicians, shouldn’t he expect more of the same? Trump isn’t the same.

Gingrich analyzed his appeal perfectly during that XXX News appearance. “It’s a very simple rule,” he said. “If you think Washington is so sick you want someone to kick over the kitchen table, then you like Donald Trump and you frankly don’t care about the details.”

In an exit poll of voters who participated in the Republican primary on Saturday, there was a near even split between those who said that the best preparation for the presidency was political experience and those who put more faith in someone from outside the political establishment. Rubio performed best with the former group, getting 38 percent of their votes. But Trump performed best with the latter group—and got 63 percent of theirs.

Going forward, Rubio is probably the bigger threat to Trump than Cruz, who won only 26 percent of South Carolina voters who identified themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians despite having campaigned as narrowly and relentlessly as possible for their favor. More of them chose Trump, who got 34 percent of the evangelical vote, and plenty of them chose Rubio, who got 21 percent.

That potentially spells trouble for Cruz in the Southern states on Super Tuesday that he’d hoped to dominate. Rubio, meanwhile, is better positioned than Cruz to pick up former supporters of Jeb Bush, who ended his candidacy Saturday night, and to compete well in states outside the South.

And in the days and weeks to come, Rubio will get even more help and money than he has so far from Republican bigwigs who are desperate to see someone less truculent and divisive than Trump or Cruz burst into the lead. His South Carolina showing redeemed his New Hampshire embarrassment and renewed their faith.

But Rubio hasn’t notched a single victory yet. Trump has notched two, and whether they fully lived up to the advance polling is irrelevant. They’re victories, plural. They’re no fluke, no fad.

Naysayers can’t claim that he’s just a bad gaffe or an ugly revelation away from doom. There have already been gaffes aplenty—if you can call them gaffes. There have been revelations galore.

All Trump’s fans see is someone barreling forward without apology and with a largeness that makes them feel a little less small. They see a winner. And it’s no longer an illusion.",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump
