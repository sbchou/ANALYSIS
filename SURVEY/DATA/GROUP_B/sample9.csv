At many of these stops, he was accompanied by members of National Nurses United, a seven-year-old union, fanning out from a bright-red bus in matching red scrubs to corral potential Sanders votes.

But the union is not just busing nurses into Iowa. The union’s “super PAC” has spent close to $1 million on ads and other support for Mr. Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate who has inspired liberal voters with his calls to eradicate such outside groups. In fact, more super PAC money has been spent so far in express support of Mr. Sanders than for either of his Democratic rivals, including Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission records.

“I do appreciate the irony,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United. “All things being equal, we would rather not be doing this. On the other hand, we want to see Bernie as president.”

Mr. Sander’s unlikely rise to super PAC pre-eminence is, in part, the story of an unusual alignment of strategies by different outside groups, including Republican ones eager to bloody Mrs. Clinton and lift Mr. Sanders, whom conservatives believe will be easier to defeat in a general election. While the nurses’ super PAC is the biggest left-leaning outside spender in the Democratic primary, conservative organizations have also spent at least $4.3 million attacking Mrs. Clinton in recent months.

One recent online ad from the Republican super PAC American Crossroads has assailed Mrs. Clinton for her Wall Street speaking fees — echoing an argument Mr. Sanders often makes against her. Another conservative group, Ending Spending, bankrolled by the Wyoming billionaire Joe Ricketts, has begun a $600,000 campaign in Iowa highlighting Mr. Sanders’s promises to raise taxes on the rich and provide free public college tuition, calling him “too liberal for Iowa.” But the ad’s language and imagery, including a contented-looking superrich couple hugging in front of a mansion and expensive cars, has led some Democrats to believe it is actually meant to bolster Mr. Sanders.

But the super PAC spending by the nurses union also underscores an aspect of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that Mr. Sanders rarely dwells on in his campaign speeches attacking the ruling. The same decision that gave corporations the ability to “buy and purchase the United States government” — as Mr. Sanders put it during a visit to Grinnell College on Monday — bestowed the same rights on labor unions, freeing them to spend unlimited money from their treasuries on election advertising.

While the vast majority of super PAC money still comes from wealthy individuals, union cash — pooled from the dues and contributions of members — has become a critical source of money for outside groups on the left. In 2012 and 2014, unions contributed more than $200 million to super PACs. More than half of it went to union-controlled groups that spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising, mailers, and other “independent expenditures.” So far in 2016, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, seven of the top 20 organizational contributors to super PACs were unions or their affiliates, rather than corporations.

“When you have hundreds of thousands or millions of dues-paying members, you can wield a significant amount of influence,” said Robert McGuire, an investigator at the center. “It’s the flip side of a lot of other spending we’re seeing this days.”

No union has spent as much money in the Democratic primary as National Nurses United, which was born out of a 2009 merger of three smaller unions and has unapologetically embraced liberal politics and movement-building. In 2011, union nurses provided health care at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Lower Manhattan, and the organization has lobbied forcefully for single-payer health care and a financial transaction tax.

When most large labor organizations backed Mrs. Clinton, the nurses were among a handful to support Mr. Sanders, among them the Communications Workers of America and the postal workers’ union. They are guided, the nurses’ leaders say, by the principle that taking care of patients means taking care of the country, too.

“This sick government we have right now is killing our democracy,” said Jean Ross, a Minnesota nurse now serving as of the group’s three co-presidents, at a Sanders event in Des Moines on Tuesday. The union’s bus stood outside a steelworkers union hall, where the red scrubs worn by the nurses speckled a room full of Carhartt jackets and denim. At any given time, as many as 30 nurses from around the country are on the campaign trail helping Mr. Sanders, rotating in on vacation days and weekends.

“We have a bus, he has a bus,” Ms. Ross said gaily. “Nurses get on, nurses get off.”

The group’s campaigning advocacy for Mr. Sanders has drawn charges of hypocrisy from Mrs. Clinton’s supporters. While Mr. Sanders frequently declares that he has no super PAC of his own, he has not publicly called on the nurses to refrain from their efforts on his behalf. He has welcomed their help, thanking the nurses by name in campaign speeches and referring to the union in one recent appearance as a “one of the sponsors” of his campaign.

“This is one of the prime examples of Senator Sanders saying one thing and doing another,” said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. “For months he had criticized super PACs and pledged to shun them in his campaign, but all along he has benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars in independent expenditures from one of those very organizations.”

Mr. Sanders insists there is no contradiction.

“The difference is a pretty simple difference,” Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday. “Hillary Clinton goes out raising money for her own super PAC. I don’t have a super PAC, and in the best of all possible worlds, which I hope to bring about, we will get rid of super PACs, we will overturn Citizens United.”

Mrs. Clinton has indeed helped raise money for a super PAC: Priorities USA Action, a group originally formed to help re-elect President Obama and now run by a former Clinton campaign aide. The group has raised more than $40 million since the beginning of last year, including seven-figure contributions from the kind of billionaire financiers Mr. Sanders delights in lampooning on the campaign trail. A research and rapid-response super PAC, Correct the Record, founded by the Clinton ally David Brock and funded by wealthy liberals, has also taken swipes at Mr. Sanders in recent days over his record on gun control.

Priorities USA has continued to husband most of its money for later in the campaign, however, in anticipation of a major general election battle with Mrs. Clinton as the nominee. Several other liberal groups have spent money on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, including Planned Parenthood’s political arm and the League of Conservation Voters. But those expenditures totaled only $847,000, according to spending reported to the elections commission through Monday, less than the amount spent by the nurses’ super PAC, National Nurses United for Patient Protection.

Ms. DeMoro, the nurses’ union official, scoffed at any comparison between the two efforts, one by nurses, the other by a political operative.

“This is almost a morality play,” Ms. DeMoro said. “It’s Clinton’s David Brock versus Bernie’s nurses.”",9.2,9.1,61.67,0.0,The New York Times
32,32,1668,"Behind Ted Cruz’s Campaign Manager, Scorched Earth and Election Victories",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/us/politics/ted-cruz-campaign-manager-jeff-roe.html,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,5.2,6.4,"For weeks, the labels have hung over Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign like dirty laundry: Deceitful. Cynical. Willing to do anything to win.

The attacks from Mr. Cruz’s Republican rivals have challenged his core campaign promises of integrity and conservative purity, cresting on Monday when he dismissed his communications director, Rick Tyler, for spreading a misleading video about Marco Rubio’s views on the Bible.

“There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom,” a Rubio spokesman said, “that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty.”

The episode threatened to tarnish Mr. Cruz’s brand. But not his campaign manager’s.

As Mr. Cruz has elbowed into the top tier of candidates, his campaign has conspicuously reflected the brand of its principal architect: Jeff Roe, an operative with a reputation for scorching earth, stretching truths and winning elections.

“When you win campaigns,” Mr. Cruz said last month of the man he hired, “the people that lose tend to be unhappy about it.”

Mr. Roe’s home state, Missouri, teems with people who were made unhappy by him.

At 45, with lumbering swagger and drawling parables culled from the family farm, Mr. Roe has steered Mr. Cruz’s onetime long-shot presidential bid into contention.

Mr. Roe’s message has been consistent: Mr. Cruz is the most conservative candidate. His turnout operation is perhaps without peer. He all but guaranteed victory in Iowa, boasting to disbelieving reporters that they would be wasting their time to prepare articles on a Cruz loss.

It was Mr. Roe who hired Mr. Tyler to be the Texas senator’s campaign spokesman. (In an interview this month, Mr. Tyler said he had “learned a lot” from Mr. Roe. “Jeff wins,” Mr. Tyler said, adding, “I don’t think anything we’ve done is underhanded or deceptive or anything like that.”)

But back home, Mr. Roe’s allies and opponents alike have seen a familiar imprint in the Cruz campaign’s recent exploits, which have included a Photoshopped image of Mr. Rubio and the misleading suggestion, on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that Ben Carson was leaving the race.

There was the time, in 2006, when Mr. Roe ran an ad flashing “XXX” to highlight a 63-year-old, wheelchair-using congressional candidate’s former employer’s association with Penthouse magazine. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.

Long before Mr. Cruz tweaked Mr. Trump’s “New York values,” Mr. Roe condemned the “San Francisco-style values” of another opponent in a 2008 ad featuring an ostentatiously dressed black man dancing with two women. Some criticized the spot as racist and homophobic. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.

He was among the first local operatives to tail opponents with camera-wielding trackers and, a decade ago, to investigate the social media pages of candidates and their children.

He has been known to quote Gandhi and ran a blog that trafficked in sometimes-sourced political gossip.

“Jeff Roe does not know the difference between fact and fiction,” said Joe Brazil, a county councilman in Missouri who unsuccessfully sued Mr. Roe for defamation after a 2006 blog post days before Mr. Brazil’s primary in a State Senate race.

The item focused on a sad event from Mr. Brazil’s youth, when, at 17, he killed a classmate in a dump-truck accident. Mr. Roe’s post suggested Mr. Brazil had consumed “quite a few beers.” But Mr. Brazil had not been drinking, the police said, and was not charged.

After watching coverage of the Iowa caucuses from his home in Augusta, Mo., Mr. Brazil said he tried to reach the Carson campaign, hoping to offer a history lesson.

“How could they be surprised?” he asked.

In interviews, Mr. Roe’s clients and current colleagues vigorously defended his ethics. He has helped elect or re-elect 41 members of Congress, six senators and five governors. Surely, supporters say, hurt feelings are to be expected.

“Jeff Roe likes to win,” said Representative Martha E. McSally of Arizona, who won her seat in 2014 by 167 votes.

“Jeff is very intimidating, and he kind of likes that,” said Rod Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker.

“Sometimes he makes people a little bit squeamish,” said Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, Mr. Roe’s mentor. “It is what it is.”

Mr. Cruz’s first experience with Mr. Roe came during his Senate run in Texas in 2012. Mr. Roe’s firm, working for Mr. Cruz’s opponent, produced a flier attacking Mr. Cruz’s legal work for a Chinese company. It made an impression, though Mr. Cruz won.

Mr. Roe, who declined to be interviewed, was quick to establish a distinctive culture at Mr. Cruz’s headquarters in Houston. Top aides were required to move there. (Mr. Roe brought along his wife, Missy, the 2010 winner of the Mrs. Missouri United States pageant; their baby, Remington, named in part for the gun maker; and Mrs. Roe’s parents.)

Meetings begin when he sounds a siren on a bullhorn. They last 10 to 12 minutes, largely because the participants stand. And Roe family wisdom is often heard:

“Get the corn down where the chickens can eat it.”

“If you have a bunch of frogs to eat, eat the biggest one first.”

“When it’s raining soup, put a bowl on your head.”

Though Mr. Roe and Mr. Cruz share a conservative vision, there are differences between the candidate and his message maker.

Mr. Cruz is a practitioner of the filibuster; Mr. Roe is pithy and profane.

Mr. Cruz was an Ivy League debate champion; Mr. Roe worked on his family’s hog farm before joining the National Guard at 17, training with howitzers.

Mr. Cruz tracks his daily exercise habits on a Fitbit; Mr. Roe is built like a baseball umpire, which was once his dream job, and he chews Red Man Golden Blend tobacco, holstering a plastic soda bottle as a spittoon.

Mr. Roe started in politics in 1994, working on Mr. Graves’s election to the State Senate. But umpiring remained a passion. He practiced calling third strikes in the office, using a flourish he called “the chain saw.” He was once heckled at a high school game by the Hall of Famer Whitey Herzog, whose grandson was pitching.

In 1996, he was invited to major league umpiring school. He declined, reluctantly.

“In the back of his mind, he still wonders, would I have made a great umpire?” Mr. Graves said.

When Mr. Graves reached Congress, Mr. Roe became his chief of staff, occasionally earning the ire of the Bush White House. At one administration briefing for the Missouri delegation around 2002, Mr. Roe took issue with an agricultural proposal.

“That’s just bad politics,” he said.

A voice behind Mr. Roe objected. Mr. Roe pressed on, according to several people who recalled the scene, without bothering to face the man.

“That’s just completely out of touch without the reality of Missouri politics,” he repeated.

He was talking to Karl Rove.

In 2005, Mr. Roe left Washington to start a political consulting firm in Missouri. His first presidential work was for Mike Huckabee in 2008; in 2012, he consulted for Rick Perry.

But as Mr. Roe prepared to manage his first presidential bid for Mr. Cruz last February, he faced new scrutiny at home. Days after he ran a radio ad mocking the physical appearance of Tom Schweich, a primary candidate for Missouri governor, by comparing him to Barney Fife, Mr. Schweich committed suicide.

Peers said Mr. Schweich had faced many demons; he also thought the chairman of the state’s Republican Party had falsely spread word that he was Jewish. But some Missouri leaders viewed the ad as a last straw, casting Mr. Roe as the avatar of a toxic campaign culture.

“Politics has gone so hideously wrong,” John C. Danforth, the state’s former three-term United States senator, said as he eulogized Mr. Schweich.

Mr. Roe has expressed condolences to Mr. Schweich’s family and horror at the death, but he betrayed little regret for the ad itself.

“I live in the windshield,” he told The New Republic. “I don’t live in the rearview mirror.”

Such has been his response through the years, more or less, to questions of whether his tactics were fair or foul.

Still, colleagues and even opponents have said Mr. Roe is capable of introspection, of inspiring loyalty and, among competitors, of engendering respect.

Mr. Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker, said he had long since lost touch with Mr. Roe, a friend-turned-adversary, when Mr. Jetton was arrested and charged with assault in 2009, eventually pleading guilty and being placed on probation; in 2010, he faced a grand jury investigation over questions of bribery, though he was not indicted.

Out of the blue, Mr. Jetton received a text from Mr. Roe. “He said, ‘Hey, politics is one thing, but this kind of stuff, you don’t wish for anybody,’ ” Mr. Jetton recalled. “I don’t know that I would have done that for him.”",6.4,5.2,77.23,0.0,The New York Times
44,44,1953,Ted Cruz ad features business suits crossing border,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-border-ad-business-suits/index.html,cruz,cnn,Immigration,8.7,10.0,"Washington (XXX) Immigrants are streaming across our border, and they're wearing pumps and wingtips -- at least according to Sen. Ted Cruz.
The Texas Republican on Tuesday morning released a new presidential campaign ad that showed a different side of border security, featuring actors wearing business suits and clutching laptops and briefcases fording rivers and running through the desert.
The images play as a voiceover runs in the background of Cruz delivering part of his stump speech, where he says illegal immigration would be taken more seriously if the people coming into the country were working different jobs.
RELATED: Trump ad features Morocco, not Mexico 
""The politics of it would be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were coming across the Rio Grande,"" Cruz said. ""Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation.""
The ad will start airing in New Hampshire on Tuesday, according to the Cruz campaign.
Cruz's take on the border comes a day after a dust-up between the Donald Trump campaign and the media over an ad he unveiled about border security, in which Trump used footage from the Moroccan border instead of the Mexican border, as the ad narration implied.
The Trump campaign said that decision was intentional. 
The Cruz ad closes with a line from the senator from the last Republican debate, in which he says: ""If I'm elected president, we will triple the Border Patrol. We will build a wall that works. ... We will secure the border.""
The ad edits the line, however, to omit a dig at Trump.
""'If I'm elected president, we will secure the border. We will triple the border patrol. We will build a wall that works and I'll get Donald Trump to pay for it,"" Cruz said in December.
Candidates and super PACs have been releasing a stream of ads since the new year as the first votes in the primary are just weeks away.

53,53,1743,Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented immigrants,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-deportation-guns-terrorism/index.html,cruz,cnn,Immigration,10.7,9.6,"(XXX) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told XXX's Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump.
Cruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union"" that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S.
 
""No, I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,"" Cruz told Tapper as his campaign bus ambled across northern Iowa.
Trump has promised to authorize a ""deportation force"" to remove those immigrants from the U.S., pledging to do it ""humanely."" Trump has repeatedly charged that Cruz is merely copying his immigration positions, but Cruz has called his plan ""the most aggressive"" in the GOP field.
Earlier this week, BuzzFeed captured Cruz on video arguing that his plan was stronger than Trump's because he would not allow those back into the U.S., while Trump's would.
But on the actual act of deportation, Cruz is taking a softer tact. 
""We don't have any system that knocks on the doors of every person in America,"" Cruz told Tapper. ""We also don't have people going door-to-door looking for murderers. We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement.""
Cruz indicated that he would only deport those who are apprehended, such as those who commit crimes or are caught by prospective employers without having immigrated legally. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement or Border Patrol agents could also apprehend those along the border.
Cruz's comments come at a time when President Barack Obama is coming under fire from some progressives for his administration's recent deportations of families back to unstable Central American countries. Some Democrats, including Reps. Linda Sanchez and Luis Gutierrez, argue that the families should be regarded as refugees, not immigrants.
For much of the campaign, Cruz has repeatedly declined to outline what he would do with the undocumented immigrants. But as his debate with Marco Rubio on immigration grew more heated, Cruz definitively ruled out a path to legal status and then has slowly offered more details about how he would deport those already here.
Cruz also said he did not believe those convicted of domestic abuse should be allowed to buy a firearm, and added that the White House's reluctance to use the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" -- a decision Cruz ties to political correctness -- has directly caused a loss of life.
 
He also rejected fears of a GOP electoral wipeout in November if he is the nominee, arguing that history makes clear that moderate Republicans have never fared well in presidential elections. 
""Every time we do it we get clobbered,"" Cruz said. ""You know, this is no longer a theory. You know, as they say in the tech world, this has been beta-tested.""",9.2,9.1,61.67,-1.6,CNN
72,72,1153,First on XXX: Conservative super PAC to air ad hitting Clinton on paid speech transcripts,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/26/politics/hillary-clinton-pac-ad-speech-transcripts/index.html,clinton,cnn,Campaign Finance,9.9,10.0,"Charleston, South Carolina  (XXX) A conservative super PAC tied to a number of top Republican donors will start airing an ad Saturday that knocks Hillary Clinton for delivering paid speeches to Wall Street and corporate groups and refusing to release the transcripts of those speeches.
The ad, which will air on XXX and XXX through Super Tuesday and was made by the group Future45, is the most recent attempt by Republicans to force Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches. 
""Hillary Clinton gave speeches to the biggest banks on Wall Street after one of the worst financial crises in American history,"" a narrator says over video of a Clinton look-alike opening a check from Goldman Sachs. ""But Hillary won't tell us what she said to those banks. They paid her over 1 million dollars and are contributing millions more to elect her.""
The ad concludes, ""So before you promise your vote to Hillary, don't you deserve to know what she promised to them?""
Clinton's campaign dismissed the ad Thursday as another attempt by Republicans to boost Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's Democratic opponent.
""This is just another instance of Republican Super PACs echoing Bernie Sanders' personal attacks against Hillary Clinton,"" said Brian Fallon, Clinton's press secretary. ""The Wall Street hedge funds bankrolling these ads are propping up Senator Sanders because it is Hillary Clinton they fear the most.""
A coalition of Sanders-aligned progressives and Republicans have ratcheted up the pressure on Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches. Future 45, the group behind the ad, is a Republican super PAC backed by Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, two hedge fund managers, and Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade.
The ad, according to representatives from Future45, will run at ""key times, including election night coverage"" and will have an accompanying digital campaign.
""Transparency seems to be a big problem for Hillary Clinton,"" said Brian O. Walsh, president of Future45. ""First the donations to the Foundation, then the ongoing email scandal and now, as a candidate for the presidency of the United States, Clinton wants to hide speeches she gave while being paid over one million dollars for from the big banks!?""
Clinton spent much of 2013 and 2014 giving paid speeches to a variety of corporations and trade organizations, including some of the nation's biggest banks and Wall Street companies.
A XXX analysis found Clinton collected at least $1.8 million for at least eight speeches to big banks, including Goldman Sachs and UBS, from the time after her husband, former President Bill Clinton, left the White House until she announced her presidential campaign last spring. 
Bernie Sanders, Clinton's Democratic opponent, recently joined the call after refusing to get into it for weeks.
""I am happy to release all of my paid speeches to Wall Street -- here it is,"" Sanders said on Thursday, with a wave of his hands. ""There ain't none.""
Clinton's response to questions about why she won't release the transcripts - which her team required groups to create after every paid speech - has been that she will do it if everyone -- including Republicans -- release their paid speech transcripts.
""If everybody does it, and that includes the Republicans -- because we know they have made a lot of speeches,"" Clinton said.
That answer has been less than satisfactory for many, however.
On Thursday, the New York Times editorial board faulted Clinton for not releasing the transcripts, arguing that ""voters have every right to know what Mrs. Clinton told these groups.""
""By refusing to release them all, especially the bank speeches, Mrs. Clinton fuels speculation about why she's stonewalling,"" read the editorial.",10.0,9.9,59.64,0.0,CNN
