35,35,1825,First Draft: Ted Cruz ‘Super PAC’ Invests Additional $2.5 Million in Advertising,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/19/ted-cruz-super-pac-invests-additional-2-5-million-in-advertising/,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,6.0,7.2,"A “super PAC” backing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican presidential race has invested an additional $2.5 million in television ad reservations in Iowa and South Carolina as the contest hurtles toward the first votes. 

The new ad reservations, which are in addition to $1 million that the group, Keep the Promise I, bought in those states and in New Hampshire, comes as Mr. Cruz finds himself under intense criticism from his rivals, including Donald J. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. 

The first spot, called “Record, not Rhetoric,” is a positive spot depicting Mr. Cruz as the only person in the wide G.O.P. field who will do what he says he will do and who has a record of taking on fights in Washington, a key part of the senator’s message to voters. 

“Ted Cruz is a top-tier contender facing vicious attacks designed to frighten voters rather than inform them. Voters have a reasonable expectation that leaders will have thought deeply and fought heartily long before campaign season. ‘Who can you trust?’ and ‘Who has been there?’ are the same question,” said Kellyanne Conway, the president of the super PAC. 

In a veiled knife-twist at his more vocal opponents like Mr. Trump and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Ms. Conway said that “a record – not rhetoric – shows who likes to fight for us, and who just likes to fight.”",7.2,6.0,75.2,0.0,The New York Times,Ted Cruz
47,47,1704,Cruz changes tune on rounding up undocumented immigrants,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/politics/ted-cruz-illegal-immigrants-bill-oreilly/index.html,cruz,cnn,Immigration,9.1,9.2," (XXX) Ted Cruz moved to a more aggressive deportation policy in an interview on Monday night, saying he would look for and deport undocumentedl immigrants using Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, marking a change from a January interview with XXX.
Appearing on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" on XXX News, Cruz was repeatedly pressed on the specifics of his deportation plans by host Bill O'Reilly, who asked Cruz, ""Would you go look for them, though? As (Donald) Trump would look for them to get them out, would you do that if you were president?""
""Bill, of course you would, that's what ICE exists for,"" Cruz said. ""We have law enforcement that looks for people who are violating the laws, that apprehends them and deports them.""
O'Reilly offered a hypothetical example of an immigrant from Ireland with ""a couple of kids and he's settled into Long Island.""
""And you, President Cruz, are going to send the feds to his house, take him out, and put him on a plane back to Ireland?"" O'Reilly asked.
""You better believe it,"" Cruz said.
Cruz's comments to O'Reilly stand in stark contrast from his previous rhetoric on the issue. 
In a January interview with XXX's Jake Tapper, Cruz had said he would not deploy a ""deportation force,"" as Trump as suggested he would do as president.
""I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,"" Cruz told Tapper. ""We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement."" 
Chad Sweet, chairman of Cruz's presidential campaign, had also said after XXX's Republican presidential debate in December that the Cruz campaign supported ""attrition through enforcement.""
Cruz, winner of the GOP Iowa caucuses, is at a critical point in his campaign, following two significant losses to Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina. He also fired his communications director on Monday for circulating a misleading video about rival Marco Rubio.
His next test is Tuesday, when Nevada Republicans head to their caucuses.

61,61,978,"Ad of the Week: From Hillary Clinton, a Single Message Told Across the Decades",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/us/politics/from-hillary-clinton-a-single-message-told-across-the-decades.html,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,6.4,7.6,"The voice is familiar, identifiable within the first few syllables. But the woman on screen, sporting a bright pink blazer and 1979-era Coke-bottle glasses, is not, at least at first. “One of the areas that I’ve been particularly interested in is the area of children,” she says.

By the fourth clip, though, there is no mistaking her: This is Hillary Clinton, as first lady, giving a speech about the importance of children and families.

Previous Clinton advertisements relied on a male narrator to tell Mrs. Clinton’s story. Now she does so herself. Through 11 video clips in 60 seconds, we watch Mrs. Clinton age, her hairstyles evolve, and her diction take on and then lose an Arkansas twang. But despite the passage of 37 years, she seems to be delivering the exact same speech on a single topic: children and families. It is powerful proof of an extensive record. Moreover, it is a sharp rebuke to those who marvel at how Senator Bernie Sanders has been saying the same thing throughout his career or suggest that Mrs. Clinton is more prone to adjusting her politics to fit the moment.

Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have been trading attack ads over the past week. Mr. Sanders released one insinuating that Mrs. Clinton was beholden to Wall Street because of her acceptance of “millions in campaign contributions and speaking fees.” She countered with an ad criticizing ideas that “sound good on paper but will never make it in the real world.” This commercial, “Children,” interrupted the slew of “contrast” ads with a positive message that stood in contrast with anything else on the air.

Created by Jim Margolis, Mandy Grunwald and Dixon/Davis Media, the ad is a new approach to an old message. Mrs. Clinton’s ads have focused on her record, while Mr. Sanders’s have sought to convey optimism and idealism. Yet with its soft, swelling music and the consistent charge in Mrs. Clinton’s changing voice, this commercial carries an emotional, and somewhat nostalgic, force not seen in her ads until now.

Changing channels ...

A new ad from Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign labels Senator Marco Rubio the “Republican Obama” over his support for immigration and carbon tax legislation. The ad ends with a twist, showing a portrait of Mr. Rubio rendered in the same visual style as Shepard Fairey’s “Hope” poster of President Obama.

In an effort to show a groundswell of support, Mr. Sanders released an ad trumpeting endorsements from unions, environmental groups and newspapers. Sandwiched between two of them is an excerpt from a Des Moines Register editorial praising Mr. Sanders. Not mentioned: The editorial was an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton.

Iowans who have recently heard a lot of Donald J. Trump’s exceptionally New Yawk accent have Mr. Cruz to thank. His campaign and two “super PACs” supporting him all used video from the same 1999 “Meet the Press” interview in new ads, each released on the same day.

87,433 The number of times that ads for presidential campaigns and the super PACs supporting them ran on Iowa broadcast television stations from April 15 through Friday.

89,89,1097,Clinton to Planned Parenthood: 'I will always have your back',http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/clinton-planned-parenthood/index.html,clinton,cnn,Abortion,13.8,12.8,"Hooksett, New Hampshire (XXX) Hillary Clinton on Sunday cast herself as Planned Parenthood's most electable champion, pledging at an endorsement event that, as president, she would always stand with the women's health organization. 
Before a fired-up crowd of primarily pink-clad women, Clinton alluded to the controversies the group has faced since a series of videos by anti-abortion activists were released in 2015. Clinton argued that Republicans would ""accelerate the assault on access to safe and legal abortion"" and that she is the person best positioned to beat them in November. 
""I will always defend Planned Parenthood and I will say consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported and protected, not undermined, misrepresented and demonized,"" Clinton said. ""As your president, I will always have your back.""
Clinton has grown fond of the electability argument in recent weeks because it allows her to both directly hit Republicans -- as she did on Sunday -- and subtly knock Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her chief rival for the Democratic nomination. 
""We need a Democratic nominee who will be able to beat the Republicans and get the job done for Americans,"" Clinton said before asking the audience that ""the next president would easily appoint more than one justice to the Supreme Court.""

""That fight is not over either. Access to affordable birth control is still hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court,"" Clinton said. ""If a Republicans wins this election and gets the chance to stack the Supreme Court with right wing justices, together they will accelerate the move to take America in the wrong direction on so many issues that you and I have fought for and many Americans take for granted."" 
Clinton was introduced by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who said Clinton was the ""leader I trust in the White House to make sure women and families move forward.""
""In this election, with the attacks on women's health and rights, more than ever before we don't need a friend, a solid vote, a statement, we need a fighter,"" Richards said about the former secretary of state.
In interview before the event, Richards said that while Sanders has long been a ""very solid vote"" for their organization, she ""could never remember a time where there is a stronger candidate for president [than Hillary Clinton] on the issues that are fundamental to Planned Parenthood.""
Sunday's endorsement was the first time the group is endorsing in a presidential primary.
Planned Parenthood plans to spend at least $20 million in this election cycle and Richards said that will include many ""grassroots efforts"" for Clinton.",12.8,13.8,44.07,0.0,CNN,Hillary Clinton
92,92,219,First Draft: 2 Ex-Presidents of Mexico Say No Way Country Is Paying for Donald Trump’s Wall,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/25/2-ex-presidents-of-mexico-say-no-way-theyre-paying-for-donald-trumps-wall/,trump,nyt,Immigration,4.8,6.0,"At almost all of his campaign rallies, Donald J. Trump leads a familiar refrain as he details his plan to build a giant wall along the border with Mexico.

“Who’s gonna pay?” he asks.

Without fail, Mr. Trump’s adoring fans reply, “Mexico!”

While the Mexican government has said little about Mr. Trump’s plan to beef up border security, two of the country’s former presidents have a message for Mr. Trump: Mexico won’t pay.

“I’m not going to pay,” Vicente XXX said, using a profanity to comment about the wall Thursday in an interview with Fusion. “He should pay for it. He’s got the money.”

Mr. XXX, who was president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, was clear in his opposition to Mr. Trump, calling him “egocentric” and lacking in any political values. Mr. XXX also expressed disbelief that Mr.Trump did well with Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday and called on them to open their eyes.

“I’d like to know who those Hispanics are,” Mr. XXX said. “They are followers of a false prophet.”

Mr. XXX’s successor, Felipe Calderón, expressed similar concerns about the wall this month.

“Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall!” Mr. Calderón told CNBC. “And it’s going to be completely useless.”

Mr. Calderón, who was president from 2006 until 2012, went on to argue that Mr. Trump was misinformed about the flow of immigrants from Mexico to the United States and that closing the border would harm America’s economy.

For his part, Mr. Trump has insisted that as president he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, which he estimates would cost about $8 billion.

On Thursday, however, he appeared to be more angered by Mr. XXX’s tone. Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for lacing his campaign speeches with profanity, called on Mr. XXX to apologize for using foul language when talking about the wall.

“FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente XXX horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!”— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2016",6.0,4.8,78.25,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump
