2,2,1349,Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders Relies on Supporters for Ad About Unity,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/politics/bernie-sanders-relies-on-supporters-for-ad-about-unity.html,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,6.8,8.0,"After letting Simon and Garfunkel speak for him in one ad, Senator Bernie Sanders has turned over his latest to his supporters, several of whom created a 60-second spot titled “Together.”

Only Mr. Sanders’s voice is heard, delivering a clarion call to unite Americans across every conceivable demographic line. But on the screen, portraits of scores of different faces appear and disappear in a blink. Many are ripped in half, as if to illustrate the danger of divisive politics. Old snapshots of families of every possible background flash by. Finally, the two halves of unrelated people’s portraits are merged, to signal the strength that comes from uniting people despite their differences.

Adding to its power is the ad’s back story: It was submitted by supporters of Mr. Sanders and chosen by curators of such content in an effort overseen by his wife, Jane. In a sense, then, others are already taking up the banner of the revolution Mr. Sanders is trying to foment.

That revolution is possible only with the broadest popular support. “Our job is not to divide,” Mr. Sanders shouts. “Our job is to bring people together.” It does not hurt that this message of unity is well timed, as Mr. Sanders seeks to expand his appeal among blacks in South Carolina, Latinos in Nevada and other constituencies as his primary battle with Hillary Clinton expands nationally.

The spot began its life as a short video, shown on a big screen before the band Vampire Weekend performed an acoustic set at a Sanders campaign rally in Iowa City. The crowd erupted as the video reached its conclusion. Since then it has gone viral, earning millions of views and comparisons to President Obama’s 2008 “Yes We Can” ad. Seeing the video’s popularity, the campaign bought the ad on Friday and said it would begin airing it this week.

Election contests are, by their nature, divisive. But amid the testy debates and stump speech sniping, this ad reminds viewers that the campaign is ultimately about everyone — a rare injection of togetherness when the nation is being coldly deconstructed by candidates and their strategists into a jigsaw puzzle in either red or blue.

Changing channels ...

Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign did not know it at the time, but the actress hired to deliver the money line in a negative ad against Senator Marco Rubio — calling him “just a pretty face” — had starred in soft-core pornographic films. When the campaign was apprised of her filmography, the ad was quickly pulled.

Right to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, released a highlight reel of Donald J. Trump’s most boorish moments, portraying Mr. Trump as a coward and Mr. Bush as “the better man.” At the end, it cut to the comically awkward entrances of the candidates at the last debate: With Mr. Trump oddly waiting in the wings with Ben Carson, Mr. Bush emerges from behind them, pats Mr. Trump on the shoulder, then cocks an eyebrow and smirks as he strides by, never looking back.

A 1992 hip-hop song, “Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta,” found immortality on the soundtrack of the cult-favorite film “Office Space” in 1999. Mr. Cruz’s campaign, continuing a string of satirical ads, spoofed the song in a spot mocking Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. “Damn it feels good to be a Clinton,” the lyrics say.

55,55,2009,Ted Cruz tries to seize Rand Paul's libertarian mantle,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/ted-cruz-new-hampshire-rand-paul/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.1,11.2,"Goffstown, New Hampshire (XXX)  Ted Cruz isn't in Iowa anymore. 
Gone Wednesday morning was the vow to investigate Planned Parenthood. In was the punch line about the White House tapping your cell phone. 
The Texas senator, who barnstormed Iowa with a preacher's pitch that carried him to victory Monday, unveiled a new stump speech here that signaled a new profile he will try to build as a government-fearing, gun-hugging outsider who will protect New Hampshire from the evils of Washington. 
Making things easier Wednesday: Rand Paul quit the race. 
Winning libertarian voters has been a centerpiece of the New Hampshire strategy for Cruz, who has flirted with the GOP's libertarian views on foreign policy. Cruz has argued that he is the natural inheritor of the modern libertarian movement built by Ron Paul, which was especially resonant here in New Hampshire, where the elder Paul won second place four years ago. And now, with his son's decision to drop out, Cruz's best path to a strong showing in the bunched GOP field here could be to dominate -- no longer split -- that group of Republicans. 
""There are a whole bunch of areas that the federal government has no business sticking its nose in,"" Cruz said to hollers here in Hooksett. ""I will fight every day for you, for your freedom, for your right to run a small business, for economic growth and for keeping government the heck off your back.""
Cruz's entreaties appear to be paying off. A number of state legislators -- in places ranging from here in New Hampshire to the Paul family's Texas -- signed onto the Cruz team. 
One major Republican megadonor, who had been one of the biggest backers of pro-Paul super PACs, Silicon Valley titan Scott Banister, pledged on Wednesday to Cruz as well -- though he said he has not yet decided to give to a Cruz super PAC. 
""I've interviewed Ted, and while we don't agree on every issue, I believe he's one of us,"" Banister said in an email to XXX, ""and libertarians will discover that."" 
Cruz's team at the outset of the campaign saw Paul as a top rival for libertarian-minded voters. But as Paul's campaign lagged amid poor fundraising and diminished national support, Cruz meticulously moved onto his turf, sharing libertarian-targeted videos before some Cruz rallies and working behind the scenes to poach several of the Paul family's most loyal activists. 
And on Wednesday, Cruz offered a new speech that seemed tailor-made for this state's Republican identity. The Texan still quoted Scripture, but his Christian messaging centered more on a federal lawsuit against a Catholic charity than it did in Iowa. He still called for American leadership in the world, but foreign policy on the whole was giving shorter shrift than it has been for months. 
""New England was meant to be the new England, the new land,"" he told the crowd in Henniker on Wednesday morning, ""where we could come and be free and not have government dictate our faith, dictate our lives."" 
And Cruz had several opportunities to appeal directly to the Paul family's network, and he appeared eager to do so. After Cruz finished a media availability here almost entirely about the latest attacks from Donald Trump, Cruz walked away -- but then in a rare display for the disciplined candidate, turned around and returned to reporters when asked a shouted question if he had any reaction to Rand's departure. 
""He and I have been side by side in a great many fights in the U.S. Senate, standing for liberty,"" Cruz told reporters. ""They worked very, very hard."" 
Cruz's new talking points across the southern part of the state on Wednesday scratched the five things he'd do on the first day in office -- moving to U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, looking into the controversial Planned Parenthood videos -- and instead emphasized a more Granite State-hued pitch: celebrating the Second Amendment, sounding the alarm on abuse of eminent domain. 
In a state like New Hampshire, Cruz's team is betting that pays off. His aides are increasingly optimistic about their fortunes in the state after his momentum from Iowa. But their broader New Hampshire goal -- to bury Marco Rubio beneath less well-funded candidates like John Kasich and Chris Christie -- has become a taller task after Rubio notched a stronger-than-expected third-place showing. 
But true libertarians say Cruz isn't dyed-in-the-wool enough. At a tavern here in Hillsborough County, Cruz received two separate questions from friends who identified as Rand Paul supporters until Wednesday morning -- and neither felt Cruz did enough to align himself with the movement. 
Leah Wolczko, a 49-year-old state employee, said Cruz was too hawkish on foreign policy and the use of military force by the president. 
""It's the militancy that gets my hesitation,"" she said, only concluding that Cruz's alignment with the movement was ""okay.""
But he might be the best they've got. Ryan Milner, asked which presidential candidate might be better than Cruz for the movement, came up with a man whose time had passed: ""Ron Paul.""",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN,Ted Cruz
57,57,1745,Cruz's 2016 strategy focuses on turning out white voters,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-02-05-US--GOP%202016-Cruz-White%20Turnout/id-b92587c622404c15b18976ec822c1a91,cruz,ap,Immigration,11.5,10.4,"(XXX)  Ted Cruz has mapped out a path to the White House that all but ignores the explosion of minority voters in America.
The Texas senator's general election strategy depends almost wholly upon maximizing turnout among millions of conservative white voters  mostly evangelical Christians and the white working class  who didn't participate in the last presidential contest.
At the same time, Cruz's team is banking on a sharp decline in black and Hispanic support for the 2016 Democratic nominee, whoever it is, returning to voter trends before Barack Obama shook up the electorate as the nation's first black president and won an overwhelming share of support from non-white voters.
It is a strategy that defies the conventional wisdom in the GOP that says the party can win the White House again only if it appeals to political moderates and non-white voters who are becoming a greater share of the voting-age population as each day passes.
""I'm an outlier,"" said longtime Cruz aide Jason Johnson, the chief architect of the Cruz playbook, which he concedes is not in line with modern-day Republican thinking.
Yet with overwhelming confidence born from a year of studying voter trends, Johnson insists the first-term Texas senator can win the general election by motivating a coalition of his party's most reliable supporters.
""It is absolutely the case that in 2012, there were a little over 2 million fewer white non-Hispanics that voted compared to 2008,"" Johnson said this week in an interview with XXX. ""They sat it out.""
The strategy will not be tested unless Cruz survives the long road ahead in his party's hotly contested nomination process to represent the GOP in November's general election. Still, general election viability has emerged as a major theme in the days leading up to New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary among the leading Republican candidates.
Many Washington Republicans warn that Cruz is simply too conservative to appeal to the wide swath of voters that typically decide general elections.
""They are just wrong about this,"" said Republican operative Matthew Dowd, who served as the chief political strategist for George W. Bush. ""It is about both motivation and persuasion. You can't motivate your base and at same time turn off moderates and independents.""
But Cruz this week repeatedly declared that his team assembled a coalition in Iowa that would translate into general election success.
""We saw conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats all coming together,"" he said during a town hall-style meeting at a Portsmouth Toyota dealership. ""If we're going to win, if we're going to win the nomination and we're going to win the general election, we've got to bring that coalition together.""
""That's what it's going to take to win the general election,"" he said.
The Cruz strategy is born by necessity.
While his team notes he won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 2012 Senate election in Texas, and Cruz has the potential to become the nation's first Hispanic president, hardline conservative rhetoric on illegal immigration has defined his short political career. He has promoted endorsements from far-right conservatives such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, Cruz's national campaign co-chairman who has compared immigrants in the country illegally to drug mules and livestock.
GOP leaders commissioned an exhaustive report after the 2012 elections calling for candidates to adopt more welcoming tones on immigration. But a hardline stance on immigration remains popular among white voters across America who make up the majority  albeit a shrinking majority  of the voting-age population and tend to vote Republican.
Trump's sustained popularity is based in part on such anti-immigrant rhetoric. And more than 60 percent of Republicans polled by XXX last summer said the U.S. government should focus on stopping the flow of immigrants in the country illegally and deporting those already here. About 30 percent of Democrats said the same.
Johnson, Cruz's top strategist, believes that Cruz can win in November even if he earns only 30 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally  a modest increase from Mitt Romney's 27 percent four years ago. And among black voters, Johnson envisions Cruz winning over roughly 10 percent, which is in line with the GOP's performance in 2000 and 2004.
Cruz has no plans to back off his hardline stance on immigration. His team has determined there is no evidence that immigration policy alone is a major factor win winning over Hispanic voters.
""It's not a panacea,"" Johnson said of immigration reform, citing internal and public polling. ""Even if we had to do better than 30 percent, that wouldn't do it.""
Yet the country's demographic shifts have prompted some Republicans to reach the opposite conclusion and work harder to appeal to non-white voters, who by 2052 will make up a majority of the eligible voting-age population, according to a study by conducted last year by Washington think tanks representing both parties.
GOP leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and recently departed presidential candidate Rand Paul have spoken extensively about poverty alleviation and criminal justice reform  issues that particularly resonate among black and Hispanic voters.
The share of all voters nationwide who are white has dropped consistently since 1996, according to census data. Even 2004, a year in which the total number of white voters increased by more than 10 million, failed to reverse that trend.
Yet Cruz's team is correct to note that millions of white voters sat out the 2012 elections. Census voting data shows about 2 million fewer white voters cast ballots in 2012 than 2008  the only time since 1996 that the total number of votes cast by a racial group has decreased from one presidential election to the next.
Some Republican strategists, including Dowd, suggest the missing voters are concentrated in states that aren't likely to be contested in the general election. They argue that even if Cruz gets them to vote, they won't improve his November prospects.
Cruz's team won't ignore minority voters altogether. The campaign has an African-American outreach director, and Cruz this week promised to campaign in Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods at some point. His major challenge is to drive white turnout while not completely alienating minorities.
""You can't just go out and throw red meat on the table just because you know it will help turnout on one side of the equation,"" he said. ""We're either right or wrong.""

79,79,1239,Op-Ed Columnist: Hillary Clinton Stumbles,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/opinion/hillary-clinton-stumbles.html,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,11.1,11.2,"In October, when Hillary Clinton made a spectacle of the congressional Benghazi committee during a marathon interrogation that seemed designed to make a spectacle of her, she emerged stronger than ever. Her polls numbers surged.

That performance had come on the heels of a strong debate performance the week before in the first Democratic presidential debate.

She had bolstered the image she wanted to project: strong, smart, capable and battle-tested.

But now, on the verge of Monday night’s Democratic town hall in Iowa — the last time the candidates will face off before the caucuses in that state — and with Bernie Sanders’s poll numbers climbing not only in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign seems increasingly desperate and reckless.

I noticed the turn in the last debate as Clinton seemed to me to go too far in her attacks on Sanders, while simultaneously painting herself into a box that will be very hard to escape.

She wrapped herself in President Obama’s legacy so tightly that she could hardly breathe, and then built an image of herself as a practical politician who could build on Obama’s accomplishments by taking small steps and negotiating tough deals.

But practicality and incrementalism, as reasonable as that strategy and persona may be, are simply no match for what animates the Sanders campaign — a kind of kinetic, even if sometimes overblown, idealism. His is a passionate exposition of liberalism — and yes, democratic socialism — in its most positive light.

But, let me be clear and unequivocal: I find his earnest philosophic positions to be clear and often laudable, but also somewhat quixotic. I think that he is promising far more than even he knows he can deliver, and the electability question is still a real one, even though polls now show him matching up well against possible Republican opponents.

For instance, Sanders’s plan for universal health care is an admirable ambition of any true liberal, but as presented seems to me unworkable, and the prospect of getting it passed through this Congress or any Congress that vaguely resembles it is nil. Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare, which is far shy of Sanders’s proposal, more than 60 times. Suggesting that it would pass something even more expansive is mere fantasy.

When Sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a “political revolution,” which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the Senate and possibly the House.

Interesting, but also unlikely. Go talk to all the Blue Dog Democrats who lost their seats in the wake of Obamacare passage. Go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. Go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure Republican leadership, and therefore prevent Medicaid from being expanded in their states.

There are political realities that exist in America that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.

Furthermore, Sanders likes to tout that he doesn’t have a “super PAC” and doesn’t want one. That is a principled position. But the Republican candidate will have the support of many super PACs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the Republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. They are going to beat Sanders like a he is a nail with the “socialist” label and his proposal on new taxation. Middle of the spectrum Middle America is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.

But instead of Clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than Sanders’s, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about Sanders’s honor.

The swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-Obama because he wanted Obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap Obamacare, simply do not connect.

Sanders may be a dreamer, but he’s not dishonorable. Trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.

There are a tremendous number of echoes starting to be heard between the way Clinton ran against Obama, and the way she is running against Sanders.

Clinton has what political insiders call the “firewall”: Overwhelming support among black and Hispanic voters in Southern and some Western states. But a win by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could supply a boost of momentum that could greatly erode the Clinton firewall.

If Clinton can’t find a positive, energetic message to project, and soon, she is going to be swept away by Sanders.

Some part of Sanders’s proposals and even his vision for this country may indeed be a fairy tale. But in the 2008 race, Bill Clinton criticized Obama and his position on the Iraq war as a “fairy tale.” Well fairy tales sometimes come true, particularly when Hillary Clinton stumbles.",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,The New York Times,Hillary Clinton
103,103,527,"Really, Donald Trump? A fight with the Pope?",http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/opinions/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-dantonio/index.html,trump,cnn,Immigration,8.7,8.8,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (XXX)  Donald Trump once told me, ""I always loved to fight.""  But even those of us who know him and his fighting mentality have to marvel at his ability to find new battles. I mean really, Donald, you're going to argue with the Pope? About Christianity?
To be fair, from the Trumpian viewpoint, Pope Francis sort of started it. He decided to make a pilgrimage to Mexico and to include a visit to the border where Trump proposes to build a huge wall to keep people out. A champion of the poor and the suffering, Francis has visited slums all over the world and washed the feet of homeless men and women. 
But for Trump, the trip to Mexico, where just about everyone is Catholic and about half the population lives in poverty, was a step too far.    
""I think that the Pope is a very political person,"" Trump said in a TV interview last week. 
He then wondered whether maybe Francis was a pawn of the Mexican government. ""I don't think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico,"" said Trump. ""I think Mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is. They're making a fortune, and we're losing.""
Trump's pre-emptive strike, made before the Pope even left Rome, was a play for votes in South Carolina, where religious tradition includes longstanding suspicions about the Catholic Church.  Criticizing the Pope also gave Trump yet another turn in the media spotlight, which is a place he finds quite comfortable. 
Besides, who else was the fighter going to tangle with? 
His Republican opponents seem incapable of giving Trump a real contest, and nobody in the news media was causing him to sweat. Trump was probably getting bored. Thanks to Francis, he's not bored now.
Though as different from Trump as love is from anger, Francis is similar to him in one way: He says what he thinks. Early in his papacy, he shocked fellow Catholics when reporters asked him about homosexuality -- a subject long anathema to the Vatican -- and he answered, ""Who am I to judge?"" 
When told of Trump's criticisms as he flew home from Mexico on Thursday, the Pope said, ""Thank God he said I am a political man. Because Aristotle defines a human being as a political animal: At least I am a human being. Am I a pawn? Well maybe. I will leave that up to your judgment. And a person who only thinks about making wall, wherever it may be, and not building bridges, is not a Christian."" 
Like Trump, the Pope does not speak without purpose. 
He has doubtlessly followed the American presidential campaign more closely that Trump has followed the news from the Vatican. And just as Trump fights to win whatever prize he has in mind, the Pope has fought doggedly on behalf of the poor.
He has criticized world leaders for failing to lift-up humanity, and he has chastised leaders of his own Church for living lavishly while members of their flocks suffer.  His Christianity is defined by the Jesus who threw the money changers out of the temple. 
In his own effort to be Christian, he aligns himself with refugees and victims of drug trafficking and has expressed that he would err on the side of open arms and open borders.  This has been his response to the refugee crisis in Europe. Is it any wonder he would criticize Trump's plan mass deportations and massive wall? 
In this latest controversy, Trump, has followed his usual strategy of keeping up the fight, no matter what.
He answered the Pope by saying: ""He doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation"" and complaining that ""for a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. ... No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn, and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant."" 
Of course, Francis considers Christianity his area of expertise in the same way that Trump imagines that money and power are his. And he is less inclined than Trump to be shy about stating his beliefs. When he celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus, last December, he offered a very un-Trumpian homily that included this:
""In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this Child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential. ... Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy, drawn daily from the wellspring of prayer.""
Maybe Trump heard the Christmas homily and took it personally. Maybe he understood that the Pontiff -- Latin for bridge-builder -- would join the battle of ideas. 
Certainly Francis is not likely to back down. He is as transformational for the church as Trump is in politics. Humble and empathetic, he might apologize for hurting Trump's feelings. But he won't abandon his position. He will always prefer bridges to walls.
