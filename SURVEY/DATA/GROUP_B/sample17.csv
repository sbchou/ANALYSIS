1,1,1582,Sanders Plans Volley of Ads in Iowa in Final Push Toward Caucuses,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/27/sanders-plans-volley-of-ads-in-iowa-in-final-push-toward-caucuses/,sanders,wsj,Campaign Finance,6.4,7.6,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Bernie Sanders plans to air a new flurry of TV ads in Iowa, reigniting an argument with the Hillary Clinton campaign about which of the two is waging the more negative presidential bid.
An adviser to the Vermont senator, Tad Devine, said the campaign will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on additional advertising in Iowa as part of a final push to win the caucuses and make a statement that Mr. Sanders can prevail in a state far from his home base of Vermont.
Iowa is very important in terms of a path, Mr. Devine said. If we can do very well there it would sustain the advantage that we have in New Hampshire.
Mr. Sanders and his team had not yet settled on the precise mix of ads to run in advance of Monday’s caucuses, Mr. Devine said. But the ads could include new spots drawing attention to the speaking fees Mrs. Clinton has received from Wall Street banks, he said.
There are not going to be big, negative attacks, Mr. Devine said Wednesday. Thats not in the offing.
What the campaign is considering are 30-second spots that would reinforce an argument Mr. Sanders has already made on the trail: Cash coming from Wall Street to the politicians is causing them to not be able to make decisions that are for the good of the people, Mr. Devine said.
In a news conference in Des Moines on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders reiterated what is a point of pride for him  he would run a campaign centered on issues and not attack Mrs. Clintons character.
Its not what the American people want to hear, he said.
At times, Mr. Sanders has complained that he has been on the receiving end of personal attacks coming from the Clintons. One Clinton ally, David Brock, who founded a super PAC that coordinates with the Clinton campaign, has argued that Mr. Sanderss socialist views would render him unelectable in the fall.
A spokesman for Mr. Sanders countered that Mrs. Clinton should be ashamed of her association with Mr. Brock, a onetime conservative activist-turned-Clinton partisan.
Now its the Clinton campaign that is complaining of unwarranted attacks.
The campaign released a video Wednesday juxtaposing Mr. Sanderss claims that he would run a positive campaign with press reports saying he’s targeted his opponent.
Though Mr. Sanders hasnt insulted Mrs. Clinton, he has compared her to a reviled figure in Democratic circles: former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. He has also suggested Mrs. Clinton is in Wall Streets pocket because of six-figure speaking fees she has gotten from large banks.",7.2,6.0,75.2,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal
41,41,2006,"Ted Cruz: To Help Stop Drug Abuse, Build the Mexico Border Wall",http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/04/ted-cruz-to-help-stop-drug-abuse-build-the-mexico-border-wall/,cruz,wsj,Immigration,8.4,8.4,"HOOKSETT, N.H.  Ted Cruz spent 18 minutes telling an emotional, gripping story of his familys history of drug and alcohol abuse. His older half-sister and later his father, he told an addiction policy forum, got hooked and became addicted. His sister died, his father survived only after becoming religious, Mr. Cruz said in a Baptist church here.
So it was jarring to hear Mr. Cruz then pivot to his policy solution: building a wall along the nations southern border to stop illegal immigration and halt the flow of drugs from Mexico.
If we want to turn around the drug crisis we have got to finally and permanently secure the border, Mr. Cruz said. We need to solve this problem, we need to build this wall.
Mr. Cruzs appearance at a drug addiction forum comes as New Hampshire voters have classified heroin as the states top problem. Rarely does a presidential candidate get through a town hall forum without being asked how theyd address the problem. Mr. Cruz said 48% of residents here know someone addicted to heroin  60% of people who are 35 years old or younger.
To connect with the audience, Mr. Cruz told of his older half-sister Miriam. The Texas senator, who wrote about her plight in his book last year, told of trying to rescue her from living in a Philadelphia crack house and subsidizing her sons boarding school before she died of a drug overdose in 2011.
Sometimes people make decisions, bound and determined, to destroy themselves, he said. You wonder as a family, Could I have done more? Was there a way to pull her back, to change the path she was on? Those are questions you can never fully answer.
Mr. Cruz then placed blame for the drug problem on the various groups he accused of abetting illegal immigration: Democrats (Theres a new politically correct term now for illegal immigrants: Its called undocumented Democrats, he said to awkward laughter) and business-oriented Republicans.

Whats if anything even more cynical is all the Republicans who listen to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who listen to Wall Street, who listen to the lobbyists in Washington, Mr. Cruz said. They think its fabulous. Cheap labor drives down wages, what could be better? But its that political commitment that results in our not securing the border and not stopping the flow of drugs into this country.
Mr. Cruz has made combating illegal immigration a hallmark of his campaign. A onetime advocate of legalizing some undocumented immigrants, in 2015 he renounced that position when rival Donald Trump proposed deporting some 11 million people in the country illegally. Mr. Cruz has cited his opposition to the 2013 Senate immigration legislation that Sen. Marco Rubio co-authored as evidence of his bedrock conservative credentials.
Mr. Cruzs appeared here at what organizers billed as a non-political event to which all presidential campaigns were invited.
Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who is a Hillary Clinton surrogate, spoke before Mr. Cruz arrived. Mr. Shumlin blamed the Food and Drug Administration for approving drugs like Oxycontin, a highly addictive painkiller that can lead to heroin abuse. Oxycontin was approved by the FDA in 1995, when Mrs. Clintons husband Bill Clinton was president.
Following his remarks Mr. Cruz sat on a nine-person panel discussing ways to address New Hampshires drug crisis. He told the group, which included drug counselors and former addicts, that he supports legislation to funnel more federal money into drug prevention programs but reiterated that the problem is one that can only be solved at local levels.
Its not going to be the government that solves this, Mr. Cruz said. Its going to take people on the ground connecting one person at a time. ¦ People have to make personal transformations.",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The Wall Street Journal
63,63,1189,Hillary Clinton Sharpens Focus After Democratic Debate Tussles,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-sharpens-focus-after-democratic-debate-tussles.html,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,7.6,7.6,"After a debate performance in which she painted Bernie Sanders as a fringe candidate whose policies bordered on fantasy, Hillary Clinton and her allies intensified the pressure on the Vermont senator on Friday, burnishing her embrace of President Obama and seeking to solidify her support among blacks.

Following a stinging loss in New Hampshire this week, the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, the “super PAC” that supports her, have sharpened their focus on Mr. Sanders and the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Separately, they have invested in new rounds of advertising intended to blunt any momentum that Mr. Sanders might have gained from his landslide in New Hampshire.

On Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s team unveiled a new television ad that ties her to Mr. Obama on the issue of tightening gun laws — a perceived weakness of Mr. Sanders. It features the Rev. Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed in the Charleston church shooting, praising Mrs. Clinton for “standing with the president” on firearms restrictions.

Despite the fact that Mrs. Clinton has led in most South Carolina polls, Priorities USA is also leaving nothing to chance there. The group announced on Friday that it is starting its largest advertising campaign to date on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf, investing $500,000 to spread the message on radio stations that the former secretary of state is the true heir to Mr. Obama’s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.

“We need a president who will build on all that President Obama has done,” say the narrators of the ad, which will air in South Carolina communities with large black populations. “President Obama trusted Hillary Clinton to be America’s secretary of state. And we know Hillary Clinton has the vision and courage to help build an economy to support our communities.”

Mrs. Clinton is building on the lines of attack she used in Thursday’s Democratic debate in Milwaukee. She criticized Mr. Sanders for disparaging Mr. Obama’s record and accused him of being too narrowly focused on his central mission of breaking up the banks to be sufficiently concerned about issues such as civil rights and criminal justice reform.

The new push from Priorities USA could leave Mrs. Clinton open to more criticism from the Vermont senator, who has lamented her reliance on big donors as a sign that she is not independent. At the debate, Mrs. Clinton tried to separate herself from the group while also clinging to Mr. Obama.

“You’re referring to a super PAC that we don’t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me,” Mrs. Clinton said in response to a question about what rich donors expect when they give money to political action committees. “They are the ones who should respond to any questions.”

A spokesman for Priorities USA pointed out that super PACs support Mr. Sanders, even though he opposes them. Priorities USA is also spending $4.5 million across the South to turn out voters before several states there hold nominating contests on March 1.

In the days leading to the South Carolina voting, Mr. Sanders could also be looking for some new answers to tough questions, as Mrs. Clinton took a more aggressive approach to discrediting his foreign policy knowledge and credentials. In one of her more stinging debate blows, Mrs. Clinton said it was not clear to her who Mr. Sanders was seeking counsel from on international affairs.

Asked to note any advisers, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, pointed to an essay published on the Politico magazine website on Thursday by Lawrence Korb, an assistant secretary of defense during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Although Mr. Korb has only met with Mr. Sanders once, he said he is “serious” on foreign policy.

“In my dealings with him, and in analyzing his record in Congress over the past 25 years, I have found that Sanders has taken balanced, realistic positions on many of the most critical foreign policy issues facing the country,” Mr. Korb wrote.

As the Democrats jockey for position, Republicans, who hold their next presidential debate on Saturday, also have South Carolina on their minds. With their primary election being held a week earlier, on Feb. 20, the sniping among the remaining candidates has reached a fever pitch.

On Friday, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will gather at the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. They will look to court the evangelical Christians that could be crucial to their success in the state.

Donald J. Trump is not attending the event, but as he faces a tight race with Mr. Cruz in South Carolina, he made sure to weigh in from afar. In a post on Twitter, he rebutted a suggestion made by the Texas senator that Mr. Trump agrees with Mr. Obama on same-sex marriage.

“How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” Mr. Trump said.",7.6,7.6,65.73,0.0,The New York Times

HIGHLIGHTS
STATE DEPARTMENT TO WITHHOLD HILLARY CLINTON EMAILS WITH HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION: The State Department said Friday nearly two dozen of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‘s emails contained highly classified information, and it will launch a review into whether they were classified at the time they were sent or received. State Department spokesman John Kirby said that 22 documents containing “top secret” information will be excluded entirely from the release of Mrs. Clinton’s email archive. So far, more than 1,300 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails have been redacted, with portions blocked out, due to the presence of classified information, but this is the first example of emails being entirely withheld from public release.
Mr. Kirby also said the State Department would conduct an investigation to determine whether the emails were classified at the time they were sent or received on Mrs. Clinton’s personal email server. That marks a shift from the longtime State Department position that any classification was done after the fact. Mr. Kirby added that whether they were classified at the time or not, they didn’t contain markings identifying them as classified. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, wrote on Twitter:  “This is overclassification run amok. We adamantly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails.” Byron Tau reports.

INCOME FOR RECENT GRADUATES THE HIGHEST IN OVER A DECADE: The labor market has taken a sharp turn for the better for young college graduates. Incomes for the newest batch of diploma-holders have reached the highest level in more than a decade and their unemployment rates are falling quickly, according to a new economic report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Their experience now underscores a growing divide in the U.S. economybetween those with a college degree and those without. The median holder of a bachelor’s degree, ages 22 to 27, earned $43,000 last year, an increase of over $3,000 from the year before. That is the highest since 2003, showing that the job market for freshly minted graduates has nearly recovered to the best years on record.  Josh Zumbrun reports.
CENTRAL BANKS TRY UNCONVENTIONAL POLICY TOOLS: Central banks around the world are going to new lengths to boost their economies, underscoring both the importance and limitations of monetary policy in a global economy plagued by paltry growth and unsettled markets. In the latest shift, the Bank of Japan Friday joined a number of European peers in setting its key short-term interest rate below zero for the first time. The move, long denied as a possible course by the banks own governor, came a week after the European Central Bank president said he was ready to launch additional monetary stimulus in March, and just days after the U.S. Federal Reserve expressed renewed worry about market turbulence and sluggish growth overseas. Anjani Trivedi and Eleanor Warnock report.
U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT ANEMIC RATE IN FOURTH QUARTER: The U.S. economy sputtered in the final months of 2015, a possible sign of flagging momentum amid global weakness and turmoil in financial markets. Gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic output, expanded at a 0.7% seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. The economy had advanced 2% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter. Despite weak first and fourth quarters to bookend the year, growth for 2015 as a whole was steady. For the full year, GDP expanded 2.4%. Jeffrey Sparshott reports.

83,83,1238,Obama hopes to pave way for Clinton with SOTU,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/12/politics/barack-obama-hillary-clinton-2016-election/index.html,clinton,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,13.0,13.2,"Washington (XXX) It's time for President Barack Obama to start letting go.
While aides say the commander in chief will argue in his final State of the Union address Tuesday that America's destiny depends on honoring progress made on his watch, he will be sketching a future in which he will play no major political role.
So his speech -- likely his last opportunity to grab an hour of uninterrupted prime time -- marks an important first step in a delicate and bittersweet yearlong process of handing over his legacy to the protective custody of his hoped-for successor, fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton.
For sure, Obama has no intention of striding off the political stage just yet -- a factor that could complicate his relations with the Democratic front-runner in the coming months. He is making clear that with challenges including global warming, economic inequality and the still-open Guantanamo Bay prison, he will use every last ounce of authority and influence left to get things done.
Obama to focus on future in his final State of the Union speech
""I want us to be able, when we walk out this door, to say, 'We couldn't think of anything else that we didn't try to do ... that we weren't timid or got tired or somehow thinking about the next thing because there is no next thing,' "" he said in a pre-State of the Union video released on Monday.
But for all the promises of an engaged 2016, there's no getting around the fact that in just one year and eight days, Obama must cede the power to protect what he sees as his greatest achievements, including health care reform, staying out of Middle East quagmires and advancing social justice issues such as gay rights and economic prosperity.
There is no doubt that Obama has an awful lot riding on Clinton capturing the White House -- although he has also met with her left-wing rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the White House said Monday.
A Democratic successor is imperative for Obama because Republicans have vowed to dismantle key aspects of the Obama legacy immediately if they win back the presidential mansion after eight years, including Obamacare, a nuclear deal with Iran, executive actions shielding immigrants and policies designed to slow or reverse climate change.

Though the White House says Obama will not endorse a candidate in the 2016 primary race, there is no doubt that he has long seen Clinton as the best hope for preserving his legacy. 
In fact, that belief was one reason many people in the administration's inner circle were wary of a run by Vice President Joe Biden.
""I think Barack Obama believes that it is incredibly important that Hillary Cinton succeeds him,"" said a former close aide to Obama who is still connected with the White House. ""The only way that we have an economy where people aren't losing their health care is if Hillary Clinton becomes president.""
Jeff Shesol, who is familiar with the dynamic between a president and his preferred successor after working in the final years of the Clinton White House as a speechwriter, including on the State of the Union address, highlighted Obama's reliance on Clinton for his place in history.
""The single most important thing that could happen from here on out for the Obama legacy is the election of Hillary Clinton,"" he said.
On one level, the fact that Obama hopes to entrust his legacy to Clinton is richly ironic. After all, a rejection of the kind of politics of ""division and distraction"" that he hinted that the Clintons helped sow was a strong thematic undercurrent of his 2008 election campaign.
But over the years, after working closely with Clinton when she was his secretary of state and as his prickly relationship with Bill Clinton eased during the former president's important embrace of his 2012 re-election campaign, it's been clear that Obama and his West Wing see the rival he slayed in 2008 as the best bet to safeguard his achievements.
Obama, for instance, was effusive in his praise of his outgoing secretary of state when she left office in 2013. He has continued to meet her for occasional private lunches at the White House and members of his orbit who once decried the Clintons now privately and publicly advocate for her.
For instance, David Plouffe, his one-time political guru who outmaneuvered the Clinton campaign in 2008, wrote in an eye-opening op-ed on Medium in October that she would make an ""outstanding and worthy successor.""

The question for Clinton, as she faces a closer-than-expected race with Sanders and a potentially tight general election, is how much Obama helps her as she seeks to mobilize the Obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 but tries to mitigate the impact of his political failings.
The former secretary of state is touting the administration's record on the economy, with the halving of the unemployment rate and progress on gay rights, health care and climate change -- issues that are important to the Democratic base and the Obama hordes of young, affluent, educated white voters and minorities that she needs to turn out.
She is, meanwhile, vowing to go further than Obama on reforming the immigration system and to be more energetic on preventing gun violence. 
But any downturn in the economy during his last year could render the President's record less impressive and harm her own chances.
Obama's struggles to impose U.S. power in the restive Middle East and elsewhere help fuel a Republican narrative that his foreign policy is a bust, to which she is vulnerable as his first-term secretary of state.
Clinton has already signaled she would go further than Obama in Syria, in tackling ISIS, in mending relations with Israel and in adopting a tougher stance toward Iran, Russia and China than Obama has pursued. The Clinton campaign declined to comment on how Obama's foreign policy legacy will impact Clinton. But aides have previously quarreled with the Republican contention that her time as secretary of state will be a liability.
Clinton has also broken with Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which is opposed by many union leaders and grassroots Democrats. She backed the deal as secretary of state but now says does too little to protect the American worker.
Her move on TPP is one indication of why it is so hard for a candidate of the same party to succeed a two-term president -- a feat so rare that it's only been done once, by George H.W. Bush, since World War II.
Clinton has a firm interest in the incumbent President doing well, but she must also create a campaign in her own right that protects her from his baggage. It was a trick, for example, that Vice President Al Gore failed to pull off as he sought to succeed President Bill Clinton in 2000.
That's one reason Clinton has a clear interest in Obama's State of the Union address heralding a strong 2016 for the President.
Sources who know both Clinton and Obama say that the relationship between the President and Clinton remains friendly and cooperative. That will be tested, however, if Clinton is the nominee and as Obama faces pressure to recede into the background before the fall campaign. Awkwardness is bound to flair between the two camps, especially if Clinton finds herself obliged to begin criticizing aspects of his record for her own political reasons.

""I think there is tension inherently because you have a president who is still president who has certain points that he wants to press and certain directions he wants to lead and he wants his successor to go,"" said Shesol. ""He probably has a good deal of confidence in his political judgment and thinks he knows best.""
He continued, ""There have been very few presidents who just wanted to get the hell out of there. President Obama doesn't want to stop being president. If we didn't have a 22nd Amendment, I am sure he would be running again.""
The requirement for an incumbent president to step back -- a process that begins Tuesday night -- is not an easy one, and it requires him to bite his tongue in some situations when his preferred successor deems it necessary to criticize him.
Democrats to colleagues: Bring Muslims to State of the Union
For instance, in an interview with the Des Moines Editorial Board on Monday, the former New York senator said she would improve on Obama's tortured relationship with Congress.
""I have much more experience doing it. At the end of the day, you have to build those relations and consistently be looking for common ground,"" Clinton said.
But in the case of Obama and Clinton, the tension may be eased by the fact that there is now substantial cross-pollination between the two camps.
Two senior aides to the former first lady -- her communications director Jennifer Palmieri and the campaign's chairman John Podesta -- worked in the White House in recent years, and other lower-level staffers also have a foot in both camps.
And if there are strains in execution, they will pale in comparison with the common goals that Obama and Clinton share -- and which the President will lay out in Tuesday's prime-time address.",13.2,13.0,51.52,0.0,CNN
