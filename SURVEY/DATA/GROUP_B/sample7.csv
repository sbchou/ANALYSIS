12,12,1476,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Gets Some Outside Help He Didn’t Ask For,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/20/bernie-sanders-gets-some-outside-help-he-didnt-ask-for/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.8,7.6,"— America Rising PAC (@AmericaRising) January 19, 2016

With enemies like these, who needs friends?

Senator Bernie Sanders often boasts that he has no “super PAC” supporting his candidacy and he has vigorously tried to keep any from forming. But he has been getting some unsolicited if mischievous help from Republican groups actively promoting the Vermont senator’s surging campaign.

America Rising, a Republican political action committee, reacted with glee on social media on Tuesday to a XXX/WMUR poll that showed Mr. Sanders with a large lead over Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire, sharing the news with “BREAKING” qualifiers and links to news stories.

Karl Rove’s American Crossroads recently created an ad parroting Senator Bernie Sanders’s critiques of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, made repeatedly last week in the days before Sunday’s debate.

And during the debate, Republican groups were blasting out rapid emails defending Mr. Sanders’s positions, including his universal health care plan, an issue many Republicans would embrace as warmly as they would higher taxes.

All of it, of course, is intended to get under Mrs. Clinton’s skin and promote the Democratic candidate they believe would be weaker in a general election. Republican groups and super PACs have spent nearly $5 million targeting Mrs. Clinton so far this cycle. They’ve yet to spend a dollar on advertising attacking Mr. Sanders.

The Clinton campaign released a statement saying this support only furthers their argument that Mrs. Clinton is the candidate the Republicans are most afraid of facing.

“The Sanders argument falls apart when the G.O.P. spokesman is trying to help him and the Republicans run ads trying to stop Hillary Clinton in the primary,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for the Clinton campaign, in a statement. She asserted that Mr. Sanders was “taking his cues” from Mr. Rove, though the senator’s Wall Street attacks predated the Rove ad.

The effort on the right to attack Mrs. Clinton from the left has actually be underway for a while, with groups like American Crossroads and America Rising targeting digital content criticizing Mrs. Clinton’s positions on the Keystone oil pipeline, for example.

“The idea is to make her life difficult in the primary,” Colin Reed, America Rising’s executive director, said last year.",7.6,8.8,57.27,0.0,The New York Times

The new group, called Keep the Promise for Veterans, will be led by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who dropped out of the presidential primary race last fall. Mr. Perry endorsed Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, last month.
The source of the group’s funding has yet to be determined, a spokeswoman said. The family of Texas technology billionaire Darwin Deason has been in talks with Mr. Perry and is considering donating to the group, but doesn’t want to be its sole founder, said Doug Deason, Mr. Deason’s son.
The other four super PACs in the pro-Cruz network — Keep the Promise PAC, Keep the Promise I, Keep the Promise II and Keep the Promise III — are each funded by a different wealthy family, including the fracking billionaires the Wilks brothers and hedge-fund millionaire Robert Mercer. Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, recently flew to Texas to discuss the group with Mr. Perry, who has also met with the leaders of the other super PACs in the network.
At the end of December, the four Keep the Promise groups had about $30 million in the bank. The groups have aired ads on Mr. Cruz’s behalf in early-nominating states including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
“We are excited to welcome Gov. Perry and Keep The Promise for Veterans to help elect Ted Cruz our next president,” said Laura Barnett, a spokeswoman for Keep the Promise PAC. “Gov. Perry’s voice on veterans issues will be a strong asset for Sen. Cruz as the GOP nomination continues to unfold.”
Mr. Perry, an Air Force veteran, will be joined at events by former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell; Taya Kyle, the widow of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle; and Dakota Meyer, a Marine Corps veteran and Medal of Honor winner.",8.0,6.8,73.17,-1.6,The Wall Street Journal
98,98,246,First Draft: Donald Trump Says He’ll Release Tax Returns ‘at Some Point’,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/donald-trump-says-hell-release-tax-returns-at-some-point/,trump,nyt,Campaign Finance,5.6,6.8,"Donald J. Trump said Monday that he would release his tax returns “at some point, probably,” after the radio host Hugh Hewitt pressed Mr. Trump about when he would make them available, warning that delaying in doing so had damaged Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012.  

“When do we get tax returns, Donald Trump, because Mitt Romney got killed on this four years ago,” Mr. Hewitt said in an interview with Mr. Trump, according to a transcript provided by his aides. “”And you’ve got to get them out there as well.” 

“Well, we’ll get them out at some point, probably,”  Mr. Trump said. “I mean, I’m looking at it. I told my people the other day, start looking at it.” 

His returns, he added, “are among the largest. I’m audited all the time by government. And I think every single year, I’ve had an audit for years. And you know, other people, friends of mine say they never get audited. I say congratulations. I have audits every year. So it’s, you know, one of those things. But we are working. They’re very complex papers, but we’re working on it.” 

Mr. Hewitt pressed on, “Will we get them soon, do you think?” 

 “I don’t know,” Mr. Trump replied. “I have to ask my accounting people. But we’ll be working on it. Everything is very much, you know, I gave my financials ahead of schedule, much ahead of schedule. I had a long time to give them, and I gave them immediately. And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.” 

Mr. Romney, who was a private equity executive before he was elected governor of Massachusetts, was savaged by a “super PAC” supporting President Obama, with campaign ads calling him a heartless corporate raider. Mr. Romney did not release his tax returns until the September before the general election that year, when more people were paying attention. They showed he paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent. He had faced months of pressure to release the returns. 

On the eve of Tuesday’s Republican caucuses in Nevada, where he is expected to do well, Mr. Trump also told Mr. Hewitt that he does not like the caucus system, which relies heavily on organizing and is more complex than a primary system. 

“I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it,” said Mr. Trump, who finished second to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Iowa caucuses. “I really don’t believe it’s a good system. You know, I like to have a person walk in, vote and leave, as opposed to walk in, sit around, and who knows what happens. So you know, that’s my preference, but let’s see. I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.” 

In that regard, Mr. Trump has something in common with Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who have criticized the caucus system in the past for similar reasons.",6.8,5.6,76.22,0.0,The New York Times
101,101,116,Donald Trump and the Art of the Mideast Peace Deal,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/22/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-mideast-peace-deal/,trump,wsj,Foreign Policy/National Security,8.4,8.4,"Presidential elections produce stunning bursts of pro-Israel sentiment and support from candidates of both political parties.
This year the fraught relationship between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Iran nuclear deal, and candidates’ desire to be on the right side of the angels on this issue have led to particularly intense pro-Israel rhetoric.
Sen. Marco Rubio routinely uses the biblical terminology Judea and Samaria to refer to the West Bank; Sen. Ted Cruz promises to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to tear up the Iran nuclear agreement if elected president; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before he dropped out of the race on Saturday said he would restore the trust with Israel that the Obama administration had destroyed; and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledges that “with every passing year we must tie the bonds tighter,” and has promised that she would take the U.S.-Israeli relationship to “the next level.”
Amid all this is an outlier: Donald Trump’s rhetoric is decidedly less effusive and his tone much cooler and more detached than his rivals when it comes to Israel and Jewish issues. One might expect Mr. Trump, a New York real estate and business magnate with deep contacts and friendships in the Jewish community, to be noisier and louder on Israel than all the other Republican candidates. He has made positive statements –Ive devoted so much time over my life to Israel,” and The other politicians, they can talk, but believe me, they havent done what Ive done.–but compared to his GOP rivals Mr. Trump has been strikingly low key on this subject.
Mr. Trump was booed at a December meeting of the Republican National Jewish Coalition for not promising, if elected president, that he would move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, though last month he reversed his position. Such pledges are standard fare for Republicans and even some Democrats, but Mr. Trump initially dodged the question.
In a December interview, Mr. Trump wondered aloud whether Israels and Palestinians want to make peace.
A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal–whether or not Israels willing to sacrifice certain things, he said.
Instead of blasting the Palestinians in ways that have become routine political talking points, Mr. Trump demonstrated a kind of negotiators detachment. And in contrast to other GOP candidates, Mr. Trump described Israeli housing projects–presumably he meant settlements in the West Bank–as a huge sticking point in negotiating any deal.
During last week’s XXX town hall meeting in South Carolina, Mr. Trump declined to say whether Israelis or Palestinians were to blame for the violent clashes. If I win, I dont want to be in a position where Im saying to you, and the other side now says, We dont want Trump involved, we dont want… Let me be sort of a neutral guy, lets see whatIm going to give it a shot. It would be so great.
What explains Mr. Trumps coolness in a campaign where hotly touting pro-Israel credentials is par for the course? Is it his self-confidence? He told the Republican Jewish Coalition, “you’re going to love where I am on Israel.”
Is he such a self-financed maverick that he doesnt care about Republican Jewish support and has no intention of pandering? Youre not going to support me,” he told a gathering of Republican Jews, even though Ill be the best guy for Israel.”
Or could the driving factor be that Mr. Trump would love to try to make a deal between Israel and the Palestinians? He has expressed his interest and enthusiasm for this several times. Striking a deal “would be a really great achievement,” because theres been “so much death, so much turmoil, so much hatred.”
He told the XXX that getting a deal to end the prolonged conflict is “something I’d really like to do.” Is it possible that to preserve his credibility as a mediator, Mr. Trump purposefully avoids adopting positions that might prejudice success in a future negotiation?
Mr. Trumps posture on Israel represents an intriguing bit of unpredictability on a politically sensitive issue about which most of his rivals are quite predictable. It’s fascinating that on almost every issue, he is brash and bold, yet on such a diplomatically sensitive issue as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he is circumspect and careful. Mr. Trump frequently cites his consummate skill as a negotiator.
Could it be that the author of “The Art of the Deal” believes he can achieve what no U.S. president or secretary of state has accomplished — brokering an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians?",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The Wall Street Journal
114,114,902,Trump unscathed in GOP ad wars,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/politics/primary-conflicts-2016/index.html,trump,cnn,Campaign Finance,12.3,12.4,"Washington (XXX) With just a month to go before the first votes for president are cast in Iowa and New Hampshire, TV audiences are being treated to an onslaught of 30-second attack ads as candidates smear each other with the help of ominous narrators, grainy footage and foreboding music.
Yet Donald Trump, the party's undisputed front-runner for six months, remains the only candidate unscathed so far.
Here's a look at some of the most recent spots.

Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have been tussling for months, first over each other's immigration stances and now over national security. 
RELATED: As negative ads pile up in Iowa, Ted Cruz plots a bigger footprint
On Monday, the super PAC backing Cruz released a new spot to paint Rubio, who has been dogged by questions about his Senate attendance record, as unserious. Using footage from a lighthearted video Rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against America before cutting to video of Rubio discussing fantasy football. The ad is set to run in Iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by Rubio ahead of the caucuses.
Rubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security.

And a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, released an ad Tuesday touting Rubio's electability that calls him ""the one Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against,"" an attempt to tweak Cruz over concerns about his general election viability due to his hardline conservatism. 

Cruz isn't the only candidate with whom Rubio is locking horns.
This week, the Florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, just as the brash governor is threatening Rubio's status as the GOP establishment's preferred candidate.
Rubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions, put up two ads in New Hampshire, blasting Christie over his record in New Jersey. The first calls Christie ""Obama's favorite Republican governor"" and criticizes his support for an Internet sales tax, the Common Core education initiative and 'liberal"" energy policies. 
The second ad slams Christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: ""High taxes. Weak Economy. Scandals.""
Christie's team is hitting back. In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for ""someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out."" The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform. 

Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are hoping that strong showings in Iowa -- where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively -- will help sustain their campaigns. 
And as they woo social conservatives and evangelicals in the Hawkeye State, they're taking aim at Cruz.
An ad from Santorum's campaign this week seeks to do this by contrasting the former Pennsylvania senator's tenure with Cruz's. A narrator recounts Santorum's achievements before cutting to video of Cruz reading ""Green Eggs and Ham"" during his 2013 filibuster over Obamacare.
Huckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super PAC, Pursuing America's Greatness, releasing an ad titled ""Two Teds."" The attack attempts to paint Cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of Cruz at a New York City fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration.
The two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa -- and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.

Meanwhile, Trump, who overwhelmingly leads the rest of the GOP field according to a XXX/ORC poll released late last month, has received his share of flak from other candidates and the groups supporting them, even if they've failed to dent his seemingly impenetrable poll numbers. 
The Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. In November, the group released a spot effectively comparing Trump to Hitler and the Nazis, and the PAC is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in New Hampshire.
Meanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul ""reckless"" and ""impulsive"" in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he ""wasted"" $40 million.
Trump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.",12.4,12.3,53.55,0.0,CNN
