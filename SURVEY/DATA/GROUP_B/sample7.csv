7,7,1481,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Tells Minnesotans They Can ‘Make History’,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-tells-minnesotans-they-can-make-history/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"MINNEAPOLIS — On the eve of voting in 11 Democratic contests, Bernie Sanders told hundreds of supporters here on Monday that he was counting on them to defeat Hillary Clinton and start a political revolution.

Mr. Sanders, eager to bounce back from back-to-back losses in Nevada and South Carolina, cast the primaries and caucuses on Tuesday as a chance to “make history” and show that the coalition of young and working-class people he hopes to bring together can help him win the Democratic presidential nomination. The senator also criticized Mrs. Clinton on several fronts: her praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, her ties to Wall Street and her stances on trade policies.

“The truth is, tomorrow is important and key,” Mr. Sanders said, adding, as usual, that a high voter turnout would benefit him. “We can win, no question, here in Minnesota — if we have the turnout.”

Mr. Sanders also said it was important that voters understood the differences between him and Mrs. Clinton. He stressed that he did not have a “super PAC” as she does and that Mrs. Clinton supported several trade policies that he believes led to millions of people losing their jobs. He also chastised her admiration for Mr. Kissinger.

“She looked to Henry Kissinger as one of her mentors,” Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd booed. “I will not look to Henry Kissinger for guidance. In fact, Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.”

Mr. Sanders, delivering a stump speech for about 40 minutes, also said that if elected he would change campaign finance laws, devote resources to fighting climate change and work on combating institutional racism. He added that he would push back against laws that in his view suppress voter rights. And he pledged to increase wages and give people access to tuition-free public colleges and universities.

The senator also talked about providing more resources to American Indians. “We owe Native Americans so, so much,” Mr. Sanders said. “We cannot continue current policies which are so devastating to the Native-American community. That will change under a Sanders administration.”

His address came after his campaign announced that the senator had raised $36 million  from 1.2 million individual donors in February. The campaign added that they hoped to raise $40 million by the end of Monday — meaning that they are aiming to bring in $4 million in one day.

Mr. Sanders also planned to hold a rally in Milton, Mass., on Monday night, the same state where Hillary Clinton campaigned on Monday.",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders
37,37,1775,Cuomo: New Yorkers Not ‘Judgmental’ Like Cruz,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/15/cuomo-new-yorkers-not-judgmental-like-cruz/,cruz,wsj,Abortion,6.0,7.2,"Sen. Ted Cruz’s attack on “ New York values” has attracted the ire of a prominent New Yorker: Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
In three TV interviews on Friday, the morning after the most recent GOP presidential debate, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, excoriated Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, for his comments the previous evening.
“We’re not judgmental, negative and hostile, the way Cruz was,” Mr. Cuomo told NY1. “In one, 30-second sound-bite, he was offensive to gays, he was offensive to women, he offended 18 million New Yorkers — one of the largest Congressional delegations, by the way, in the country.”
A Cruz spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Cruz has criticized Donald Trump for embodying  “New York values.” During the debate, he was asked about what he meant by that. He said: “Everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.”
“I guess I can frame it another way,” he added: “Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying.”
Mr. Trump responded by noting conservative giant William F. Buckley was a New Yorker and cited the resilience of New Yorkers following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
In the NY1 interview, Mr. Cuomo, along with describing Mr. Cruz’s remarks as designed to “spread fear,” said they were inaccurate: “We have a significant conservative party and movement in New York. About 30% of New Yorkers will tell you they are conservatives. Trust me,” he said, “I deal with them every day.”
Mr. Cuomo also pegged Mr. Cruz as a hypocrite for having fundraised in New York, which the senator has done on numerous occasions. “I’m sure Ted Cruz was very negative about New York money,” the governor said, mockingly. “I’m sure he’s not going to accept any money from any New Yorker. I’m sure if he has, he’s going to return all of those contributions.”
Added Mr. Cuomo: “I’m always open to give him an education on what New York values are all about. And if he had any class, he would apologize to the people of New York — not that I believe they need it, or they want it. But if he had any class, he would apologize.”
Aside from NY1, Mr. Cuomo also appeared on XXX and XXX.
The governor wasn’t the only New York official to pounce on Mr. Cruz. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that he was “disgusted” by the senator’s remarks.
Said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat: “I find myself, for once, in agreement with Donald Trump. I think it was right for Donald Trump to defend New York City, and to talk about the heroic actions of the people of this city after 9/11.”",6.8,5.6,76.22,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal,Ted Cruz

Venue: Dordt College, in a cavernous student activity center

Mood: Zealous pre-semester orientation

Travel opportunities (per signage): three-week program in Puerto Rico. Contact Professor Rikki Heldt.

Subjects of questions for Mr. Cruz from attendees: undocumented immigrants; his opposition to subsidies supported by the ethanol industry; whether China or Russia poses a greater threat

Highlight: Mr. Cruz almost certainly became the first presidential candidate to say, “I’m going to stick with Fonzie jumping the shark.” In his first somewhat fractious news conference this trip, Mr. Cruz repeatedly declined to address Donald J. Trump’s comments questioning the senator’s eligibility to be president. (Mr. Cruz was born in Canada.) His most substantive reply on Tuesday was, indeed, a tweet with a shark-jumping video clip from the show “Happy Days.” Mr. Cruz said he would let that stand.",6.8,6.8,67.76,0.0,The New York Times,Ted Cruz
46,46,2014,Ted Cruz worry: Big South Carolina loss equals bad Super Tuesday,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/19/politics/ted-cruz-south-carolina-super-tuesday/index.html,cruz,cnn,Abortion,9.1,10.4,"(XXX) What if the firewall crumbles?
That's the worry of a growing number of people close to Ted Cruz's campaign, who are privately beginning to fear that a big loss in South Carolina to Donald Trump on Saturday could signal more defeats to come in the so-called SEC states that are the lynchpin of Cruz's strategy. 
""If they're pretty far back from Trump and they can't get southern conservative evangelicals in South Carolina, I do think they're probably going to have a hard time elsewhere,"" said Erick Erickson, a conservative writer in touch with Cruz's team. ""I sense a real fear from people that if Trump blows everybody out of the water in South Carolina, that he is suddenly unstoppable."" 
Cruz's team once envisioned South Carolina as a rubber match between Trump, the New Hampshire victor, and Cruz, the Iowa winner. Now, it's being read as an omen of what's to come in 10 days' time when Southern states vote on Super Tuesday.
Cruz once called the God-fearing, gun-toting SEC states that vote then on March 1 his ""firewall,"" but polls show Trump leading in South Carolina, and a dominant performance Saturday would show that Cruz has not been able to sufficiently consolidate the evangelical base that he needs to win down the road in places like Tennessee and Georgia.
The recent XXX Poll of Polls shows Trump with an average lead of 16 percentage points over Cruz, though a new NBC News/XXX/Marist survey on Friday showed Cruz only 5 points back.
Several people close to the campaign concede that losing South Carolina by double digits would spell serious trouble for Super Tuesday. If it's a tighter loss, some say, it would validate the theory that Trump was susceptible to their attacks and encourage more.
""Everybody is watching: Can support be stripped from Donald Trump?"" one pro-Cruz fundraiser asked, predicting that if Trump only earns between 25% and 30%, it will ""unleash"" a new wave of anti-Trump money. ""Then people will realize Trump can be beaten in a lot of the March 1 states."" 
""But if Trump gets 38 or 40 -- and Cruz is second with 22 or something like that -- it's going to be very ominous,"" the fundraiser added.
All week, Cruz has campaigned with the same urgency seen in the lead-up to Iowa, gleefully drawing sharp contrasts with Trump and Rubio alike. He has rolled out his best endorsements, including one from Rep. Mark Sanford on Friday. And he has showed an awareness of the high stakes on Saturday for his campaign, where the narrative could begin to swing against him in the South.
""Twenty-one hours. That's how long we've got until the polls close,"" Cruz said in Myrtle Beach. ""These next 21 hours are going to decide a great deal.""

Cruz allies are doing everything they can to separate their candidate's fortunes in South Carolina from those elsewhere in the South. 
The campaign points to a national XXX survey this week that showed Cruz leading Trump by 2 points, although other national polls still have the New York businessman easily in the lead. They also maintain that Trump's position on abortion and his recent comments about the presidency of George W. Bush will doom him in the South. 
""It's a little tough to do an exact extrapolation between what happened in South Carolina and on March 1,"" said Jason Miller, a senior Cruz adviser, who stressed that Cruz has already proven in Iowa that it can turn out his voters. ""These are states that Ted Cruz matches up well in."" 
Cruz surrogate Jack Kingston, a former congressman from just over the border in Georgia, went so far as to tell reporters Thursday that Cruz ""shouldn't even be viable"" in South Carolina, quite the departure from a state that Cruz's team once saw as winnable. 
Glenn Beck: God took Scalia to give America Ted Cruz as president
It is hard to overstate the importance of March 1 to Cruz's self-professed path to victory -- he has made the date, which will award more delegates than any other day in the Republican calendar, the cornerstone of his strategy. 
Allies tell XXX Cruz is hoping to win 60% of the delegates there. He scrapped time in Iowa to take two barnstorming bus tours of the south. He's called his operation three to five times better than the rest of the field's. And the core of Cruz's SEC stronghold, his home state of Texas, is still unlikely to be pierced.

The Cruz campaign appears as occupied with Marco Rubio leapfrogging them into third place as it is with catching Trump for first. It releases anti-Rubio attack ads at a daily rate and has jumped squarely into a messy, seemingly endless argument with Rubio's over Facebook pages and Photoshopped images.
Miller and Cruz aides are trying to hoist Rubio's expectations as high as possible: Given Rubio's endorsements here, including Gov. Nikki Haley, Cruz's team argues Rubio needs to outright win the state in order to meet them.
As for Trump, the plan is simple: attack.
With the race shifting to a national campaign defined more by expensive television ads than retail politics, some Cruz supporters have faith that South Carolina will show that negative ads like those Cruz forces have aired against Trump will work. After largely skating free in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump is finally being attacked by a battery of super PACs. 
Cruz's campaign is hitting Trump on those issues, airing ads featuring Trump's 1999 interview with the late Tim Russert in which he declares he is ""pro-choice."" (Trump maintains his position has changed and sent Cruz a cease-and-desist letter, which Cruz laughed off.) 
Ted Cruz to Donald Trump: Sue me
Assuming Cruz does hold off Rubio, though, the key will be how large the margin of loss is to Trump, who also holds a large lead in Nevada. 
""If Trump wins and we're second, the SEC primary becomes a 50/50 scenario,"" said one Cruz insider. ""It's our territory, but he'll have the momentum."" 
In the meantime, Cruz is trying his best to look ahead. When a foreign-born woman who now lives in Georgia crossed the Carolina border to see Cruz in Greenville on Thursday, Cruz was as eager to get her to the ballot box as she was herself. 
""The reason I became an American citizen is so I can vote for people like you,"" Hannah Kanner, born in communist Czechoslovakia, told him. ""I'm from Georgia -- sorry! I wish I could vote on Saturday, but I can't."" 
""On March 1,"" Cruz replied, ""you can.""",10.4,9.1,67.08,0.0,CNN,Ted Cruz
112,112,156,Donald Trump just plain wrong on torture (opinion),http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/opinions/trump-torture-bergenas/index.html,trump,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,11.9,9.6,"Johan Bergenas is a senior associate at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, a nonprofit institution devoted to enhancing international peace and security through analysis and outreach. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.
 (XXX) Donald Trump says that ""torture works"" and that if elected president, he will bring back waterboarding.
In fact, he says he will allow techniques ""a hell of a lot worse"" than waterboarding and use them regardless of effectiveness on terrorist organizations like ISIS because they ""deserve it."" 
By advocating that the United States brings back torture, Trump again demonstrates his astute understanding of the American electorate. Fifty-three percent of Americans say that torturing terrorists can be justified. Polling only Republicans, the slice of the electorate Trump is trying to charm in this primary season, the number is even larger, over 70%.
One reason behind these large numbers can be gathered from psychological studies in which individuals support the use of torture when the subject is categorized as a terrorist, regardless of its intelligence value.
It may be smart politics to support torture, but Trump's eye-for-an-eye approach to defeat terrorist networks will make the United States less, not more, safe and the American electorate needs to know why, before more ballots are cast.
In fact, today most government officials, regardless of party affiliation, experts and scientists agree with Republican Sen. John McCain that torture ""compromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good.""
Importantly, there is also widespread agreement that American use of torture serves as a recruitment magnet for the world's terrorist networks. Several high ranking government officials note how al Qaeda use Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay as symbolic recruiting tools to reinforce anti-American sentiment and grow their numbers.
In short, Trump's torture policy will fuel the same terrorist organizations that he wants to destroy.
In 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order banning waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques -- the methods Trump says he would reinstall if elected. Instead Obama favors methods that glean intelligence without sacrificing America's ideals, such as a rapport-building approach that is far more likely to elicit good and earlier intelligence than torture. 
When issuing the executive order, the President said that enhanced interrogation methods ""serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists and they increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. ... They did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them.""
Trump is not alone in wanting to bring back torture to the U.S. foreign policy toolkit. Though perhaps not as vocal, other Republican candidates consider a return to the use of torture if elected. Marco Rubio defends the Bush administration's authorization of torture, while Ted Cruz claims that waterboarding doesn't qualify as torture.
The United States has a dark recent past on torture and loose talk by Republicans -- particularly Trump as the party's frontrunner -- on torture damages the country's ability to repair its reputation abroad. More importantly, there are direct links between torture and making America less safe. The policy and talk thereof should hence be returned to the abyss that it was buried in by President Obama over seven years ago.
