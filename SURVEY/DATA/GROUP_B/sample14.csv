31,31,1686,XXX/WMUR Poll: Cruz climbs in NH,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/new-hampshire-poll-trump-leads-cruz-climbs/index.html,cruz,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,4.8,7.2,"Washington (XXX) Donald Trump holds a 20-point lead in the New Hampshire Republican primary, a new XXX/WMUR poll shows. 
Behind him, there's still a scrum for second place -- with support for No. 2, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, on the rise.
Trump is backed by 34% of those likely to vote in New Hampshire's February 9 GOP primary, more than double his nearest contender, Cruz, who has 14% support. 
 
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are tied for third with 10% each. 
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul are each tied at 6%, followed by Carly Fiorina with 4% support, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 1%.  
But the poll's results suggest there's volatility: Just 31% of the Republicans surveyed say they've made up their minds about who they'll support.
Cruz is the candidate who has grown the most since a December poll: He's climbed from 6% to 14%, largely on the strength of a favorability rating that has jumped from 46% in December to 55% now. 
Trump, though, dominates on the two issues that likely voters have identified as most important: the economy and the threat of ISIS. 
Nearly half -- 48% -- of Republicans say Trump would best handle the economy, far ahead of Bush, Cruz and Kasich, with just 7% each. And 32% say he'd best handle ISIS, ahead of Cruz's 14%, Bush's 12% and Rubio's 10%. 
The poll carries both good and bad news for Bush: He's cracked double-digit support for the first time since last summer. But he is viewed unfavorably by 51% of the state's Republican voters, with 40% viewing him favorably. 
The survey of 413 likely New Hampshire Republican primary voters was conducted January 13-18 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Its margin of error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",7.2,4.8,83.66,0.0,CNN,Ted Cruz
33,33,1827,First Draft: Ted Cruz to Begin 6-Day Bus Tour to Help Him Secure Lead in Iowa,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/04/ted-cruz-to-begin-6-day-bus-tour-to-help-him-hold-onto-lead-in-iowa/,cruz,nyt,Immigration,5.2,6.4,"For weeks, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been perched atop the Iowa polls despite a conspicuous omission from his campaign calendar: appearances in Iowa.

On Monday, Mr. Cruz returns to the state for the first time in about a month. The trip will not be subtle.

He is setting off on a six-day, 28-town bus tour intended to cement his status as the state’s front-runner. The campaign, prone to frequently using puns, has labeled the trip as the “Cruzin’ to Caucus” tour.

The visit comes after a week in which two rivals, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, sought to capitalize on Mr. Cruz’s absence from the state with appearances of their own. Mr. Cruz is also facing increasingly aggressive attacks from his competitors, including the campaigns or allies of Mr. Rubio, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Huckabee.

Even Donald J. Trump, who has largely resisted jabs at Mr. Cruz, is showing signs of frustration. In an apparent knock on Mr. Cruz’s faith, Mr. Trump has repeatedly said, vaguely but ominously, that not many evangelicals come from Cuba.",6.4,5.2,77.23,0.0,The New York Times,Ted Cruz
34,34,1952,Ted Cruz: 2016 Is a ‘Referendum’ on the Supreme Court,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/15/ted-cruz-2016-is-a-referendum-on-the-supreme-court/,cruz,wsj,Abortion,6.0,7.2,"AIKEN, S.C.In the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is stepping up his campaign-trail focus on what impact the 2016 election could have on the Supreme Court.
He warned the addition of a liberal justice to the bench threatens to turn federal judicial policy sharply to the left on issues ranging from gun rights to abortion.
I intend to make 2016 a referendum on the Supreme Court, Mr. Cruz said in a rally at Aiken, S.C., his first campaign event since Mr. Scalias death Saturday. Adding to the litany of actions he would take on his first day as president, Mr. Cruz said, I will have no more solemn responsibility than to name a replacement for Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.
Providing a glimpse of how the impending court battle may be reshaping the focus of the 2016 primary fight, Mr. Cruz also used the issue to give conservatives a new reason to vote against his rival, GOP frontrunner Donald J. Trump.
Donald Trump, if he were president, would appoint liberals to the court, Mr. Cruz said to reporters before the rally. Donald has been liberal his entire adult life, he said, citing Mr. Trump’s support for abortion rights, among other issues.
Mr. Trump pushed back Monday, releasing a statement calling Mr. Cruz’s comments “totally untrue and completely outrageous.”
“I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William ‘Bill’ Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes,” Mr. Trump said.
He called himself “staunchly pro-life” and “one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms.”
Some of Mr. Cruzs supporters in the audience said they shared his concern about the future of the court, and were also unsure what kind of justices Mr. Trump would choose if he were president.
I dont know what he is going to do. Hes all over the place, said David Howell, 60, a retired software engineer from Lexington, S.C. Im wondering if he is some kind of Manchurian candidate.",7.2,6.0,75.2,0.0,The Wall Street Journal,Ted Cruz
49,49,1802,"First Draft: Group Backing Ted Cruz Makes $573,000 Ad Buy in Nevada",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/15/group-backing-ted-cruz-makes-573000-ad-buy-in-nevada/,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,9.1,9.2,"The most prominent “super PAC” supporting Ted Cruz said on Monday that it was placing a $573,000 ad buy in Nevada and boosting its field operations in the state.

The move by the group, Keep the Promise I, comes a week before the Nevada caucuses on the Republican side — a key test for Mr. Cruz and his allies, who are hoping to capitalize on Donald J. Trump’s perceived weakness in ground organization.

A spokeswoman said the group had 13 paid staff members and about 75 canvassers in the state.

While Mr. Trump has significant holdings and impeccable name recognition in Nevada, his loss in Iowa, another caucus state, has left questions about his capacity to efficiently turn out voters in states where organization matters more than advertising. 

Mr. Cruz’s campaign and super PAC network have invested heavily on the ground in states across the primary calendar.

Keep the Promise I said it was hiring Nathan Emens, a local operative, to oversee its Nevada ground game. The group also plans to distribute 100,000 mail pieces in the state this week highlighting Marco Rubio’s “less than conservative record on immigration, cap-and-trade, military spending and Libya.”

“You are only as good as the company you keep…” the mailer reads, with Mr. Rubio, a senator from Florida, pictured beside images of Hillary Clinton and Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Harry Reid of Nevada.

The two television spots in the ad buy are mostly positive, focusing on Mr. Cruz, though one does feature an ominous photo of Mr. Rubio as Mr. Cruz is heard saying, “Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats but to leaders in our own party?”",9.2,9.1,61.67,0.0,The New York Times,Ted Cruz
