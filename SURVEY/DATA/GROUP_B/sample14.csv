Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, stopped for lunch Friday afternoon at Keys Cafe in St. Paul before a pair of events in a state whose caucuses are March 1.

You want the scoop? Mr. Sanders said, turning to the news media entourage that now routinely trails him as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination. “The scoop is tuna salad and rye with lettuce and tomato.
There’s more.
Jane Sanders ordered a grilled cheese sandwich on white, and Mr. Sanders also had a bowl of turkey wild rice soup.
When the Sanderses and their Secret Service detail entered the restaurant, one employee gaped and said: Are you kidding me? Bernie Sanders?
Yes, Bernie Sanders.
The owner, Carol Hunn-Gregory, sat at the booth and briefly chatted with the couple while photographers captured the moment.
I told him I appreciated him stopping and that were remodeling and I was sorry about the mess, she said later.
So, has Ms. Hunn-Gregory made up her mind whom to support? It was Hillary, but Ive kind of been on the fence, she said. Bernie has a lot of good issues dealing with health care. I like the single-payer system.",6.4,5.2,77.23,-0.8,The Wall Street Journal

More than $6 million of that money was raised on Monday, the last day of the month, when the campaign issued a push for donations with the goal of bringing February’s total to $40 million. The funds raised in February came from 1.4 million individual contributors who donated an average of $30 each, according to the campaign, which drew a contrast with what it called the wealthier donors supporting Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.

“Working Americans chipping in a few dollars every week are changing the way campaigns in our country are financed,” Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said in a statement issued after midnight. “Not only are we going to smash Secretary Clinton’s personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination.”

Mr. Weaver added that Mr. Sanders’s supporters are “a firewall protecting Bernie from the Clinton campaign’s wealthiest donors and super PACs.”",9.6,9.5,60.65,0.0,The New York Times
36,36,1821,First Draft: Ted Cruz’s Iowa Bus Tour: The Tattooed Hunk Had a Familiar Face,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/09/ted-cruzs-iowa-bus-tour-the-tattooed-hunk-had-a-familiar-face/,cruz,nyt,Immigration,6.0,7.2,"Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour.

EVENT 26:

Time: 2:27 p.m., Jan. 9

Place: Oelwein, Iowa (population: 6,415)

Site: Luigi’s Restaurant, with a model cannon, a disco ball and a giant painting of a possibly Italian coastline

Mood: Amore, with Cruz lawn signs

Food: Uncle Dominic’s Italian Beef Dinner, Luigi’s Tour of Italy, Steak Vesuvius

Tough love: Mr. Cruz, whose older daughter, Caroline, is the frequent subject of gentle stump speech teasing, had begun an anecdote about the 7-year-old when a baby began crying. “She makes us do that a lot,” Mr. Cruz said.

Highlight: “Would it kill Republicans to crack a joke?” Mr. Cruz asked, describing how the party could better appeal to young voters. “Actually, I think some of them, it might.”

Mr. Cruz has had so such qualms this trip.

He recalled for the crowd a series of posters, unaffiliated with his campaign, that had appeared in Los Angeles. They depicted the candidate shirtless (with eight-pack abs), heavily tattooed and smoking a cigarette. “I noticed a glaring error,” Mr. Cruz said, echoing his campaign’s response at the time. “I don’t smoke cigarettes.”

88,88,1317,"TOO MUCH SHARING AT STATE? New video suggests Clinton, aides used BlackBerries for sensitive info",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/26/video-suggests-clinton-shared-info-that-would-never-be-on-unclassified-system-normally.html,clinton,fox,Foreign Policy/National Security,13.4,11.2,"A 2013 video, obtained exclusively by XXX News, raises fresh questions about how Hillary Clinton handled sensitive information at the State Department. 
In the video, veteran diplomat Wendy Sherman reveals that in the interest of speed, Clinton and her aides would share information that ""would never be on an unclassified system"" normally. 
The questions surround a 2013 speech in which Sherman compared the technology differences between serving at the State Department in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Obama. 
""Now we have BlackBerries, and it has changed the way diplomacy is done,"" Sherman, who was undersecretary of state at the time, said in the 2013 on-camera remarks. ""Things appear on your BlackBerries that would never be on an unclassified system. But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.""
Clinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. 
The Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. 
In Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. 
The secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. 
""So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,"" said Sherman. ""To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.""
The Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.
Previous email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. 
The State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. 
The conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves ""foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,"" so it was born classified when the emails were created. 
""Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,"" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. ""This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.""
A Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new XXX News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. 
The polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important.

111,111,259,First Draft: Hispanic Celebrities Denounce Donald Trump and G.O.P. Field,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/11/hispanic-celebrities-denounce-donald-trump-and-g-o-p-field/,trump,nyt,Immigration,11.5,9.2,"A group of Hispanic celebrities have signed an open letter denouncing Donald J. Trump and many of the Republican presidential candidates for “capitalizing on negative stereotypes” about Latinos  to galvanize the party’s base. 

The letter, put together by the People for the American Way and signed by celebrities including the actors Benjamin Bratt, America Ferrera and Zoe Saldana and the musician Carlos Santana, is one of the strongest denunciations to date by high-profile Hispanic figures of the current tone of the presidential race. 

“In trying to win the nomination, every one of the leading candidates dug themselves into a deep hole pandering to the anti-immigrant base of the Republican Party that idolizes Donald Trump,” the letter says. 

“There’s no coming back from this. We’ve seen clearly that all the leading Republican candidates have sided with the far-right at the expense of the Latino community,” the letter says. “They’re capitalizing on negative stereotypes and inaccurate information” for political gain.  

The writers seek to prevent other Republicans from hiding their anti-immigration positions. Democrats consider Hispanic voters to be a key part of what they see as an emerging national coalition, as the party’s support from white voters has shrunk. 

“This downward spiral began with Trump,” the letter says, adding, “We must not, though, let Trump’s xenophobia overshadow the extreme policies being pushed by every single one of the G.O.P.’s leading presidential candidates.”

“Trump is certainly an outlier for his racist remarks. But the rest of the Republican presidential candidates went off the deep end with him,” the letter says, also condemning the language of Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. 

A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. ",9.2,11.5,44.75,0.0,The New York Times
