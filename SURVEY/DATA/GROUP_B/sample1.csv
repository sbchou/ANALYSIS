11,11,1392,Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/,sanders,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.8,7.6,"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.
At the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.
They were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long. It was an enthusiastic show of support for the Vermont senator, and also an obnoxious, ear-drum piercing pounding.
They blared their horns whenever Mr. Sanderss name was mentioned, and many times when it wasnt. The horns even blared throughout a Sanders campaign video introducing the candidate, rendering it impossible from some 2,200 people assembled to hear many of the words.
Veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston unleashed a Twitter  storm of some two dozen tweets complaining about the noise.
If Bernie can’t shush the vuvuzelas, how can he stand up to Putin? he wrote in one. Bernie says he has no SuperPAC. But he has a super-obnoxious horn section, he said in another.
Even Mr. Sanders commented on the cacophony when he finally took the stage. That music is really beautiful, he said sarcastically.",7.6,8.8,57.27,0.0,The Wall Street Journal
40,40,1998,Ted Cruz Starts to Crack G.O.P. Establishment’s Wall of Opposition,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/us/politics/ted-cruz-starts-to-crack-gop-establishments-wall-of-opposition.html,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"NEW ORLEANS — Striding up the sidewalk of one of this city’s most affluent neighborhoods on Monday evening, S. Scott Sewell seemed an unlikely figure to be attending a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz. An oil industry executive, Mr. Sewell served in President George Bush’s administration, lent a hand to George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential recount, and was twice a chairman for Mitt Romney’s Louisiana campaigns.

But if such a creature of the Republican establishment appeared an odd fit to support a candidate whose political identity was shaped challenging his party’s leadership, the candlelit, art-filled setting for Mr. Cruz’s reception was even more surprising: the elegant home of the longtime Bush loyalist Mary Matalin and her husband, James Carville, the Democratic strategist.

The vast majority of Republican elites remain bitterly opposed to the prospect of Mr. Cruz’s becoming the party’s presidential nominee, some even preferring to take their chances with Donald J. Trump. Yet, to the strains of a jazz trio a block from St. Charles Avenue here, over Texas barbecue at his Houston campaign office and in one of Washington’s see-and-be-seen steakhouses, Mr. Cruz, Washington’s chief anti-establishment agitator, has quietly begun wooing some of the party’s most entrenched donors and officials.

“We’re working hard to consolidate a lot of support,” Mr. Cruz told a reporter as he mingled with guests arriving at Ms. Matalin’s home.

Some in the old guard have started signaling to their reluctant right-of-center brethren that it is time to face the possibility that the hard-line Mr. Cruz could be their standard-bearer.

“If Cruz makes it, which is very doable, every one of the establishment crowd who is now eviscerating him will line up, salute smartly and get on board,” Ms. Matalin said, offering a mix of prodding and prophecy. “No one will want to be responsible for a G.O.P. defeat.”

That even traces of détente have appeared between Mr. Cruz and the party’s traditional power brokers this early illustrates how thoroughly unpredictable the Republican race has been — and that, for major political donors, it can be safer to hedge one’s bets in such a volatile environment.

But others in the party hierarchy, including the officially neutral Ms. Matalin, either share some of the frustrations that have propelled Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump or at least recognize what the two have tapped into.

They also take him at his word. “I believe in Senator Cruz because he believes what he’s saying,” Mr. Sewell said outside the Matalin-Carville home, echoing sentiments often heard among the rank-and-file at Mr. Cruz’s Iowa gatherings.

What is more striking, and will cause deep consternation among Republican strategists, is that other donors are beginning to embrace Mr. Cruz’s argument that he can win a general election by motivating core conservatives to come to the polls rather than by appealing to swing voters.

Andrew Puzder, chief executive of the conglomerate that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., supported both of Mr. Romney’s campaigns and has contributed to a number of “super PACs” and candidates this year, including Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But after spending a couple of hours eating brisket with Mr. Cruz on Sunday at his campaign headquarters, Mr. Puzder said he was “very seriously considering” getting behind him, in part because of his appeal to the conservative base.

“I’ve become a one-issue voter,” Mr. Puzder said. “My one issue is whether somebody is going to win. My big question is: What is your path to a general election victory?”

Unhappily recalling that Mr. Romney won among self-described independents but still was soundly defeated by President Obama, Mr. Puzder said, “Part of the reason was that the base didn’t turn out to vote, and Senator Cruz understands that needs to happen.”

The theory of the missing conservative voter, central to Mr. Cruz’s pitch, has been widely and robustly challenged, including by figures on the right. But it is taking flight among some in the party’s donor class.

“The reason Republicans lost in 2012 and 2008 is not because we lost swing voters,” Carla Sands, a California investor, wrote in an invitation to a $1,000-a-plate Los Angeles luncheon this week featuring Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi. “The reason Republicans lost is because they failed to motivate and turn out their base — mainly evangelical voters in states like Florida, Colorado and Pennsylvania who didn’t feel that the Republican nominee spoke to their issues.”

Ms. Sands, a philanthropist who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to establishment-aligned Republicans, predicted that “this election will also be a ‘base’ election, and we need a candidate who inspires and excites the base of our party to come out and vote.”

Mr. Cruz’s wife, who met him on the 2000 Bush campaign and worked in the administration, has emerged as something of a liaison to right-of-center donors. She headlined events in Atlanta; Austin, Dallas, Houston and Midland, Tex.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Seattle in November and December, helping Mr. Cruz raise nearly $20 million in the final quarter of the year — a haul expected to exceed those of any of the more establishment-friendly candidates.

But Mr. Cruz has other links to the party elites he has long railed against: Mr. Puzder was connected to him by Anthony R. Dolan, Ronald Reagan’s chief speechwriter, who is now part of Mr. Cruz’s team of advisers. Chad Sweet, Mr. Cruz’s campaign chairman, worked at Goldman Sachs and was chief of staff to Michael Chertoff, a Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush.

Mr. Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, has also cultivated relationships with the relatively small universe of Republican strategists. In December, he telephoned the lobbyist Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns, about arranging a get-acquainted meeting with him for Mr. Cruz when Congress returns this month (the meeting has not come about).

Mr. Cruz will, though, appear at a pair of fund-raisers in the Washington area next week that may lure some party regulars: a $1,000 per-person “happy hour” at the Capital Grille, followed by an event at the McLean, Va., home of Michael Adams, a former Bechtel Group executive.

Not all of Mr. Cruz’s wooing has led to a love connection. Former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, who describes himself as “a RINO” — a Republican in name only — rode from the airport to a fund-raiser with Mr. Cruz when the Texas senator visited California last month.

“He’s doing extremely well, which surprises me because I don’t think he’s as warm a personality as others,” Mr. Riordan said. “But he’s a very strong person.”

The response was more favorable in New Orleans, where Mr. Cruz drew younger Republicans and local figures like William Goldring, a distillery executive, the restaurateur Dickie Brennan and Rob Maness, who ran for the Senate here in 2014.

Mr. Cruz, who has wandered into trouble at some private events by saying things he does not say in public, mainly stuck to policy, according to two attendees. But he also spoke more personally than he often did on the stump, describing his connections to Louisiana and praising the city’s music and cuisine.

He even poked a bit of good-natured fun at his wife’s dietary preferences, describing “what it’s like to be from Texas and have Christmas dinner with vegetarians.”",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,The New York Times
58,58,2099,Who's funding this pro-Ted Cruz super PAC?,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/06/politics/ted-cruz-super-pac/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.9,10.8,"Manchester, New Hampshire (XXX) A super PAC spending millions of dollars to bash Ted Cruz's Republican rivals is shielding the names of many of its top donors and strategists, accepting and directing donations through a particularly high number of hard-to-trace companies, new documents reveal. 
Stand for Truth, Inc., an emerging player in the orbit of often clashing constellation of pro-Cruz super PACs, recently pledged to air more than $4 million in television ads to back Cruz in Iowa and South Carolina. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions but are required to disclose their financial backers.
The twist here is that Stand for Truth has accepted more than $1 million in donations from corporations or limited liability companies, whose funders are difficult to uncover, meaning the original source of the campaign cash is hidden. While corporations can make donations to super PACs, an LLC allows individual donors to steer cash through easy-to-register, self-owned organizations. 
""LLCs seem to be a new vehicle for laundering money into elections,"" said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance reformer worried about donors essentially using them as shell companies to transfer cash anonymously. ""It's really hard to find out about LLCs. That's one of the reasons they've become popular.""
Stand for Truth has largely operated quietly, not responding to questions about new television advertisements from media and discarding with the in-the-news public profile maintained by many powerful groups in favor of a sparse website.
No leadership beyond the treasurer who filed its federal elections forms, a former counsel to Mitch McConnell named Eric Lycan, has publicly identified itself. Lycan has not responded to repeated requests for comment from XXX about the group's activities, and he declined to talk by phone this week. He did say in an email on Friday that the group was run by ""consultants from across the country committed to electing a courageous conservative as our next President.""
The main hand behind the super PAC is Josh Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Governors Association who now heads RedPrint Strategy, Lycan confirmed. Another name behind the group, Lycan said, is a Texas strategist named Keats Norfleet, who did not respond to requests for comment. 
Overall, Stand for Truth raised nearly $2.5 million last year in the brief time it had before the December 31 filing deadline. On Thursday, it purchased an additional $800,000 in negative advertisements attacking Marco Rubio in South Carolina.  
There is no evidence that routing the LLCs was a coordinated attempt to avoid disclosures, but the amount of cash donated is substantial.
Of the 29 individual contributions made to the group between Nov. 20 and Dec. 31, more than half of the gifts were not immediately connectable to an individual donor, the FEC report shows. On December 21, for instance, five seemingly identical donations in equal increments of $50,000 came from five different LLCs -- ""LL Baltimore, LLC""; ""LL Fort Wayne, LLC""; ""LL Peoria, LLC""; """"LL West Allis, LLC' and ""PF Fort Myers LLC.""
Many of the individuals plotting the group's plans remain unknown as well. The individuals receiving payment from Stand for Truth are all being paid through similar entities, with all but one company receiving payment using a limited liability companies or a limited liability partnership to accept the funds. 

It is not uncommon for vendors to receive payments from campaigns through groups like these, and some of those firms are easily identifiable, such Lycan's Kentucky-based law firm, Dinsmore and Shohl.
But LLCs are more difficult to crack. The Texas-based ""Stalwart Advisory LLC"" and Robinson's ""One Harbor LLC"" that the group used as consultants are not visible to the public without sleuthing through Texas public records. Stalwart Advisory does not appear in any state's corporate records, according to OpenCorporates.com, which tracks these filings, nor does One Harbor's ties to Robinson.
Lycan, asked why so much of the group's intake and outflow of cash were conducted through these LLC's declined to directly answer.
""Stand for Truth reports the information for each donor from whom a contribution is received, in accordance with applicable law,"" he wrote in an email.
Donors are increasingly using LLCs like these to give to political groups ever since the Citizens United decision made it easier for non-individuals to cut checks. But the prevalence of these opaque companies on Stand for Truth's report is widespread, campaign finance observers say. 
""The super PAC probably gets more corporate funding than most do by a pretty big margin, but still the bigger donors are individuals,"" said David Keating of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group advocating for looser restrictions on donations. ""This isn't Exxon Mobil corporate funding."" 
Stand for Truth, meant to add to menu of choices for high-dollar donors, has so far focused on negative television advertisements aimed at both Rubio and Donald Trump. A leading force behind the group, Lycan confirmed, is Hal Lambert, a Dallas money-manager who was a co-chair of the official campaign's finance committee until he started the outside group and is a close ally of Willie Langston, the Houston campaign's finance chair. 
And largely funding the group is Adam and Tara Ross, a Dallas couple close to Ted and Heidi Cruz who together gave $1 million of the $2.5 million raised. Adam Ross is influential in Jewish Republican fundraising circles and is said to be close with Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who has remained on the sidelines this year despite being wooed by much of the GOP field. 
The super PACs supporting Cruz that have been blessed by the candidate himself, a network titled Keep the Promise, has not used virtually any of these LLCs. The $40 million raised by Keep the Promise almost entirely comes from three families that each gave more than $10 million to support Cruz through their own independent groups -- with their names attached.",10.8,11.9,49.15,0.0,CNN
66,66,1093,Clinton Super PAC Ramps Up Spending Ahead of Next Round of Primaries,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/12/clinton-super-pac-ramps-up-spending-ahead-of-next-round-of-primaries/,clinton,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.4,8.4,"The pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC is ramping up its spending ahead of a series of nominating contests, following Mrs. Clinton’s loss in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary.
The super PAC, Priorities USA Action, is running a $500,000 radio ad campaign promoting Mrs. Clinton in South Carolina, where Democrats vote Feb. 27. The ad casts Mrs. Clinton as best equipped to continue President Barack Obama‘s policies and praises her experience and record.
It is also launching a $4.5 million radio, digital and mail ad campaign to boost early turnout by black, Latino and female voters in states with March primaries. The effort will be implemented together with the environmental group League of Conservation Voters and Emily’s List, which promotes female pro-choice candidates.
The burst in spending by Priorities, which had originally intended to save its funds for the general election, suggests Clinton allies are concerned about the tougher-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Following her loss by more than 20 points in New Hampshire and her razor-thin win in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton needs victories in Nevada and South Carolina.
Priorities raised $41 million in 2015, and another $10 million through January. It previously spent about $400,000 boosting Mrs. Clinton in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early-nominating states. It has not spent any money attacking Mr. Sanders.
Priorities officials said they expect the early voting campaign to target all March states, and said it will focus on states with in-person early voting such as Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina.
Guy Cecil, the super PAC’s chief strategist, said he expects the campaign to boost Mrs. Clinton in both the general and the primary elections. “We have always seen as our primary responsibility the general election, making sure that Hillary wins, and we have always thought we would assess where we were, to make sure we were doing everything possible to build a long-term coalition for her campaign,” he said in a written statement.
The super PAC spending has already drawn criticism from Mr. Sanders. In a message to supporters on Friday, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said, “It is truly unfortunate that the largest pro-Clinton super PAC has decided to infect the Democratic primary process with its haul of Wall Street cash.”
Mr. Sanders also has received at least $1.5 million in backing from a super PAC run by the nurses union, filings with the Federal Election Commission show.",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The Wall Street Journal
96,96,240,First Draft: Donald Trump Holds Firm on Criticism of George W. Bush,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/14/donald-trump-holds-firm-on-criticism-of-george-w-bush/,trump,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,5.6,6.8,"The morning after the Republican presidential primary debate, Donald J. Trump said he had no regrets about saying that the George W. Bush administration “lied” in taking the nation to war in Iraq, despite the criticism Mr. Trump received.

“I could be very quiet, I could say, ‘Oh that’s wonderful,’ or I could say, ‘Excuse me, the World Trade Center'” came down during President George W. Bush’s tenure, Mr. Trump said.

During the debate, discussing the war in Iraq, Mr. Trump said, “George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty.”

“We should have never been in Iraq,” Mr. Trump said. “They lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none and they knew that there were none.” Jeb Bush defended his brother, as did Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a reflection of the former president’s durable popularity with Republicans in South Carolina, where primary voters will cast ballots on Saturday.

The remark was seen as potentially harmful to Mr. Trump with voters who still view Mr. Bush positively and who see “they lied” as similar to the type of attack that Democrats lobbed against Mr. Bush in 2004 and beyond. But Mr. Trump said on Sunday that he was unconcerned about any damage it could cause his candidacy here.

“If it does, it does — I have to tell the truth,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m a big boy.”

He reiterated that the war was a “terrible, terrible mistake” that cost the nation dearly in American lives and money, a comment he has frequently made during the campaign.

However, he softened his comment about Mr. Bush slightly, saying his remarks were “not against Bush, per se. It’s against the war.” But he again added, “He was the one that made that mistake.”",6.8,5.6,76.22,0.0,The New York Times
