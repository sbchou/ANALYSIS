6,6,1475,First Draft: Bernie Sanders a Target of Ads by Republican Donor,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/25/bernie-sanders-a-target-of-ads-by-republican-donor/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"A “super PAC” founded by the former TD Ameritrade executive Joe Ricketts is spending more than $600,000 on a television ad in Iowa lashing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as “too liberal” in the final days of his close race against Hillary Clinton in the state’s caucuses. 

The spot, being aired by the ESA Fund, describes Mr. Sanders’s policy positions on a range of issues, such as tuition-free college and single-payer health care, saying that it amounts to a flood of new government spending. There will be tax increases on Wall Street, big businesses and the “super-rich,” the ad goes on to say. 

The spot is expected to be backed by $600,000 in spending on television ads, and there will be additional expenditures on radio and digital advertising. 

Mr. Ricketts has been a major Republican donor this cycle in the presidential race, but with the ad, his group is injecting itself into the Democratic nominating contest.

“When it comes to federal spending and piling on our massive debt, Secretary Clinton is a five-car pile-up, but Senator Sanders is a trainwreck,” said Brian Baker, the president of the ESA Fund. “Given that Senator Sanders is the leading candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire and way ahead in the general election polls, ESAFund will work hard to inform voters about his record and future plans.” Mr. Sanders leads in many head- many national polls.

ESA Fund is the affiliated super PAC of Ending Spending, which was founded by Mr. Ricketts and is operated by his son, Todd Ricketts, who is on the board of the Chicago Cubs. It is laser-trained on fighting what it considers excess spending by the government. 

The elder Mr. Ricketts gave $5 million to the super PAC that backed Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race last fall. And Todd Ricketts helped run Mr. Walker’s national fundraising efforts for his campaign. 

Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said he had not seen the ad but added, “Are they against strengthening Social Security? Raising the minimum wage? Don’t they want to make college affordable? Do they like Wall Street and big banks? Do they want to keep tax loopholes that let profitable corporations evade taxes?”

Despite the current general election match-ups in public polling, Mr. Sanders is far less known nationally than Hillary Clinton, meaning his negative ratings are lower. 

The strategy of attacking Mr. Sanders seems reminiscent of how Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a Democrat, ran ads targeting Todd Akin, a conservative and the opponent she most wanted to face because he seemed less electable in a general election. That is also the bar that Mr. Sanders has been fighting to clear.",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,The New York Times

In the video, veteran diplomat Wendy Sherman reveals that in the interest of speed, Clinton and her aides would share information that ""would never be on an unclassified system"" normally. 
The questions surround a 2013 speech in which Sherman compared the technology differences between serving at the State Department in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Obama. 
""Now we have BlackBerries, and it has changed the way diplomacy is done,"" Sherman, who was undersecretary of state at the time, said in the 2013 on-camera remarks. ""Things appear on your BlackBerries that would never be on an unclassified system. But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.""
Clinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. 
The Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. 
In Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. 
The secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. 
""So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,"" said Sherman. ""To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.""
The Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.
Previous email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. 
The State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. 
The conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves ""foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,"" so it was born classified when the emails were created. 
""Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,"" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. ""This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.""
A Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new XXX News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. 
The polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important.

100,100,473,Op-Ed Columnist: Is There Any Stopping Donald Trump?,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/opinion/is-there-any-stopping-donald-trump.html,trump,nyt,Abortion,8.4,8.4,"Over the last few months and even weeks, the question among many flabbergasted Republican traditionalists and incredulous political analysts was when the forces of gravity would catch up with Donald Trump and send him tumbling to earth.

It was going to happen. Of course it was going to happen. You just had to be patient. You just had to be strong.

But in the wake of his victories in New Hampshire and now South Carolina, the question is no longer “when.” It’s “if.” And the answer isn’t clear at all.

Consider this: From 1980 forward, no Republican presidential candidate has won both the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries and gone on to lose the party’s nomination.

And this: Over that same time period, only one Republican victor in South Carolina failed to become the nominee, and that was Newt Gingrich, in 2012. But Gingrich didn’t have Trump’s durable (and sizeable) lead in national polls. He didn’t dominate the race’s narrative and capture an exasperated electorate’s mood the way Trump has.

As it happens, Gingrich was on XXX News on Saturday night to discuss Trump’s latest triumph, and he didn’t say: “South Carolina? It’s a muggy, marshy, inconsequential tease. I bagged it four years ago and all it got me was this gig babbling in the wee hours about election returns.”

No, Gingrich marveled at what he made clear was “a huge night for Donald Trump.”

“Nobody should kid themselves,” he added.

Trump didn’t just win South Carolina, and he didn’t just win it by a margin of 10 points. He won it despite what looked, over recent days, like a concerted effort to lose it. He won it after what appeared to be one of the worst weeks that a candidate could have.

It began at the most recent debate, where he trashed the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and accused him of lying to the American people as he led them into war in Iraq. He sounded like a liberal Democrat. Republican primary voters, especially those in the South, aren’t typically receptive to that.

Over the next days, Trump sounded even more like a liberal Democrat, at least as described by Ted Cruz, who went after him relentlessly, armed with Trump’s own past statements in support of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood.

The week got messier from there. Trump picked a fight with the Pope. Trump picked a fight with Apple. It became evident that no personage or brand, no matter how beloved, was safe from his wrath. You had to wonder what or whom he’d go after next. Kittens? Betty Crocker? Betty White?

Then Trump spoke up for a key aspect of Obamacare before realizing what he’d done and assuring everyone that he deplored every aspect of Obamacare, which paled in comparison with Trumpcare, whatever that might turn out to be.

This prompted extensive commentary on Trump’s inconsistencies and a fresh round of murmuring about an imminent tumble.

But what we incredulous political analysts keep failing to take into account—what I was reminded of when I went to a Trump rally last week and listened hard to his supporters—is that the people voting for him aren’t evaluating him through any usual ideological lens. They’re not asking what kind of Republican he is. They’re not troubling themselves with whether the position he’s selling today matches the position he was selling yesterday or even what that old position was.

They want to try something utterly different—utterly disruptive, to use the locution du jour—and that leaves them, on the Republican side, with the options of Trump and Ben Carson. Trump has the fire.

One woman told me that she loves the idea of a billionaire who is funding his own candidacy and won’t be beholden to contributors and special interests. Wouldn’t that be refreshing? Couldn’t that be transformative? Why not give it a shot?

She’d also been to a Marco Rubio rally and was impressed: what a nice young man. But she’s not in the market for nice and young, not this time around.

Another woman told me that she craves a president who is fearless, really fearless, and that of all the candidates in the race, Trump seems the least bowed, the least cowed. She trusts him to fight. All he does is fight. And a fight is what’s in order.

A man who served in the Air Force and now works as a trucker told me that over several decades, through several presidents, the Veterans Administration has remained dysfunctional and his wages haven’t gone up. If he keeps voting the same way, for the same run-of-the-mill politicians, shouldn’t he expect more of the same? Trump isn’t the same.

Gingrich analyzed his appeal perfectly during that XXX News appearance. “It’s a very simple rule,” he said. “If you think Washington is so sick you want someone to kick over the kitchen table, then you like Donald Trump and you frankly don’t care about the details.”

In an exit poll of voters who participated in the Republican primary on Saturday, there was a near even split between those who said that the best preparation for the presidency was political experience and those who put more faith in someone from outside the political establishment. Rubio performed best with the former group, getting 38 percent of their votes. But Trump performed best with the latter group—and got 63 percent of theirs.

Going forward, Rubio is probably the bigger threat to Trump than Cruz, who won only 26 percent of South Carolina voters who identified themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians despite having campaigned as narrowly and relentlessly as possible for their favor. More of them chose Trump, who got 34 percent of the evangelical vote, and plenty of them chose Rubio, who got 21 percent.

That potentially spells trouble for Cruz in the Southern states on Super Tuesday that he’d hoped to dominate. Rubio, meanwhile, is better positioned than Cruz to pick up former supporters of Jeb Bush, who ended his candidacy Saturday night, and to compete well in states outside the South.

And in the days and weeks to come, Rubio will get even more help and money than he has so far from Republican bigwigs who are desperate to see someone less truculent and divisive than Trump or Cruz burst into the lead. His South Carolina showing redeemed his New Hampshire embarrassment and renewed their faith.

But Rubio hasn’t notched a single victory yet. Trump has notched two, and whether they fully lived up to the advance polling is irrelevant. They’re victories, plural. They’re no fluke, no fad.

Naysayers can’t claim that he’s just a bad gaffe or an ugly revelation away from doom. There have already been gaffes aplenty—if you can call them gaffes. There have been revelations galore.

All Trump’s fans see is someone barreling forward without apology and with a largeness that makes them feel a little less small. They see a winner. And it’s no longer an illusion.",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The New York Times
106,106,396,Jeb Bush on Donald Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/06/politics/jeb-bush-isis-donald-trump/index.html,trump,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,8.7,10.0,"Bedford, New Hampshire (XXX) Just hours before Saturday night's Republican debate in New Hampshire, Jeb Bush fired up his biggest crowd to date with digs against rival Donald Trump and exuded blunt confidence when addressing concerns about his family name.
The Republican presidential candidate, who's aiming for a top tier finish in next week's primary after his poor showing in Iowa, delivered a strong performance here at his midday town hall in Bedford, showing a mix of humor and emotion before a packed crowd.
Outside were even more people who were turned away from the fire marshal after capacity was reached in the middle school's gymnasium. With just a few days before polling booths open up on Tuesday, voters are still shopping around to make their final decision.
After delivering his stump speech, the first man to ask a question lit into Trump for mocking a reporter with a disability late last year -- something Trump denies doing.
The voter identified himself as a longtime boxing fan and drew an analogy comparing the rivalry between Trump and Bush to a famous boxing match in 1980 between John Tate and Mike Weaver, in which Weaver was losing for 14 rounds until he came back in the 15th round to knock out Tate. 
""Governor, you're Mike Weaver,"" the man said. ""Throw that punch tonight.""
After the crowd erupted in agreement, Bush highlighted his own record of helping people with disabilities, and as he's been doing for weeks, lambasted Trump for what he calls his habit of ""disparaging"" people, suggesting this time that his rival candidate needs a visit to the couch.  
""It's just ridiculous. It's a sign of deep insecurity. I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but the guy needs therapy,"" Bush said to applause and laughter.
Bush also had some criticism for his other rivals ahead of Saturday night's debate on ABC News. The former Florida governor mocked Sen. Ted Cruz's proposal to ""carpet bomb"" ISIS, saying that's an old school technique and the military has precise weaponry that eliminates the need to carpet bomb.
He then turned to Trump's proposal. ""Or say that you are going to bomb the S-H-blank-blank out of ISIS? Really? Is that a serious thought?""
In a not-so-subtle knock against Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio -- both first-term senators -- Bush made his pitch that the country needs an experienced leader. ""We're living in dangerous times. We're not running for the back bench of the United States Senate, we're running for the presidency of the United States,"" he said. ""And you need to have someone who knows what he's doing.""
The more candid Bush also offered a blunt rebuttal to one voter's question about Bush's last name. The young woman said she was a big fan of the family, but asked how can Bush persuade other millennials who are opposed to another Bush in the White House.
The candidate referenced his campaign's college network that spans hundreds of campus, but then grew more forthright in his rhetoric about his last name.
""The Bush thing, people are just going to have to get over it, alright?"" he said to big applause.
Bush, as he's been doing lately, said he's been characterized as an ""establishment"" candidate because his father and brother were both presidents.
""I got no problems with this,"" he said. ""And people that do, they either need to get therapy themselves or realize that we can change the course of this country working together to solve problems.""
To show his embrace of his last name, Bush brought out his mother, Barbara Bush, on the campaign trail this week, and his brother is set to campaign with him in South Carolina before the state's primary later this month.  
But Bush's answer wasn't the first time his brother or father's name came up at the event. Earlier, Bush was being introduced by Tom Ridge, and the former Homeland Security Secretary slipped up, saying ""George Bush"" instead of ""Jeb Bush.""
""By the way, I worked for his brother and I love his dad, so excuse me for the mess-up because I think this is a legacy of principled leadership and that's exactly what Jeb Bush would bring to the White House,"" Ridge said.

Despite all the tough talk about his rivals, Bush also showed a softer side on Saturday. When he was asked about drug addiction -- a huge problem in New Hampshire -- Bush signaled he was about to share his daughter's story about her former struggle with the issue. But he paused.
""OK, I've not done this next to Columba,"" he said, before he walked over to his wife, who was sitting in the front row, to briefly grab her hand.
Then he paused again, looked at his feet, and started choking up as he began to talk about how Noelle ""spiraled out of control"" more than a decade ago. It's a story he shares often, and he's even done it with his daughter in attendance. But Saturday marked the first time that he grew emotional in front of an audience when talking about it.
It's also the second time in the past few days that Bush choked up at a town hall. He struggled Thursday night as well when his mother was at an event in Derry and Bush mentioned his ""idyllic"" father, whose health makes it difficult for him to make public appearances.
Aside from his emotional moment on Saturday, Bush also had some fun with the audience. He praised the voters for asking ""real"" questions, winning laughs and applause when he said ""the questions on the debate stage will be probably really stupid to be honest with you.""
He also defended his Super Bowl pick of the Denver Broncos because he's a fan of Peyton Manning. After some in the New England crowd moaned and groaned -- this is Patriots country -- Bush protested.
""Hey, just a second here"" he said, playfully putting his foot down. ""I'm for Peyton Manning because he's for me.""
As the audience went wild, Bush had one more thing to add: ""He's also managed to be the, uh, the adult in the room -- kinda like me.""",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,CNN
