20,20,1590,Sanders surpasses 2015 fundraising goal with sizable haul,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/02/politics/bernie-sanders-fundraising-hillary-clinton/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,9.9,10.0,"Amherst, Massachusetts (XXX) Bernie Sanders raised $33 million in the final three months of 2015, his campaign said in a statement Saturday, failing to outraise Hillary Clinton but smashing the goal aides set when the Vermont senator launched his campaign back in May.
Sanders' haul -- which brings his 2015 total to $73 million -- was almost exclusively buoyed by his prodigious online fundraising operation. Aides told XXX that Sanders received over 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.
Clinton's campaign announced Friday that it raised $37 million for the primary campaign in the last three months of 2015, easily surpassing the $100 million goal the campaign had set earlier in the year.
""This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,"" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement on Saturday. ""What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support. We are making history and we are proud of it."" 
The final quarter of 2015 also saw Sanders dramatically increase his spending. According to aides, the campaign ended 2015 with $28.4 million cash on hand. That is only $2 million more than the $26.2 million the campaign had in the bank at the end of the third quarter of 2015, meaning Sanders' operation spent the bulk of what they raised in the fourth quarter.
Much of that spending, according to aides, was focused on building infrastructure in early primary states, including deploying organizers to South Carolina and Nevada, and building the campaign's already existing organization in Iowa and New Hampshire.
For the year, Sanders' campaign spent 61% of the money it brought in.
 
Sanders has long been a formidable fundraiser with deep roots in online and small donor fundraising, but even some of his closest aides were unsure he could raise the money needed to run a presidential campaign when the launched earlier this year. Tad Devine, his top strategist, said that the operation had hoped to bring in between $40 and $50 million by the end of 2015.
Sanders smashed that goal, but in a dramatically different way than Clinton did.
A bulk of Clinton's haul came from fundraisers she or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, personally headlined. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. And the former president headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter.
According to XXX's analysis, fundraisers personally headlined by Clinton brought in at least $22 million in the forth quarter.
Sanders, however, only headlined two fundraisers in the last three months of 2015, bringing his year total to nine, while Clinton's total for the year was 174.
What's more, almost all of Sanders' donors have yet to reach the $2,700 max donation, according to aides, who said Saturday that only around 600 Sanders supporters have maxed out.
That means Sanders' campaign can continue to hit up their donors for small donations as the primary calendar moves along.
Sanders' campaign has also raised big money at notable moments in the fourth quarter. Sanders' aides bragged that the campaign raised $2.5 million in the two days after the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas.
And the day after the campaign breached the Clinton campaign's voter data -- and subsequently sued the Democratic National Committee -- aides said the campaign raised more than $1 million.",9.6,9.5,60.65,-0.4,CNN,Bernie Sanders

Before about 1,000 people packed into a Des Moines church, Sanders said that while he works closely with President Barack Obama, ""I do not agree with him on his policy toward deportation."" And O'Malley bemoaned the timing of the raids, stating that ""Jesus himself was a refugee child.""
Both candidates had previously criticized the raids, which first became public when The Washington Post published a story about the plans just before Christmas.
The White House defended the policies Friday. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said the raids reflected the administration's top priorities for deportation  people with criminal convictions and people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. But critics said the searches were ill-timed and disruptive for families.
Offering support for comprehensive immigration reform at the Putting Families First Presidential Forum, Sanders and O'Malley also slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump over his statements about Muslims. O'Malley, a former governor of Maryland, called Trump an ""immigrant-bashing carnival barker.""
Sanders, a U.S. senator for Vermont, said he would ""do everything I can to stand up to the Donald Trumps of the world and their bigotry and their xenophobia.""
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads the polls in the leadoff caucus state, with Sanders coming in second and O'Malley lagging far behind.  Clinton did not attend the forum.
In a statement released after the plan became public, Clinton spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said Clinton ""believes the United States should give refuge to people fleeing persecution. ... She believes we should not be conducting large-scale raids and roundups that sow fear and division in our communities.""
Clinton has campaigned heavily in Iowa, but some in the crowd of liberal activists were not pleased that she did not join them. At one point some people began to chant ""Where is Clinton?""
Sanders and O'Malley both offered a variety of proposals to support the middle class. O'Malley pledged to increase federal investment in transportation and affordable housing. Sanders said he'd like to see basic banking services offered at post offices to help people avoid predatory lending.",8.8,11.1,45.76,0.0,the Associated Press,Bernie Sanders
42,42,1885,New Yorkers blast Cruz's comments on 'New York values',http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-01-15-US--Cruz-New%20York%20Values/id-1d883b4be3d04a2898b9dafad2200b02,cruz,ap,Campaign Finance,8.4,8.4,"(XXX)  When Ted Cruz sneered at what he called Donald Trump's ""New York values,"" some New Yorkers took it very personally. And some responded about the way you'd expect New Yorkers to react.
The ever-combative Daily News hit the streets with a big front-page illustration of the Statue of Liberty giving Cruz the finger. The headline: ""DROP DEAD, TED."" And in a reference to the Texas senator's birthplace, the tabloid added: ""You don't like N.Y. values? Go back to Canada!""
On the morning after Thursday night's Republican presidential debate, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took to the airwaves to denounce the candidate and demand an apology for comments he called ""obnoxious on every level.""
The use of ""New York values"" as a term of abuse rankled plenty of city residents.
""Like that's a bad thing?"" said Willie Perry, a real estate salesman and registered Republican, as he headed to work in New York City. ""Actually it's a good thing. I think that's ludicrous. What did he mean by that?""
John Markowski, a minister who was dropping his son off at a public school, said: ""It's insulting for anyone to make a derogatory comment about New York values. I think we pride ourselves on being a place of diversity and equality.""
During the debate, moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Cruz to explain past comments he had made about Trump embodying ""New York values.""
""You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are,"" Cruz said.
""I am from New York. I don't,"" Bartiromo said.
So the GOP conservative explained: ""Listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.""
Trump responded movingly by citing the city's response to 9/11.
""When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,"" he said to applause from the crowd in North Charleston, South Carolina. ""We rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.""
He added: ""And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.""
One in 38 Americans lives in New York City, but the state's record of going for the Democrat in the winner-take-all electoral college system means Republicans rarely have to worry about insulting the populace. Bashing the big city has long been a winning strategy in more conservative parts of the country, namely the Midwest and the South.
Not a lot of New Yorkers have given money to Cruz's bid for the White House. His campaign took in only about $487,000 from New York contributors through Sept. 30, according to the most recent filings. But one New Yorker, Wall Street hedge fund mogul Robert Mercer, contributed $11 million last April to a super PAC that supports Cruz.
Cruz ""has no trouble taking money from New York City, but he's quick to insult our people and our values,"" said Mayor Bill de Blasio, a liberal Democrat.",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,the Associated Press,Ted Cruz
78,78,980,"Ahead of Nevada caucus, Clinton goes up with first Spanish-language ads",http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/hillary-clinton-spanish-ads-nevada/index.html,clinton,cnn,Immigration,11.1,11.2,"Manchester, New Hampshire  (XXX) Hillary Clinton's campaign released its first Spanish-language TV and radio ads on Friday, highlighting the former secretary of state's position on immigration reform ahead of Nevada's caucuses later this month.
The ad, titled ""Valentía"" (which means ""courage"" or ""bravery"" in English) is the campaign's first Spanish-language ad in the Silver State and casts Clinton as a friend of Latinos at a time when Republican candidates are talking about deportation and denying undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship.
""There is no other candidate who has fought as hard for our families as Hillary Clinton,"" a narrator says in Spanish. ""She stands with us to achieve immigration reform and to keep families together.""
The TV ad opens with a shot of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, two Republicans who have been outspoken about strict immigration standards, and the narrator says, ""It's when things get tough that you see the friends by your side.""
""There is still much to do, but with a friend like Hillary, we keep moving forward,"" the narrator concludes.
Nevada's caucuses, the first in the West, are on February 23. There has been a dearth of polling in the state, but surveys from late last year had Clinton up by double digits over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN,Hillary Clinton
81,81,1176,Hillary Clinton hopes for strong Latino turnout in Nevada,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/nevada-caucus-democrats-2016/index.html,clinton,cnn,Immigration,13.0,12.0,"Las Vegas (XXX) Bracing for another close race in a state that was once viewed as her firewall, Hillary Clinton is counting on a strong turnout among Latino voters in the Nevada caucuses Saturday to hold off Bernie Sanders' momentum in this critical swing state.
With polling showing a dead heat between Clinton and Sanders among likely caucusgoers, Clinton's surrogates fanned out across the Silver State this week, attempting to portray her as the more trustworthy candidate for Latinos as they work to ramp up participation by her supporters in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County.
In the final days, Clinton's allies have slashed Sanders' immigration record, criticizing him as a ""johnny-come-lately"" to the issue who has been too vague about his plans. At the same time, they have continued their push for Clinton in Nevada's rural counties -- where Clinton's canvassers have been pressing the case that Sanders' proposals are unrealistic and unachievable in the current political climate.
A strong win would provide a jolt of momentum to Clinton heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.
A loss, or even another close finish with Sanders in Nevada, would further chip away at the aura of electability that once surrounded her path to the nomination, serving as a testament to the strength of Sanders' momentum even in a heavily Latino state where she was organized six months ahead of him. 
An estimated 40% of the state's Democratic voters are non-white -- and Clinton was expected to show her strength among minority voters with a good showing here. But Sanders has emphasized his family's immigrant roots here in ads and on the campaign trail, noting that his father was a Polish immigrant to America who originally spoke little English. 
""Immigration isn't just a word for Bernie Sanders,"" the narrator said in one Spanish-language radio ad for his campaign in November. ""His story is the immigrant story."" 
Beyond Clinton's breakneck campaign schedule here this week, there were other signs of concern within her campaign about the unexpected strength of the Sanders effort here.
On the same day that Clinton released an emotional immigration ad featuring Clinton talking to a tearful 10-year-old girl about the deportation letter that her parents received, her operatives added a half-million dollars to their ad spending on broadcast, satellite and cable for a total of $3.4 million to Sanders' $3.7 million, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising.
The Clinton campaign is also clearly looking at caucus states beyond Nevada, dispatching Bill Clinton to speak to voters in the upcoming contest of Colorado even as the post-caucus celebrations get underway in Nevada Saturday evening.
Clinton repeatedly dropped in on employees at the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in her efforts to boost Clark County turnout. Both campaigns had heavily courted the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which supported Obama in 2008 and helped him turn out voters to caucus. But in a blow to Clinton's campaign, they chose to stay neutral this year.
Still, the former secretary of state greeted workers from that union during an overnight stop at Caesar's Palace Thursday after flying in from Chicago. Both she and her husband will visit the caucus site -- which is aimed at making it easier for Strip shift workers to participate during their work day -- at Caesar's Palace on Saturday afternoon while the caucus is underway.   
""I know you do a hard job,"" she told Caesar's Palace housekeeping workers during her overnight visit to their linen room. She said that when she arrived at the hotel, she had asked herself: ""Who is still working?""
""A lot of people are,"" she said, before asking the workers to caucus for her at the hotel Saturday.
Like Obama in 2008, Sanders is counting on a strong turnout from first-time caucusgoers, though not nearly as many are expected as eight years ago when some 120,000 turned out.
Though Clinton is perceived as having an advantage with voters in Clark County, in part because of her strong support from labor unions, the Vermont senator spent a good amount of time campaigning around the populous areas of Las Vegas this week before heading to Elko, Nevada, on Friday to rally rural voters.
During both an XXX forum and a speech at the Clark County Democratic Dinner on Thursday night, Sanders made a direct pitch to Latinos by chiding Donald Trump for vilifying immigrants. He argued that Congress ""must move towards a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants.""
""While I understand that there are people who have differences of opinion with me on immigration reform, there is no justification, no reason, to resort to bigotry and xenophobia when we are talking about Mexicans or we are talking about Muslims,"" Sanders said at the Democratic dinner at the Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.
""People can disagree about immigration reform, but in the year 2016, we will not allow the Trumps and others to divide us up and appeal to racism, which has done this country so much harm for so many years,"" he said.
During the XXX/Telemundo forum, Sanders also defended his 2007 vote against legislation that would have revamped the immigration system, stating that he objected to guest-worker provisions that were described by one legal advocacy group as being ""akin to slavery.""  
Both Sanders and Clinton have also made an aggressive play for Nevada's rural voters this cycle. Clinton won the popular vote here in 2008. But by organizing in the delegate-rich rural counties of Nevada, Obama won more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Clinton.
Clinton is heavily organized in those rural counties this time. The looming question is whether her campaign will be able to overcome the enthusiasm for Sanders, as well as a palpable level of discomfort with her position on gun control compared to Sanders' more moderate stances. 
At a town hall in Elko Friday morning, Sanders stressed the importance of turnout among rural voters to his campaign, calling on them to show the world the desire for a ""political revolution that transforms this country.""
""I really believe this from my heart of hearts: obviously we are here to win and hope to win. I want democracy to flourish,"" the Vermont senator said. ""I hope Nevada turns out -- I hope we have a YUGE turnout -- I'm afraid to use that word! But I hope we have a very, very large voter turnout. Show the world that democracy is alive and well in Nevada.""
