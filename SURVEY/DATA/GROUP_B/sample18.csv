24,24,1573,"Sanders goes negative with Goldman Sachs, Iraq jabs",http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/sanders-negative-goldman-sachs-iraq/index.html,sanders,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,11.1,11.2,"Carroll, Iowa (XXX) Bernie Sanders has a new bus for the last two weeks before the all-important caucuses in Iowa and also a new strategy: attacking Hillary Clinton where she's most vulnerable. 
Sanders has been inching there for months now, but he finally dropped the nice-guy routine this week -- and with an only slightly coy hit on knitting together Clinton's fabled speaking fees and her Wall Street connections.
""By the way, without naming any names, Goldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates,"" Sanders said, as the crowd chuckled. ""Very generous. Now I know that some of my opponents are very good speakers, very fine orators, very smart people, but you gotta be really really, really good to get $225,000 a speech. That's all I'll say.""
He obviously did not need to name names; a member of the audience yelled, ""It was $600,000!"" 
Sanders laughed and said, ""That's for three speeches."" 
His audience didn't seem to mind that the senator, who declared months ago that he wouldn't go negative, was now doing exactly that.
At the top of his speeches Tuesday in Fort Dodge and Carroll, Sanders spoke about the movement and revolution (as he likes to call it) that his campaign is bringing across America, boasting that 450,000 people have come to see his campaign speeches in the past eight months.
""You may hear me say a word or two about my friend Donald Trump but not my Democratic colleagues, who are serious people,"" Sanders said. He also pointed to the name-calling and candidates ""ripping into each other,"" which seems like a not-so-subtle hit at Trump.
But then only a few minutes later, Sanders criticized Clinton's campaign fundraising tactics and the spending of her super PAC, pointing out that he is proud to not have the support of an official super PAC. At the bottom of his official campaign emails, a note says, ""Paid for by Bernie, not the billionaires.""

Sanders sharp tone comes as he has arisen as a serious threat to swipe the Democratic nomination from Clinton. Facing a possible repeat of 2008, Clinton has unloaded on Sanders as well -- painting him as an impractical radical and someone who could ultimately lose the White House for Democrats.
Clinton's latest hit was a letter from top diplomats questioning Sanders' ability to handle serious international situations, including relations with Iran. 
""The stakes are high. And we are concerned that Sen. Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security,"" the diplomats wrote in their letter. ""His lack of a strategy for defeating ISIS -- one of the greatest challenges we face today -- is troubling. And the limited things he has said on ISIS are also troubling.""
At a stop in Underwood, as Sanders took questions from the crowd, one woman pointed out to him that he's taking some heat for ""not having foreign policy experience."" Sanders' defense rests in the logic that experience does not equal good judgment. 
His example? Dick Cheney, who Sanders remarked, ""had a hell of a lot of experience, God help us all.""
But much like the 2008 election where a fresh-faced senator touted his opposition against the war in Iraq, Sanders reminded the audience of Clinton's voting record on the matter, saying that she dutifully listened to Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld. ""She voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of the United States of America,"" he said.

Mo Elleithee, former communications director for the Democratic Party and a veteran of numerous White House bids, including Clinton's 2008 run, said he doesn't think attacking Clinton will hurt Sanders -- unless he goes too far.
""Unless he crosses a line, I doubt it hurts him. On some level, he wants to be careful, he promises to be something to be different, at a certain point he can take it too far and look like everyone else,"" Elleithee said. 
He added the last two weeks before the Iowa caucuses are when candidates want to excite supporters, but it also ""has the potential for backfiring if he looks too typical.""",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN
33,33,1827,First Draft: Ted Cruz to Begin 6-Day Bus Tour to Help Him Secure Lead in Iowa,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/04/ted-cruz-to-begin-6-day-bus-tour-to-help-him-hold-onto-lead-in-iowa/,cruz,nyt,Immigration,5.2,6.4,"For weeks, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been perched atop the Iowa polls despite a conspicuous omission from his campaign calendar: appearances in Iowa.

On Monday, Mr. Cruz returns to the state for the first time in about a month. The trip will not be subtle.

He is setting off on a six-day, 28-town bus tour intended to cement his status as the state’s front-runner. The campaign, prone to frequently using puns, has labeled the trip as the “Cruzin’ to Caucus” tour.

The visit comes after a week in which two rivals, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, sought to capitalize on Mr. Cruz’s absence from the state with appearances of their own. Mr. Cruz is also facing increasingly aggressive attacks from his competitors, including the campaigns or allies of Mr. Rubio, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Huckabee.

Even Donald J. Trump, who has largely resisted jabs at Mr. Cruz, is showing signs of frustration. In an apparent knock on Mr. Cruz’s faith, Mr. Trump has repeatedly said, vaguely but ominously, that not many evangelicals come from Cuba.",6.4,5.2,77.23,0.0,The New York Times
69,69,1146,First Draft: Hillary Clinton to Highlight Core Supporters on Anniversary of Roe v. Wade,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/22/hillary-clinton-to-highlight-core-supporters-on-anniversary-of-roe-v-wade/,clinton,nyt,Abortion,8.7,8.8,"As the Democratic presidential primary race has taken a harsher turn in the last few days, Hillary Clinton will try to focus on the group of supporters she hopes will lift her candidacy — women — as she campaigns in New Hampshire.

Mrs. Clinton will appear at a dinner in Manchester hosted by Naral Pro-Choice New Hampshire, to celebrate the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The dinner will also feature the state’s Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen.

(Mrs. Clinton is not the only candidate who will be focusing on the anniversary. Carly Fiorina, the only woman running on the Republican side and a candidate who has been deeply critical of Planned Parenthood, is scheduled to appear at a March for Life event in Washington, weather permitting.)

But for Mrs. Clinton, the rally is a chance to focus on her base of voters as polls show her losing ground to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mrs. Clinton has made protecting abortion rights a key component of her campaign and she has received the backing of the Naral Pro-Choice America PAC. 

Mr. Sanders has seized on the endorsements from Naral and from Planned Parenthood’s political arm as evidence that Mrs. Clinton is part of the so-called establishment who is backed by special interest groups. Her campaign has fought that label, with allies pointing out that protecting abortion rights is also a central part of the Democratic Party’s agenda.

It has been a rough week for Mrs. Clinton. But rather than seek distance from the “establishment” mantle, Mrs. Clinton has tightly embraced it. Whether that will work in an election cycle characterized by so much voter anger remains to be seen.",8.8,8.7,62.68,0.0,The New York Times

The WABE 90.1 poll of 400 Georgians who said they were going to vote in the March 1 Republican primary found 41% of those surveyed supported Mr. Trump; 18% backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and 15% were behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. About 8% supported Dr. Ben Carson and 7% supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The poll found Mr. Trump leading substantially among various groups, including self-described evangelical voters, conservatives and Republicans who consider themselves liberal or moderate.
Researchers conducted the Internet polling, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points, from Feb. 22 to Feb. 24. The poll follows several other recent polls that showed Mr. Trump leading in Georgia by at least 9 points, with Mr. Cruz coming in second and Mr. Rubio in third place.

107,107,761,Trump deflects specifics when it comes to abortion position,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/politics/donald-trump-abortion/index.html,trump,cnn,Abortion,8.7,8.8,"Marshalltown, Iowa  (XXX) Donald Trump touted the strength of his anti-abortion position during a press conference Tuesday, but dodged questions testing the specificity of those views.
The press conference comes less than a week before Iowa's traditionally conservative Republican voters head to caucus sites and the same day a group of an anti-abortion leaders urged Iowans to oppose Trump's candidacy, suggesting inconsistencies on the issue.
""All I can tell you is this I'm pro-life and I've been pro-life a long time,"" Trump said Tuesday.
But Trump said in 1999 that while he hated the ""concept of abortion"" he was ""pro-choice."" On the 2016 campaign trail, Trump has positioned himself as an opponent of legalized abortion.
Asked what penalties he would support for women who undergo abortions or doctors who perform them, Trump demurred.
""I just don't want to talk about that right now. Everybody knows my views and I think my views are very plain,"" Trump said.
Addressing supporters following the press conference, Trump conceded that his views on abortion have changed and noted that when he was just a businessman he ""never gave it much thought.""
""When it comes to pro-life I've evolved,"" Trump said.
Asked by reporters whether he considers Plan B, the morning after pill, to be the same as an abortion, Trump again would not divulge his position.
Instead, Trump touted a recent endorsement from prominent evangelical leader Jerry Falwell, Jr., the president of the evangelical Liberty University and son of its founder, and pointed to poll numbers showing him ahead of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in support from evangelical voters in Iowa.
Cruz has spent recent weeks questioning Trump's conservative credentials and suggesting that Trump's ""New York values"" are not aligned with the conservative views of Iowan Republican primary voters.
Trump fired back as he has in recent days, calling Cruz ""really a nasty person.""
""I question Ted Cruz. I question him very (strongly),"" Trump said when asked about Cruz challenging Trump's values.
Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who will join Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio on the campaign trail in Iowa this week, also asked this week whether Trump had repented for his marital infidelities.
""I think everybody knows about me,"" Trump said simply, adding later that bringing that up was a ""cheap shot.""
Flanked by Maricopa County Sherriff Joe Arpaio, who gained notoriety for his hardline policies aimed at undocumented immigrants, Trump did offer some additional details on his pledge to build a wall on the U.S.'s southern border and deport all undocumented immigrants living in the United States.
Trump first said he would ""get Congress's approval"" before implementing those policies, before adding that he ""would at least speak to Congress."" 
Trump also touted his plan to deal with illegal immigration as the ""toughest"" of the presidential candidates.
During the press conference, Trump also announced he was likely to skip Thursday's GOP debate due to a deepening fight with the XXX News Channel. 
Afterward, Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Trump's decision on the debate was final.
""Mr. Trump will not be participating in the XXX News debate on Thursday night. It's not under negotiation,"" he said. ",8.8,8.7,62.68,0.0,CNN
