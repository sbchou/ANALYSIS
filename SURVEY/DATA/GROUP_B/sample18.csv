13,13,1348,Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders and Fans Embrace Tune of ‘America’ in Ad Free of Attacks,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-and-fans-embrace-tune-of-america-in-ad-free-of-attacks.html,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,9.1,9.2,"For a blissful minute, the cacophony of political ads on Iowa television sets vanishes altogether. No speeches, no slurs, only the warm harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel singing “America” can be heard, as down-to-earth Iowa landscapes and scenes of daily life accompany the famous song, in a new ad from Senator Bernie Sanders with the same title.

Iowa farmers (including a small child not much bigger than the calf he carries) and city dwellers give way to mostly young people jubilantly flocking to attend his rallies. An expanding grid overtakes the screen, showing the faces of thousands of people who made online donations to Mr. Sanders’s campaign.

A nontraditional offering from a decidedly nontraditional candidate, the ad earned a great deal of news coverage, without saying a word about Mr. Sanders, his platform or his chief opponent, Hillary Clinton.

The ad actually said plenty about how Mr. Sanders views the Democratic presidential contest. As politicians often say but seldom get across so viscerally, the election is ultimately about the voters. By turning over the microphone to Simon and Garfunkel, and aiming the camera not at Mr. Sanders so much as at Iowans generally and his admirers specifically, the ad tries to convey that “what Bernie Sanders is building is a movement in America,” explained Tad Devine, his senior strategist.

Though the ad placed minorities front and center in several shots, David Brock, who runs Correct the Record, a Clinton-aligned group, said the many views of Mr. Sanders’s large crowds showed that his following was overwhelmingly white. “From this ad, it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Brock told XXX. The statement received a harsh rebuke from the Sanders campaign, which recalled Mr. Brock’s early career as a conservative author, calling him a onetime “right-wing extremist.”

The ad, created by Devine Mulvey Longabaugh, has a vastly different feel from anything else seen in the race since Mrs. Clinton announced her candidacy in a hope-filled two-minute video in April 2015. It strikingly contrasts with Mrs. Clinton’s own minute-long closing argument to Iowans, replete with grave warnings and bold promises. And it is likely to stand out amid the clutter of attack ads and boasts from candidates and their allies in both parties.

Changing channels…

Senator Marco Rubio’s campaign is the first to turn a celebrity endorsement into a television ad, with Rick Harrison, the host of the reality show “Pawn Stars.” Saying he can detect a fraud, Mr. Harrison assures viewers: “When this guy walked into my shop, I knew he was the real deal.”

Most presidential campaigns distill their national message into 30 seconds and plop it between newscasts in the early states. But the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz is focusing on a hyperlocal issue, with a spot that has the look and feel of an ad for a House candidate, not a leading presidential contender: promising to protect Fort Jackson in Columbia, S.C., from thousands of job cuts.

Right to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, came up with an inventive way to make sure its 15-minute video was viewed: by putting it in the mail, not in the form of a DVD but with a video mailer. The mailers, with glossy screens the size of an iPad Mini, arrived in the mailboxes of supporters the campaign considers influential, and the video, the length of a documentary short, began to play as soon as the package was opened.

41 different presidential advertisements ran on Tuesday alone in various markets.

$22 MILLION has been spent in the campaign so far on advertising attacking Mr. Rubio.

$4.8 MILLION in ad time has already been reserved by Right to Rise in Texas, where Republicans vote on March 1.",9.2,9.1,61.67,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders
73,73,1148,First Draft: Major Donors to Clinton Include Napster Co-Founder,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/14/major-donors-to-clinton-include-napster-co-founder/,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,10.3,9.2,"Sean Parker, the youthful billionaire and co-founder of the music-sharing service Napster, gave nearly $300,000 to a joint fund-raising committee for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and dozens of state Democratic parties, federal filings show. 

Mr. Parker was one of several donors in recent months to give to the Hillary Victory Fund. Others include the media mogul Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl, and the billionaire trader and philanthropist George Soros; all gave more than $300,000. The Chicago-based entrepreneur J.B. Pritzker gave more than $350,000. 

The latter donors have been long familiar to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Parker, by contrast, is relatively new to the world of political giving, having only become a donor in the last several years. He has held meetings with politicians as disparate as Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. He gave to President Obama’s re-election effort in 2012 and also to the immigration reform group FWD.us. 

In the joint fund-raising entities, the Clinton campaign has asked major donors to consider giving money, because they face a number of options for gifts to the Democratic candidate that exceed $2,700, the maximum contribution allowed in the primary campaign. One is Priorities USA, the “super PAC”  supporting Mrs. Clinton, which just invested more than $4.5 million in trying to help her in the primary fight against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 

The joint fund-raising committee sends $34,500 of a donor’s contribution to the Democratic National Committee and spreads the rest among 33 different state party organizations.",9.2,10.3,53.21,0.0,The New York Times,Hillary Clinton

The rising pace of fund-raising puts the group, Priorities USA Action, in a stronger early position than any Democratic super PAC before it, in an election cycle where Republican outside groups are expected to spend heavily to help the party’s eventual nominee reclaim the White House. All told, the group has raised almost $51 million in the 2016 election cycle.

In addition to the money raised, donors have committed to providing at least $42 million in additional contributions, officials said. Those pledges would allow the group to exceed its total fund-raising for the 2012 cycle, when Priorities was formed to help President Obama win re-election. As of Friday, the group had almost $45 million in cash on hand.

“We have raised significantly more resources than at this point in 2012, built a team of our Party’s strongest leaders and activists, and are developing cutting-edge strategies to reach Democratic and undecided voters in every battleground state,” Guy Cecil, the group’s co-chairman, said in a memorandum obtained by XXX.

While full details of Priorities’ fund-raising will not be available until the super PAC files its official fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission this weekend, Mr. Cecil’s memorandum said the group had raised money from several labor unions that are backing Mrs. Clinton, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Laborers’ International Union of North America.

A person with knowledge of the group’s fund-raising said the organization had also secured large donations or commitments from a number of wealthy individuals, including James Simons, a New York hedge fund founder, and Danny Abraham, a Florida entrepreneur.

While Mrs. Clinton remains locked in the polls with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire, Priorities has so far banked most of its money for an expected general election campaign. The group’s spending for the 2016 cycle includes just $444,961 on independent expenditures as of Friday, most of it defending Mrs. Clinton from Republican attacks or promoting Mrs. Clinton’s positions.",12.0,13.0,46.1,0.0,The New York Times,Hillary Clinton
104,104,608,"Taking Note: Trump vs. Pope, Round 2",http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/trump-vs-pope-round-2/,trump,nyt,Immigration,8.7,10.0,"The headlines are blazing, Twitter is lit up, the political press is all hot for the kind of story it loves to tell: two huge celebrities attacking each other.

My first impulse on hearing that Pope Francis was calling out Donald Trump personally for his noxious views about immigrants and border walls was to quietly rest my head on my keyboard. It’s always wonderful to see a bully confronted — the bigger the bully, the better — but it was hard to see any good coming of this. Personal attacks are Mr. Trump’s weapon of choice, not the Pope’s, and anyone could have predicted what happened next: Trump struck back with indignant fury, and his people revenge-tweeted about the walls surrounding Vatican City.

For solace and perspective, I went to find out what America, the level-headed Jesuit magazine, was saying. Its article has a slightly longer quotation than The Times has (italics added): “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.”

That is an important line. Pope Francis leads the universal Catholic Church, so he is a pretty good authority on what is or is not in the Gospel — the New Testament, the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.

Odds are you have a pretty good idea yourself, at least enough to spot which of these two sets of quotations is bona-fide scripture.

A.

“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”

“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.”

“I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”

B.

“They’re bringing crime. They’re bringing drugs. They’re rapists.”

“These are people that shouldn’t be in our country. They flow in like water.”

“Nobody can build a fence like me.”

Scripture-quoting is a tricky proposition; show any Bible-thumper a passage to prove a point and he will immediately thump you back with something seemingly contradictory.

But it’s fair to say that the core of Christian teaching is not “Don’t be a loser.” It’s “Love your neighbor as yourself.”

I have little expectation that today’s episode will lead to any enlightening discussion. But I can at least pray that it might lead to more challenging, probing questioning of the candidates — the Republicans, I mean, who are so quick to lead with their Christian faith, and to summon the blessings of God upon their political endeavors.

Because there is so much dissonance when the G.O.P. does its holy-rolling thing. There are so many questions.

How can Ted Cruz begin a rally by invoking the Lord, and then speak as though he is running for war criminal? What do his Christian audiences think when he calls for the indiscriminate bombing of Muslim civilians, and laughs about making sand “glow in the dark” — basically a joke about mass murder?

Why does someone like Marco Rubio tell heart-warming stories about his immigrant roots, and then, with equal conviction, insist that he will pull up the ladder for more recent, non-qualified immigrant families, the ones his primary voters hate and fear?

Why has the entire Republican field treated immigrants and refugees, even dead Syrian children washed ashore on a beach, not as victims deserving welcome, but as threats to be shunned?

Why are immigrants who cross burning deserts to provide for their children, who stand on street corners to take any available job, but not handouts, who embody Republican ideals of faith and family, so hated by the God-and-country crowd?

Why, with their strong faith and the full might of America to protect them, do the Republican candidates sound so frightened and angry?

A Christian, by definition, believes Jesus is God, who dwelled among us, who was born poor, who preached a Gospel of love, and — though he surely could have annihilated the Romans and blasted his persecutors and made the sands of Galilee glow in the dark — allowed himself to be put to death by the authorities.

Why is that peaceful Christ never present in Republican speeches?

A Christian is also someone who sees the essential dignity and worth of other human beings. That would have to include immigrants and refugees, those who live and work here without papers, or who are trying to migrate to the United States, who are uprooted by poverty and war. Those who are being murdered by drug traffickers. Who are victims of crime. Who are raped.

I’ll give the last words to Gerard Manley Hopkins, the Victorian poet with the radical style who was a Jesuit, like Pope Francis, and who wrote vividly about God’s presence in the world — and in the people — around us:

I say more: the just man justices;
Keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;
Acts in God’s eye what in God’s eye he is –
Christ – for Christ plays in ten thousand places,
Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his
To the Father through the features of men’s faces.",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump
110,110,401,Jerry Falwell backs Donald Trump: Satire is dead (Opinion),http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/opinions/falwell-endorses-trump-balmer/index.html,trump,cnn,Immigration,11.5,10.4,"Randall Balmer, chair of the Religion Department and director of the Society of Fellows at Dartmouth College, is the author of more than a dozen books, including ""Redeemer: The Life of Jimmy Carter."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (XXX)  When the Nobel committee conferred its Peace Prize on Henry Kissinger in 1973, singer-songwriter and essayist Tom Lehrer declared that satire had become obsolete. 
How could the committee possibly bestow its highest honor on someone who, in collusion with Richard Nixon, had expanded military operations in Vietnam to Laos and Cambodia at the cost of thousands of lives?  
If satire had somehow managed to make any comeback in the four-plus decades since the Nobel-Kissinger debacle, it suffered another crippling blow on Tuesday when Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed Donald Trump for president. You can't make this up.
Falwell's father and namesake was one of the architects of the Religious Right in the late 1970s, arguing that politically conservative evangelicals should be active in the pursuit of ""biblical values"" in the arena of politics. Although Falwell's politics were misguided -- he mobilized politically to defend the tax-exempt status of his own Liberty Christian Academy and other so-called segregation academies -- the elder Falwell, at times at least, upheld the pretense that his political agenda was shaped by the principles set forth in the Bible, even as he led evangelicals away from their historical concern for the poor, for women and minorities and into the maw of right-wing politics.
His son and successor as head of Liberty University has abandoned all pretense that biblical values inform his politics. The younger Falwell, however, is very much like his father in one crucial respect: He clearly is more interested in political influence than scriptural principles. 
In his endorsement, Falwell Jr. did not anoint Trump as the most righteous candidate; that distinction would probably go to Bernie Sanders, a self-described secular Jew who calls out moneyed interests with the passion of the Hebrew prophets. Falwell, however, hailed Trump as ""a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again."" 
Trump is on his third marriage. Whether or not he qualifies as a ""wonderful father"" is not for me to judge, although he has eerily suggested that, were she not his daughter, he'd consider dating Ivanka Trump (his daughter). Similarly, in 1980, Jerry Falwell Sr., while proclaiming his support for ""family values,"" embraced the divorced and remarried Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter.
And what about biblical values, which are supposed to be at the core of the Religious Right? Jesus was emphatic that his followers busy themselves with caring for people on the margins, a concern that does not appear to be animating the Trump campaign. Jesus described those who would be admitted into the kingdom of heaven as those who demonstrated acts of kindness toward people in need. Those gestures would be reckoned as though they were directed to Jesus himself: ""For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."" 
Jesus spent his entire earthly ministry with outcasts, healing the sick and the lame,while Trump regularly makes fun of people he labels ""losers.""  Whereas Jesus was especially gracious toward children and women, Trump, on the other hand, derides women as ""pigs,"" ""dogs,"" ""slobs,"" ""bimbos"" and ""disgusting animals."" He characterized many Mexican immigrants as ""killers and rapists""  and said nothing as supporters suggested setting a protester at one of his rallies on fire.  Although he tried later to deny it, Trump mocked a journalist for his disability.  
Jesus, by contrast, preached love for one's neighbor. He instructed his followers to care for ""the least of these,"" to look after widows and orphans and to welcome the stranger. 
In the midst of his effusive endorsement, the younger Falwell failed to explain how Trump's construction of a wall on our southern border or his plan for massive deportations lined up with those biblical principles. 
Jerry Falwell Jr.'s backing of Donald Trump demonstrates that the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree. The elder Falwell's 1980 embrace of Reagan over Carter, an evangelical Sunday school teacher, represented the triumph of political opportunism over biblical principles. His son's endorsement of Trump looks much the same.
Satire is dead.
