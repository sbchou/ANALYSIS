13,13,1348,Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders and Fans Embrace Tune of ‘America’ in Ad Free of Attacks,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-and-fans-embrace-tune-of-america-in-ad-free-of-attacks.html,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,9.1,9.2,"For a blissful minute, the cacophony of political ads on Iowa television sets vanishes altogether. No speeches, no slurs, only the warm harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel singing “America” can be heard, as down-to-earth Iowa landscapes and scenes of daily life accompany the famous song, in a new ad from Senator Bernie Sanders with the same title.

Iowa farmers (including a small child not much bigger than the calf he carries) and city dwellers give way to mostly young people jubilantly flocking to attend his rallies. An expanding grid overtakes the screen, showing the faces of thousands of people who made online donations to Mr. Sanders’s campaign.

A nontraditional offering from a decidedly nontraditional candidate, the ad earned a great deal of news coverage, without saying a word about Mr. Sanders, his platform or his chief opponent, Hillary Clinton.

The ad actually said plenty about how Mr. Sanders views the Democratic presidential contest. As politicians often say but seldom get across so viscerally, the election is ultimately about the voters. By turning over the microphone to Simon and Garfunkel, and aiming the camera not at Mr. Sanders so much as at Iowans generally and his admirers specifically, the ad tries to convey that “what Bernie Sanders is building is a movement in America,” explained Tad Devine, his senior strategist.

Though the ad placed minorities front and center in several shots, David Brock, who runs Correct the Record, a Clinton-aligned group, said the many views of Mr. Sanders’s large crowds showed that his following was overwhelmingly white. “From this ad, it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Brock told XXX. The statement received a harsh rebuke from the Sanders campaign, which recalled Mr. Brock’s early career as a conservative author, calling him a onetime “right-wing extremist.”

The ad, created by Devine Mulvey Longabaugh, has a vastly different feel from anything else seen in the race since Mrs. Clinton announced her candidacy in a hope-filled two-minute video in April 2015. It strikingly contrasts with Mrs. Clinton’s own minute-long closing argument to Iowans, replete with grave warnings and bold promises. And it is likely to stand out amid the clutter of attack ads and boasts from candidates and their allies in both parties.

Changing channels…

Senator Marco Rubio’s campaign is the first to turn a celebrity endorsement into a television ad, with Rick Harrison, the host of the reality show “Pawn Stars.” Saying he can detect a fraud, Mr. Harrison assures viewers: “When this guy walked into my shop, I knew he was the real deal.”

Most presidential campaigns distill their national message into 30 seconds and plop it between newscasts in the early states. But the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz is focusing on a hyperlocal issue, with a spot that has the look and feel of an ad for a House candidate, not a leading presidential contender: promising to protect Fort Jackson in Columbia, S.C., from thousands of job cuts.

Right to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, came up with an inventive way to make sure its 15-minute video was viewed: by putting it in the mail, not in the form of a DVD but with a video mailer. The mailers, with glossy screens the size of an iPad Mini, arrived in the mailboxes of supporters the campaign considers influential, and the video, the length of a documentary short, began to play as soon as the package was opened.

41 different presidential advertisements ran on Tuesday alone in various markets.

$22 MILLION has been spent in the campaign so far on advertising attacking Mr. Rubio.

$4.8 MILLION in ad time has already been reserved by Right to Rise in Texas, where Republicans vote on March 1.",9.2,9.1,61.67,0.0,The New York Times

Before about 1,000 people packed into a Des Moines church, Sanders said that while he works closely with President Barack Obama, ""I do not agree with him on his policy toward deportation."" And O'Malley bemoaned the timing of the raids, stating that ""Jesus himself was a refugee child.""
Both candidates had previously criticized the raids, which first became public when The Washington Post published a story about the plans just before Christmas.
The White House defended the policies Friday. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said the raids reflected the administration's top priorities for deportation  people with criminal convictions and people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. But critics said the searches were ill-timed and disruptive for families.
Offering support for comprehensive immigration reform at the Putting Families First Presidential Forum, Sanders and O'Malley also slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump over his statements about Muslims. O'Malley, a former governor of Maryland, called Trump an ""immigrant-bashing carnival barker.""
Sanders, a U.S. senator for Vermont, said he would ""do everything I can to stand up to the Donald Trumps of the world and their bigotry and their xenophobia.""
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads the polls in the leadoff caucus state, with Sanders coming in second and O'Malley lagging far behind.  Clinton did not attend the forum.
In a statement released after the plan became public, Clinton spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said Clinton ""believes the United States should give refuge to people fleeing persecution. ... She believes we should not be conducting large-scale raids and roundups that sow fear and division in our communities.""
Clinton has campaigned heavily in Iowa, but some in the crowd of liberal activists were not pleased that she did not join them. At one point some people began to chant ""Where is Clinton?""
Sanders and O'Malley both offered a variety of proposals to support the middle class. O'Malley pledged to increase federal investment in transportation and affordable housing. Sanders said he'd like to see basic banking services offered at post offices to help people avoid predatory lending.",8.8,11.1,45.76,0.0,the Associated Press
37,37,1775,Cuomo: New Yorkers Not ‘Judgmental’ Like Cruz,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/15/cuomo-new-yorkers-not-judgmental-like-cruz/,cruz,wsj,Abortion,6.0,7.2,"Sen. Ted Cruz’s attack on “ New York values” has attracted the ire of a prominent New Yorker: Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
In three TV interviews on Friday, the morning after the most recent GOP presidential debate, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, excoriated Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, for his comments the previous evening.
“We’re not judgmental, negative and hostile, the way Cruz was,” Mr. Cuomo told NY1. “In one, 30-second sound-bite, he was offensive to gays, he was offensive to women, he offended 18 million New Yorkers — one of the largest Congressional delegations, by the way, in the country.”
A Cruz spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Cruz has criticized Donald Trump for embodying  “New York values.” During the debate, he was asked about what he meant by that. He said: “Everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.”
“I guess I can frame it another way,” he added: “Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying.”
Mr. Trump responded by noting conservative giant William F. Buckley was a New Yorker and cited the resilience of New Yorkers following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
In the NY1 interview, Mr. Cuomo, along with describing Mr. Cruz’s remarks as designed to “spread fear,” said they were inaccurate: “We have a significant conservative party and movement in New York. About 30% of New Yorkers will tell you they are conservatives. Trust me,” he said, “I deal with them every day.”
Mr. Cuomo also pegged Mr. Cruz as a hypocrite for having fundraised in New York, which the senator has done on numerous occasions. “I’m sure Ted Cruz was very negative about New York money,” the governor said, mockingly. “I’m sure he’s not going to accept any money from any New Yorker. I’m sure if he has, he’s going to return all of those contributions.”
Added Mr. Cuomo: “I’m always open to give him an education on what New York values are all about. And if he had any class, he would apologize to the people of New York — not that I believe they need it, or they want it. But if he had any class, he would apologize.”
Aside from NY1, Mr. Cuomo also appeared on XXX and XXX.
The governor wasn’t the only New York official to pounce on Mr. Cruz. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that he was “disgusted” by the senator’s remarks.
Said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat: “I find myself, for once, in agreement with Donald Trump. I think it was right for Donald Trump to defend New York City, and to talk about the heroic actions of the people of this city after 9/11.”",6.8,5.6,76.22,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal
52,52,1716,Cruz failed to disclose Goldman loan during Senate run,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/WsD1UYfsiQY/cruz-failed-to-disclose-goldman-loan-during-senate-run.html,cruz,fox,Campaign Finance,10.7,9.6,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz failed to disclose on federal fundraising reports that he relied on $1 million in loans to help finance his 2012 Senate campaign.
The borrowed money included a sum from Goldman Sachs, where his wife, Heidi Cruz, is an employee.
The Texas senator's 2016 campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier called the failure to report those loans on fundraising documents, as required, a ""mistake."" She said Wednesday that the campaign is seeking guidance from federal regulators on how to update the old reports.
Cruz learned he should have disclosed the loans as part of his fundraising from a XXX reporter, who published a story on the matter late Wednesday. The Times described the loans as totaling as much as $1 million from Goldman and Citibank and said they were paid down in late 2012. Frazier did not dispute those details.
Frazier said Cruz has made no secret of the loans, pointing to their disclosure later in separate personal financial reports required of all federal elected officials.
Yet Cruz has never mentioned the loans on the 2016 campaign trail. Instead, he has said that he and his wife liquidated ""our entire net worth"" to finance his underdog Senate bid.",9.6,10.7,52.19,0.0,Fox News
99,99,222,"First Draft: At Rally in Rivals’ Home State, Donald Trump Boasts of Florida Jobs Record",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/13/at-rally-in-rivals-home-state-donald-trump-boasts-of-florida-jobs-record/,trump,nyt,Immigration,5.6,6.8,"TAMPA, Fla. — With Florida’s March 15 primary looming, Donald J. Trump drew another of his massive crowds Friday night in Tampa, where he boasted of his résumé as a developer and job creator in Florida. 

It was a preview of the argument he will no doubt use to strip support from the state’s two home-grown candidates, Jeb Bush, the former governor, and Senator Marco Rubio.

“I’ve spent a lot of money in Florida, nobody else has,’’ Mr. Trump said. “I’ve created tremendous numbers of jobs down here.’’

He spoke of properties he developed in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties and emphasized that many of the workers were Hispanic, an effort to mitigate his harsh stance against illegal immigration.    

“The Hispanics love me,’’ Mr. Trump maintained.  “And by the way, by the way, by the way, today I just settled with Univision. They’re happy. I’m happy.’’ (On Thursday, Mr. Trump settled a suit with the Spanish-language network over its decision last year to drop Trump beauty pageants after his comments that Mexican migrants included rapists and other criminals.)     

When someone shouted “Jorge Ramos,’’ the Univision anchor Mr. Trump once ejected from a news conference for pressing him on immigration, Mr. Trump said he now planned to do an interview with Mr. Ramos.

Mr. Trump recounted a long tale that he said he had never publicly told, about buying the Doral golf resort near Miami in 2012. He told of driving down the $170 million price he agreed to even after signing a contract. “I said listen fellas, ‘I’m not going to pay 170,’’’ he said. “’The place is in lousy condition. I’m not paying it.  You defrauded me.’’’

The sellers responded, in Mr. Trump’s telling, “No way!’’ and threatened to find another buyer.

Mr. Trump’s response: he would tie up the deal in court for years. “Anyway, after about four minutes we agreed to take $20 million off,’’ he crowed. “I paid $150 million.  For four minutes work, I save $20 million.’’

The moral of the story was clear: As president, Mr. Trump would bring the same art-of-the deal prowess to negotiations with foreign countries.  “For me this is fun,’’ he said.  “It’s a game.  For John Kerry, it’s work.  It’s labor.  Look at the deal he made with Iran.’’

Pointing to the Doral purchase, he said,  “That’s the way we should be doing it with our country, right?’’  He did not mention that the PGA said last year it would explore moving a tournament from the Doral after Mr. Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the country. 

Before  the rally, which about 10,000 attended on the campus of South Florida University,  Trump supporters said they saw value in the country being run by a business tycoon.

 “The Carnegies, the Mellons all built this country up,’’ said Terri Peavy, who works in real estate in Tampa.  “Even though they were robber barons, they provided the foundation.’’

In response to rivals’ criticism that Mr. Trump lacks governing experience, Kathy Simonelli, an administrative assistant from Fort Myers, said:  “I think he’s seasoned as a businessman. He’s someone worldly and knows how to deal with people.’’

A large part of Mr. Trump’s political success is driven by voters who find his experiences equal, and in many cases superior, to time in elected office.   “Politicians, the establishment, everything is so broke,’’ Ms. Simonelli said.  “You get somebody like Trump that says I’ll make America great again – it sounds like a fairy tale.  But that’s where we’re at.  We’ll try him.’’",6.8,5.6,76.22,0.0,The New York Times
