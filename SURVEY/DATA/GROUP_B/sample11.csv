60,60,1107,Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright’s Exhortation to Women to Back Clinton,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/06/critics-pounce-on-madeleine-albrights-exhortation-to-women-to-back-clinton/,clinton,wsj,Campaign Finance,6.0,7.2,"CONCORD, N.H.  Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered a warning to young women who arent inclined to elect Hillary Clinton the first female president.
Just remember, Ms. Albright told the crowd at a get-out-the-vote rally for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Theres a special place in hell for women who dont help each other.
The familiar phrase was a hit in the room, drawing cheers from Mrs. Clintons supporters. But online, the reaction was much different.
Played in short video clips online or quoted in tweets, the quote almost sounded like a threat to other women: help Hillary Clinton or else.
Some on social media asked if they should also be helping the other woman in the 2016 race, former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina. Others expressed surprise at the idea that a women should be forced to vote for a woman — instead of being free to chose based on issues. And some on Twitter took it a step further, with references to Bill Clinton’s history with women during his time in the White House.
@madeleine I’m a good woman! But apparently I have a special place in hell? Thanks-but My God can decide that. #SetBackToWomen #FeelTheBern

But, Ms. Albright, who served in the Clinton administration was quoting herself. It’s from a speech she gave in 2006 as a keynote speaker. As backlash spread, Jesse Lehrich, Mrs. Clinton’s rapid response director, tweeted “peeps freaking out about that Madeleine Albright quote: It’s not new — it was literally on a Starbucks cup.”
Nick Merrill, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, pointed out on Twitter that Ms. Albright had said this “literally hundreds of times.”
With only three days remaining until New Hampshires primary, Mrs. Clinton deployed some of her high-profile supporters, including Ms. Albright and Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), during a busy day on the campaign trail.
In Concord, Ms. Albright shared stories of working with Mrs. Clinton during her eight years as first lady. And Ms. Albright made a forceful push for making history by electing a woman to the countrys highest office.
People are talking about revolution, so what kind of a revolution would it be to have the first woman president of the United States? Ms. Albright said, referring to Sen. Bernie Sanderss call for a political revolution.
In an effort to reach the young people the Clinton campaign is aiming to attract from its rival, the campaign advertised the event on the Students for Bernie Sanders subreddit group on the website Reddit and streamed it online on Facebook and received more than 100,000 views.
Ms. Albright said some young women dont understand the importance of supporting Mrs. Clinton, adding that theres more work to be done to break gender barriers.
Its not done, and you have to help, Ms. Albright said. Hillary Clinton will always be there for you.",6.8,5.6,76.22,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal,Hillary Clinton
63,63,1189,Hillary Clinton Sharpens Focus After Democratic Debate Tussles,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-sharpens-focus-after-democratic-debate-tussles.html,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,7.6,7.6,"After a debate performance in which she painted Bernie Sanders as a fringe candidate whose policies bordered on fantasy, Hillary Clinton and her allies intensified the pressure on the Vermont senator on Friday, burnishing her embrace of President Obama and seeking to solidify her support among blacks.

Following a stinging loss in New Hampshire this week, the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, the “super PAC” that supports her, have sharpened their focus on Mr. Sanders and the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Separately, they have invested in new rounds of advertising intended to blunt any momentum that Mr. Sanders might have gained from his landslide in New Hampshire.

On Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s team unveiled a new television ad that ties her to Mr. Obama on the issue of tightening gun laws — a perceived weakness of Mr. Sanders. It features the Rev. Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed in the Charleston church shooting, praising Mrs. Clinton for “standing with the president” on firearms restrictions.

Despite the fact that Mrs. Clinton has led in most South Carolina polls, Priorities USA is also leaving nothing to chance there. The group announced on Friday that it is starting its largest advertising campaign to date on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf, investing $500,000 to spread the message on radio stations that the former secretary of state is the true heir to Mr. Obama’s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.

“We need a president who will build on all that President Obama has done,” say the narrators of the ad, which will air in South Carolina communities with large black populations. “President Obama trusted Hillary Clinton to be America’s secretary of state. And we know Hillary Clinton has the vision and courage to help build an economy to support our communities.”

Mrs. Clinton is building on the lines of attack she used in Thursday’s Democratic debate in Milwaukee. She criticized Mr. Sanders for disparaging Mr. Obama’s record and accused him of being too narrowly focused on his central mission of breaking up the banks to be sufficiently concerned about issues such as civil rights and criminal justice reform.

The new push from Priorities USA could leave Mrs. Clinton open to more criticism from the Vermont senator, who has lamented her reliance on big donors as a sign that she is not independent. At the debate, Mrs. Clinton tried to separate herself from the group while also clinging to Mr. Obama.

“You’re referring to a super PAC that we don’t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me,” Mrs. Clinton said in response to a question about what rich donors expect when they give money to political action committees. “They are the ones who should respond to any questions.”

A spokesman for Priorities USA pointed out that super PACs support Mr. Sanders, even though he opposes them. Priorities USA is also spending $4.5 million across the South to turn out voters before several states there hold nominating contests on March 1.

In the days leading to the South Carolina voting, Mr. Sanders could also be looking for some new answers to tough questions, as Mrs. Clinton took a more aggressive approach to discrediting his foreign policy knowledge and credentials. In one of her more stinging debate blows, Mrs. Clinton said it was not clear to her who Mr. Sanders was seeking counsel from on international affairs.

Asked to note any advisers, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, pointed to an essay published on the Politico magazine website on Thursday by Lawrence Korb, an assistant secretary of defense during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Although Mr. Korb has only met with Mr. Sanders once, he said he is “serious” on foreign policy.

“In my dealings with him, and in analyzing his record in Congress over the past 25 years, I have found that Sanders has taken balanced, realistic positions on many of the most critical foreign policy issues facing the country,” Mr. Korb wrote.

As the Democrats jockey for position, Republicans, who hold their next presidential debate on Saturday, also have South Carolina on their minds. With their primary election being held a week earlier, on Feb. 20, the sniping among the remaining candidates has reached a fever pitch.

On Friday, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will gather at the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. They will look to court the evangelical Christians that could be crucial to their success in the state.

Donald J. Trump is not attending the event, but as he faces a tight race with Mr. Cruz in South Carolina, he made sure to weigh in from afar. In a post on Twitter, he rebutted a suggestion made by the Texas senator that Mr. Trump agrees with Mr. Obama on same-sex marriage.

“How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” Mr. Trump said.",7.6,7.6,65.73,0.0,The New York Times,Hillary Clinton
68,68,1250,Pro-Clinton Super PAC Announces Large Fundraising Haul,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/29/pro-clinton-super-pac-announces-large-fundraising-haul/,clinton,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.4,8.4,"The main super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said  it is sitting on a war chest of $44.7 million in cash following strong fundraising in the second half of the year, and has lined up tens of millions of dollars in additional commitments, giving Mrs. Clinton a financial advantage as primary season begins.
The super PAC, Priorities USA Action, said it raised a total of $40.95 million in full-year 2015, and has raised another $9.6 million in January, making its total raised at $50.6 million. The group said it has another $42 million in fundraising commitments, or pledges from its donors to contribute funds in the future.  The numbers were disclosed in a memo from the group’s chief strategist, Guy Cecil.
Separate from the super PAC, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has raised $112 million, making her likely the best-funded candidate in the race.   Mrs. Clinton’s primary challenger in the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders, has seen his fundraising accelerate in recent months, bringing in a haul of $75 million for full-year 2015. But the Vermont senator does not have an allied super PAC–though that doesn’t mean outside groups haven’t spent money on his behalf.
On the Republican side, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush‘s super PAC was by far the wealthiest as of the most recent filing in July, when it said it had raised $103 million. But Mr. Bush has struggled to raise money for his campaign, raising just $25 million through September, the most recent figures it has reported.
Most other candidates have not yet reported their latest fundraising figures, which include money raised and cash on hand. Campaigns have to file their fourth-quarter numbers by Sunday night, while super PAC file their second-half reports.
In a memo, Mr. Cecil warned that Republicans’ attacks against Mrs. Clinton will continue, noting that GOP groups have already spent $6 million against her. “They are preparing a billion-dollar campaign to deceive and distort her record for months on end,” Mr. Cecil wrote. “Priorities USA sees it as our responsibility to fight back early and often.”
Mr. Cecil also highlighted support the group had received from labor unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the UA Political Education Committee and the International Union of Operating Engineers. Mr. Sanders has also been popular among labor unions.
Among Priorities top donors in the first half the year were a slew of billionaires, including financier Donald Sussman, global investor George Soros and media magnate Haim Saban. The group has not yet reported its donors for the second half of the year. The deadline to do so is midnight on Sunday.",8.0,8.0,64.71,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal,Hillary Clinton

(XXX)  Allies of Hillary Clinton are forming a new $25 million political organization aimed at expanding voter protection efforts and driving turnout and registration among Latino and black voters essential to her Democratic presidential campaign.
The new group, Every Citizen Counts, is beginning its work as Clinton faces a stronger-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose overwhelming victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary has set off new worries among Democrats that Sanders may soon cut into Clinton's advantage with black and Hispanic voters.
The non-partisan organization will focus on legislation, litigation, voter registration and turnout among black and Latino communities in the general election. It was formed in August and has recently begun developing partnerships with other organizations to expand voter education, registration, protection and turnout.
Clinton has made voter registration and protection a major part of her agenda with minority voters and her campaign and is planning a significant push in the aftermath of her New Hampshire loss to win minority voters in the two remaining February contests in Nevada and South Carolina and a slew of Southern states holding contests in early March.
The group will operate as a nonprofit ""social welfare"" organization, allowing it to take unlimited donations and keep its donors' identities private. Organizers said it would not be involved in the Democratic primaries and would be focused on November's election and beyond.
Clinton said Tuesday night that both she and Sanders wanted to eliminate unaccounted money from politics. But the group's acceptance of private donations will likely draw scorn from Sanders and his allies, who have made the elimination of big, secret money in politics a pillar of his campaign.
During his victory speech in New Hampshire, Sanders said the Clinton team had already thrown everything but the kitchen sink at his  and warned, ""I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well.""
Every Citizen Counts will be advised by Guy Cecil, a former aide to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who currently leads Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC supporting Clinton's bid. Cecil said he will continue in his current role as chief strategist at Priorities USA and other political work.
An early leader in the group will be Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who has endorsed Clinton's campaign and will be a prominent supporter for her in Georgia's ""Super Tuesday"" primary on March 1.
Reed said in a statement that the organization would be a ""powerful ally to those who want to make registration and voting easier and fairer. This is at the heart of what it means to be an American.""
Sanders' allies will likely see the group's role differently. When Priorities USA announced its recent fundraising haul of $50 million through January, Sanders repeatedly told supporters that he had raised ""zero dollars"" for super PACs.
Every Citizen Counts is expected to have a budget of at least $25 million, according to a presentation given to potential donors. Among its goals will be expanding voting access in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin.
The group already has a partnership with the National Democratic Voting Rights Trust, which has been involved in voting rights litigation in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Ohio. The trust is advised by prominent campaign lawyer Marc Elias, who serves as general counsel for Clinton's presidential campaign.
Slides in a presentation provided to XXX estimates that the group's litigation would protect the right to vote for 2 million voters in those four states, which will be among the most contested in the November election.
Cecil, who will serve as the organization's senior adviser, said he is putting together a team and advisory board that will oversee the group. He said the group was not aimed solely on the 2016 election but would be ""in this fight for the long haul.""
""There have been too many efforts to restrict access to the polls, making it even more difficult to vote,"" he said. ""We will engage at all levels: pushing for stronger legislation around early voting, same-day registration and vote by mail, waging legal battles to roll back onerous laws and registering voters in underrepresented communities across the country.” ",12.0,13.0,46.1,0.0,the Associated Press,Hillary Clinton
109,109,129,"Donald Trump, Despite Impieties, Wins Hearts of Evangelical Voters",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/donald-trump-despite-impieties-wins-hearts-of-evangelical-voters.html,trump,nyt,Abortion,8.7,8.8,"OKLAHOMA CITY —  It is one of the prime paradoxes of the 2016 election: A twice-divorced candidate who has flaunted his adultery, praised Planned Parenthood and admitted to never asking for God’s forgiveness is the favorite of the Christian right.

The candidate, Donald J. Trump, who won with evangelical voters in South Carolina and has their support in other Bible Belt states that will vote in primaries on Tuesday, has dominated the Republican campaign by appealing to the economically disenfranchised. But the promise of a Trump presidency that would gall the political elites is also resonating with the culturally disenfranchised, including many conservative Christians.

Mr. Trump’s success with evangelicals, who constitute the largest Republican blocs in six Southern states voting on Tuesday, poses a mortal threat to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose campaign is built on these voters. Mr. Cruz will face nearly insurmountable odds if he fails to carry more than his home state on Super Tuesday, with the race afterward moving to less favorable territory.

Mr. Trump’s appeal with the religious right is debunking some long-held maxims about evangelical voters, showing that they are not monolithic; that they do not fall neatly in step with evangelical leaders, many of whom endorsed Mr. Cruz; and that within evangelical ranks lie fault lines of class and culture.

“Social conservatives are taking a look at Trump and saying he’s not with me on all these issues, but the overall larger imperative for us is to tear down this system that has not served us for a very long time,” said Gregg Keller, a former executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which was founded by the Christian conservative Ralph Reed.

In speeches, including one in Oklahoma City on Friday, Mr. Trump almost never talks about issues that politicians seeking evangelical support thunder about: abortion, religious liberty and, recently, the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice.

Practically the only part of a Trump stump speech aimed at faith-driven voters is a promise that shopkeepers will again be able to say Merry Christmas. It is one of his most reliable applause lines.

Mr. Trump is winning with evangelicals, as he does with other Republican primary voters, by promising uncompromising immigration and trade policies and a hard-driving leadership style. “Evangelicals see all that’s going down, and they just like somebody to be strong and stern and consistent on issues,” said J. Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and onetime Baptist pastor, before Mr. Huckabee quit the race.

A CBS News poll of Republican primary voters nationally this month showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz among evangelicals 33 percent to 22 percent.

In South Carolina, where Mr. Trump won a commanding victory, earning all 50 delegates, he carried evangelicals by six percentage points over Mr. Cruz and 11 percentage points over Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to exit polls.

After Mr. Cruz’s brutal South Carolina loss, his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, re-emphasized a Southern strategy, the cornerstone of Mr. Cruz’s campaign since he announced he was running. “We’re going to have a big night on March 1 in an electoral map that favors us,” Mr. Roe said.

But even though Mr. Cruz won a plurality of evangelicals in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, he faces uncertain prospects in Oklahoma and other Bible Belt states that will vote on Tuesday. Polls show him trailing Mr. Trump in Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama.

“Not everybody is going to follow just because we say this is what we suggest you do,” said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa who is a national co-chairman of the Cruz campaign.

He expressed frustration that so-called values voters were giving Mr. Trump a pass on issues about his character, such as his mocking of women, as well as his conservative credentials. Mr. Vander Plaats suggested that they were “either hypocritical or uninformed or maybe not interested.”

“It’s not just three marriages,” he said, listing what he called Mr. Trump’s breaks from conservatism. They included donating to Democrats in the past and once suggesting that his sister, a federal judge who struck down a ban on partial-birth abortions in New Jersey, could make a good Supreme Court justice.

“I understand why you’re ticked off at your government,” Mr. Vander Plaats said of evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump. “But if that’s your one rational reason for casting a vote, then I think you lack discernment, judgment and temperament.”

The emergence of Christian conservatives as a force in Republican politics traces to the Moral Majority movement of the 1970s led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who helped put Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush into office. But the older generation has lost political clout, failing to see its favorites win the Republican nomination in recent presidential cycles, while the American mainstream has embraced same-sex marriage and a more secular culture.

Mr. Falwell’s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., now the president of Liberty University, where Mr. Trump called a book in the Bible “Two Corinthians” instead of the more accepted “Second Corinthians” in a speech, has endorsed the billionaire. He cited Mr. Trump’s business record and the strength he projects.

“All the social issues — traditional family values, abortion — are moot if ISIS blows up some of our cities or if the borders are not fortified,” he said, referring to the Islamic State. “Rank-and-file evangelicals are smarter than many of the leaders. They are trying to save the country and maybe vote on social issues next time.”

That sentiment is echoed by many grass-roots Trump supporters who identify as evangelical, though they may not be regular churchgoers.

“You’re voting for a president; you’re not necessarily voting for a pastor,” said Less McNiff, a retired human resources executive who heard Mr. Trump address thousands at the Oklahoma City rally on Friday. “He’s not necessarily orthodox, but I like the fact that he’s strong.”

Linda Sharp, an elementary school music teacher from Moore, Okla., who attended the rally and plans to vote for Mr. Trump, said, “He’s made moral choices that are not stellar, but I lay that against his business plan or the economic growth for America, and I choose that.”

But her husband, Phillip Sharp, who is pastor of Heavenly Heights Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, cautioned those who would argue, like the younger Mr. Falwell, that voters should choose a strong leader rather than a pious one.

“I’m sure the Nazis would have said the same thing,” said Mr. Sharp, who favored Mr. Cruz. “You’ve got to be careful when somebody’s trying to make you great.”

Some Trump supporters seem to wrestle aloud with the seeming contradiction between how their faith guides them and their hopes for a Trump presidency.

“I don’t know that Trump is the person to bring God back into our country, but I think if we don’t we’ll have much bigger problems,” said Renae Ehler, an insurance saleswoman from Davenport, Okla., who planned to vote for Mr. Trump. “The business part of things, I think, is going to make a big difference.”

Paul Smith, a machinist in Oklahoma City, called himself a “total Christian” but said he did not attend a church because “I’ve witnessed too much hypocrisy” in churches. “I’ve been with Donald Trump since he put his hat in the race,” he said. “Basically he’s anti-establishment.”",8.8,8.7,62.68,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump
