17,17,1487,First Draft: F.E.C. Tells Sanders Campaign That Some Donors May Have Given Too Much,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/12/f-e-c-tells-sanders-campaign-that-some-donors-may-have-given-too-much/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,9.1,8.0,"The Federal Election Commission has asked the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to re-examine contributions from more than a hundred donors who appear to have given more than the legally permissible amount.

The vast majority of the donors gave several small contributions to Mr. Sanders for the Democratic primary that eventually totaled more than the $2,700 limit, according to a letter the election commission sent to Mr. Sanders on Thursday. 

Such glitches are common in political campaigns, which are required to track small donors and begin itemizing their contributions when their total reaches $200. That can be harder when donors use slightly different variations of their names or contribute from more than one address. Mr. Sanders’s campaign may choose to refund the excess contributions or re-designate the excess for use in a general election campaign, when candidates can accept another $2,700.

But the F.E.C.’s review suggests that the sheer volume of small contributions Mr. Sanders is receiving — more than 3 million of them so far, according to his campaign — may be straining his campaign’s ability to keep track of which donors are which. Most of the contributions cited by the commission were given by donors with relatively unusual names, whose small checks are generally easier to tally.

In early February, after the end of the fourth fund-raising quarter, Mr. Sanders’s campaign announced that it had more than 1.3 million donors, an astonishing number for so early in the campaign cycle. And last week, the campaign announced it had received 3.25 million total donations, the most of any presidential candidate in the race. The campaign’s most recent F.E.C. filing was nearly 100,000 pages long.

In an e-mail, Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said, “We are looking into the F.E.C. staff questions and are committed to full and accurate disclosure of the tremendous grass-roots support for Sen. Sanders from people all across America.”",8.0,9.1,56.25,0.0,The New York Times
59,59,1766,Cruz to tea party supporters: Don't get 'burned' by fake conservatives,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/ted-cruz-tea-party-rally-donald-trump-marco-rubio/index.html,cruz,cnn,Immigration,12.3,12.4,"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (XXX) Ted Cruz implored a Tea Party audience here on Saturday to examine closely the record of candidates like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, warning a crowd not to get ""burned"" by fake brothers in arms even as he declined to utter his rivals' names.
The Texas senator typically asks audiences to distinguish between ""campaign conservatives"" and ""consistent conservatives,"" but Cruz's remarks Saturday were essentially a dare to those gathered here to look finely at opponents' histories on seven key battles. In a retooled stump speech flush with Trump overtones and delivered right before Trump took the stage himself, Cruz offered a checklist of fights that he had led that his opponents -- like Trump -- hadn't.
 
""How many people here have been burned by politicians?"" Cruz asked the crowd, hours after Cruz bashed Trump's record as more liberal than conservative. ""The stakes in 2016 have never been higher. Our country is hanging in the balance. So I've got a very simple question for the folks here: How do we not get burned again?""
Cruz then listed off seven fights he had led, describing each as a ""time for choosing,"" a reference to Ronald Reagan's iconic 1964 speech: fighting for gun rights, traditional marriage, defunding Planned Parenthood, fighting against Obamacare, a nuclear Iran, ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants and government intervention for Wall Street and other favored industries.
""If someone tells you they're tea party, you can't be tea party and at the same time have supported TARP,"" Cruz said, using an acronym for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a controversial Wall Street bailout program. ""You can't be tea party and at the same time have supported Barack Obama's stimulus. You cant be tea party and at the same time support the ethanol mandate because it's good politics in Iowa and support the sugar subsidies because it's good politics in Florida.""
Trump is one of several candidates who support the Iowa ethanol mandate, and Rubio has advocated for his home state's subsidies. Cruz made sure to knock Republican candidates like Rubio who Cruz sees as insufficiently tough on immigration -- which is also one of Trump's signature issues.
""Anybody who was AWOL from the battle on the Gang of Eight has no standing as a candidate now to say they will enforce the border,"" Cruz said of the comprehensive immigration bill pushed by Rubio in 2013.
Trump, for his part, backed off from his criticisms of Cruz that he had broadcast loudly all day on Saturday. During a 45-minute speech here, Trump left Cruz unscathed until the very end, when he mentioned the loans that Cruz received as a Senate candidate in 2012 but did not properly report to election authorities.
 
And when Trump did finally mention Cruz's name, he appeared rattled after the tea party crowd loudly booed him. 
""You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want,"" he said, the boos beginning. ""He's got bank loans from Goldman Sachs, he's got bank loans from Citibank -- and then he acts like Robin Hood?""
Cruz, who suddenly has started criticizing Trump after seven months of refusing to do so, essentially offered South Carolina voters a roadmap to vet him. 
""When someone announces as a Republican candidate for president, suddenly they agree with the values of everyone in this room,"" Cruz said. ""If they haven't been willing to stand and lead, you can know to an absolute fact they wouldn't do so as president either.""",12.0,11.9,54.56,-0.4,CNN

The ad, titled ""Valentía"" (which means ""courage"" or ""bravery"" in English) is the campaign's first Spanish-language ad in the Silver State and casts Clinton as a friend of Latinos at a time when Republican candidates are talking about deportation and denying undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship.
""There is no other candidate who has fought as hard for our families as Hillary Clinton,"" a narrator says in Spanish. ""She stands with us to achieve immigration reform and to keep families together.""
The TV ad opens with a shot of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, two Republicans who have been outspoken about strict immigration standards, and the narrator says, ""It's when things get tough that you see the friends by your side.""
""There is still much to do, but with a friend like Hillary, we keep moving forward,"" the narrator concludes.
Nevada's caucuses, the first in the West, are on February 23. There has been a dearth of polling in the state, but surveys from late last year had Clinton up by double digits over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN
104,104,608,"Taking Note: Trump vs. Pope, Round 2",http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/trump-vs-pope-round-2/,trump,nyt,Immigration,8.7,10.0,"The headlines are blazing, Twitter is lit up, the political press is all hot for the kind of story it loves to tell: two huge celebrities attacking each other.

My first impulse on hearing that Pope Francis was calling out Donald Trump personally for his noxious views about immigrants and border walls was to quietly rest my head on my keyboard. It’s always wonderful to see a bully confronted — the bigger the bully, the better — but it was hard to see any good coming of this. Personal attacks are Mr. Trump’s weapon of choice, not the Pope’s, and anyone could have predicted what happened next: Trump struck back with indignant fury, and his people revenge-tweeted about the walls surrounding Vatican City.

For solace and perspective, I went to find out what America, the level-headed Jesuit magazine, was saying. Its article has a slightly longer quotation than The Times has (italics added): “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.”

That is an important line. Pope Francis leads the universal Catholic Church, so he is a pretty good authority on what is or is not in the Gospel — the New Testament, the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.

Odds are you have a pretty good idea yourself, at least enough to spot which of these two sets of quotations is bona-fide scripture.

A.

“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”

“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.”

“I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”

B.

“They’re bringing crime. They’re bringing drugs. They’re rapists.”

“These are people that shouldn’t be in our country. They flow in like water.”

“Nobody can build a fence like me.”

Scripture-quoting is a tricky proposition; show any Bible-thumper a passage to prove a point and he will immediately thump you back with something seemingly contradictory.

But it’s fair to say that the core of Christian teaching is not “Don’t be a loser.” It’s “Love your neighbor as yourself.”

I have little expectation that today’s episode will lead to any enlightening discussion. But I can at least pray that it might lead to more challenging, probing questioning of the candidates — the Republicans, I mean, who are so quick to lead with their Christian faith, and to summon the blessings of God upon their political endeavors.

Because there is so much dissonance when the G.O.P. does its holy-rolling thing. There are so many questions.

How can Ted Cruz begin a rally by invoking the Lord, and then speak as though he is running for war criminal? What do his Christian audiences think when he calls for the indiscriminate bombing of Muslim civilians, and laughs about making sand “glow in the dark” — basically a joke about mass murder?

Why does someone like Marco Rubio tell heart-warming stories about his immigrant roots, and then, with equal conviction, insist that he will pull up the ladder for more recent, non-qualified immigrant families, the ones his primary voters hate and fear?

Why has the entire Republican field treated immigrants and refugees, even dead Syrian children washed ashore on a beach, not as victims deserving welcome, but as threats to be shunned?

Why are immigrants who cross burning deserts to provide for their children, who stand on street corners to take any available job, but not handouts, who embody Republican ideals of faith and family, so hated by the God-and-country crowd?

Why, with their strong faith and the full might of America to protect them, do the Republican candidates sound so frightened and angry?

A Christian, by definition, believes Jesus is God, who dwelled among us, who was born poor, who preached a Gospel of love, and — though he surely could have annihilated the Romans and blasted his persecutors and made the sands of Galilee glow in the dark — allowed himself to be put to death by the authorities.

Why is that peaceful Christ never present in Republican speeches?

A Christian is also someone who sees the essential dignity and worth of other human beings. That would have to include immigrants and refugees, those who live and work here without papers, or who are trying to migrate to the United States, who are uprooted by poverty and war. Those who are being murdered by drug traffickers. Who are victims of crime. Who are raped.

I’ll give the last words to Gerard Manley Hopkins, the Victorian poet with the radical style who was a Jesuit, like Pope Francis, and who wrote vividly about God’s presence in the world — and in the people — around us:

I say more: the just man justices;
Keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;
Acts in God’s eye what in God’s eye he is –
Christ – for Christ plays in ten thousand places,
Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his
To the Father through the features of men’s faces.",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,The New York Times
105,105,631,The 2016 Race: How to Understand Donald Trump’s Defeat in Iowa,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/upshot/how-to-understand-donald-trumps-defeat-in-iowa.html,trump,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.7,8.8,"For months, mainstream Republicans have hoped that Donald Trump’s support was a mirage — a combination of high name recognition, unsustainable news media coverage and support from irregular voters who might not show up in a primary.

Tonight, there’s reason to believe their hopes just might be well founded. Despite leading each of the last 10 Iowa polls, by an average of seven percentage points, Donald Trump was defeated by Ted Cruz, who currently leads, 28 percent to 24 percent, with 97 percent of precincts reporting in the Iowa caucuses. Marco Rubio is in a strong third place with 23 percent of the vote.

In the end, Mr. Trump came closer to taking third than to winning.

The result doesn’t necessarily leave us much closer to knowing who the eventual nominee will be. It probably signals the beginning of a protracted, three-way fight for the nomination. But the loss raises the possibility that Mr. Trump’s strength is at least partly an illusion; he may not be quite as strong as he looks.

Mr. Trump’s defeat won’t necessarily derail his campaign, as some have speculated. He leads by a wide margin in polling in New Hampshire, so he’ll have a strong opportunity to rebound.

Mr. Trump’s voters also appeared to turn out in large numbers. Many speculated that he might fail to turn out his supporters, but the turnout in Iowa was higher than most analysts had forecast, with 167,000 votes counted as of now — swamping the 122,000 votes from 2012.

Yet Mr. Trump still fell short. He lost among voters who decided over the last month by a wide margin, and he took third place among voters who had previously participated in the caucuses. Mr. Trump fared especially poorly among voters who decided over the last week — since his decision not to participate in the final presidential debate before the caucuses.

For Mr. Cruz, the victory gives him a chance to forge a narrow but real path to the nomination. His strengths include strong support from self-described “very conservative” voters; perhaps the best organization in the race; and a strong fund-raising apparatus. He could fare relatively well in South Carolina in a few weeks, and across the South on Super Tuesday.

But his path to the nomination is still not an easy one. He will face full-throated opposition from many prominent Republicans, as was the case here in Iowa. And Mr. Cruz’s narrow victory was not especially impressive. It depended almost exclusively on strength among “very conservative” voters, who are vastly overrepresented in the Iowa caucuses. There was no primary state where “very conservative” voters represented a larger share of the electorate in 2012 than they did in Iowa.

He won just 19 percent among “somewhat conservative” voters and a mere 9 percent of the “moderate” vote.

Mr. Cruz’s victory may bestow enough momentum to attract less conservative voters. But recent primary contests offer reason to be cautious about his prospects. Candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum never succeeded in broadening their appeal beyond their natural bases after winning Iowa, and Mr. Cruz will probably fall short of the nomination if he also cannot do so.

Making it even harder for Mr. Cruz to broaden his appeal is Mr. Rubio. He finished in a strong third place, beating pre-election polls and nearly beating Mr. Trump for second in a state where Mr. Cruz’s base is at its strongest.

Whether Mr. Rubio’s showing will be enough to change the race in New Hampshire is hard to say — there isn’t much precedent for a logjam like the one we have in New Hampshire. Four mainstream conservative candidates — John Kasich, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and Mr. Rubio — have all been clustered near 10 percent of the vote in New Hampshire surveys.

If Mr. Rubio’s performance in Iowa bestows enough media coverage and credibility for him to break the deadlock, it would be a crucial turning point in the race. A strong Rubio showing in New Hampshire could push several mainstream candidates out, freeing up endorsements and fund-raising dollars that have sat on the sidelines. It would also allow him to consolidate the voters who have supported the mainstream candidates.

It would bring about a true three-way race heading into South Carolina.",8.8,8.7,62.68,0.0,The New York Times
