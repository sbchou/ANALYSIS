8,8,1477,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Promises to Keep Pressing the Campaign,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-promises-to-keep-pressing-the-campaign/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.7,10.0,"BOSTON — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed on Monday night that no matter the outcome of the Super Tuesday races, his campaign would continue to rally voters against a political establishment that is largely backing his rival, Hillary Clinton.

Mr. Sanders, standing next to a chartered plane here, said he would “likely” win Vermont’s vote, and also felt good about his chances for winning the most delegates in Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts. He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.

“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”

Mr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. 

“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”

Still, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.

“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote. They do that very well.”

Mr. Sanders went on to repeat criticisms of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to several industries and to cast himself as a candidate more interested in reforming campaign finance laws and dealing with income inequality. To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay’s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for “The Big Short,” a movie about the failure of the banking industry.

“As Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. 

Mr. Sanders also said that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he didn’t think “real change” comes from someone taking money from such industries and that instead, such change would come from millions of people demanding “a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent.”",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,The New York Times
19,19,1590,Sanders surpasses 2015 fundraising goal with sizable haul,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/02/politics/bernie-sanders-fundraising-hillary-clinton/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,9.9,10.0,"Amherst, Massachusetts (XXX) Bernie Sanders raised $33 million in the final three months of 2015, his campaign said in a statement Saturday, failing to outraise Hillary Clinton but smashing the goal aides set when the Vermont senator launched his campaign back in May.
Sanders' haul -- which brings his 2015 total to $73 million -- was almost exclusively buoyed by his prodigious online fundraising operation. Aides told XXX that Sanders received over 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.
Clinton's campaign announced Friday that it raised $37 million for the primary campaign in the last three months of 2015, easily surpassing the $100 million goal the campaign had set earlier in the year.
""This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,"" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement on Saturday. ""What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support. We are making history and we are proud of it."" 
The final quarter of 2015 also saw Sanders dramatically increase his spending. According to aides, the campaign ended 2015 with $28.4 million cash on hand. That is only $2 million more than the $26.2 million the campaign had in the bank at the end of the third quarter of 2015, meaning Sanders' operation spent the bulk of what they raised in the fourth quarter.
Much of that spending, according to aides, was focused on building infrastructure in early primary states, including deploying organizers to South Carolina and Nevada, and building the campaign's already existing organization in Iowa and New Hampshire.
For the year, Sanders' campaign spent 61% of the money it brought in.
 
Sanders has long been a formidable fundraiser with deep roots in online and small donor fundraising, but even some of his closest aides were unsure he could raise the money needed to run a presidential campaign when the launched earlier this year. Tad Devine, his top strategist, said that the operation had hoped to bring in between $40 and $50 million by the end of 2015.
Sanders smashed that goal, but in a dramatically different way than Clinton did.
A bulk of Clinton's haul came from fundraisers she or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, personally headlined. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. And the former president headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter.
According to XXX's analysis, fundraisers personally headlined by Clinton brought in at least $22 million in the forth quarter.
Sanders, however, only headlined two fundraisers in the last three months of 2015, bringing his year total to nine, while Clinton's total for the year was 174.
What's more, almost all of Sanders' donors have yet to reach the $2,700 max donation, according to aides, who said Saturday that only around 600 Sanders supporters have maxed out.
That means Sanders' campaign can continue to hit up their donors for small donations as the primary calendar moves along.
Sanders' campaign has also raised big money at notable moments in the fourth quarter. Sanders' aides bragged that the campaign raised $2.5 million in the two days after the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas.
And the day after the campaign breached the Clinton campaign's voter data -- and subsequently sued the Democratic National Committee -- aides said the campaign raised more than $1 million.",9.6,9.5,60.65,-0.4,CNN

118,118,3,2nd former Mexican president unloads on Donald Trump,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/6fZtc76vZuA/2nd-former-mexican-president-unloads-on-donald-trump.html,trump,fox,Immigration,14.6,13.6,"MEXICO CITY –  Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday joined his predecessor in office in unloading on Donald Trump, calling the Republican front-runner's campaign racist and saying his discourse on immigration is fueling anti-American sentiment around the world.
Calderon, a conservative who was president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, even said he thought Trump was trying to exploit the same social feelings and resentments as did Adolf Hitler.
""I think his logic of exalting white supremacy isn't even acting against immigration — Donald Trump is the descendant of migrants — it is acting and speaking against immigrants who have a different skin color than him, which is frankly racist and is a bit like the exploitation of sensitive fibers that Hitler did in his day,"" Calderon told reporters after a meeting of the National Action Party, or PAN, in Mexico City.
Calderon's comments parallel those made earlier by former President Vicente XXX, who preceded Calderon in office and also belonged to the PAN party.
In interviews with Univision and Mexican media, XXX called Trump ""crazy,"" a ""false prophet"" and an embarrassment to his party. When asked about Trump's assertion that he was going to get Mexico to pay for his proposed border wall, XXX used an explicative to make his point the country would never do so.
Trump said XXX ought to be ""ashamed of himself"" for his vulgarity and demanded an apology.
Trump has angered many Mexicans for his campaign rhetoric denigrating some immigrants as ""rapists"" who bring crime and drugs to the United States. Threats of mass deportations of Mexicans and other migrants illegally in the country, along with his promise to build a wall separating the nations, have added to the bad feelings.
Calderon said Trump's discourse is ""sowing hate"" against the United States around the world and this is not is Washington's interest.
During a visit to Mexico's capital, Vice President Joe Biden apologized for the inflammatory rhetoric about Mexico in the U.S. presidential campaign.
""Some of the rhetoric coming from some of the presidential candidates on the other team are I think dangerous, damaging and incredibly ill-advised,"" Biden said on Thursday. ""But here's what I'm here to tell you: They do not, they do not, they do not represent the view of the vast majority of the American people.""",13.6,14.6,42.04,0.0,Fox News
