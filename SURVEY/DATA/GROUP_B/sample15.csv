22,22,1482,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Tells Volunteers in Reno to Expect Victory in Nevada,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/13/bernie-sanders-tells-volunteers-in-reno-to-expect-victory-in-nevada/,sanders,nyt,Immigration,10.7,10.8,"RENO, Nev. —  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont told hundreds of volunteers gathered here on Saturday that his strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were not flukes.

“We surprised them in Iowa,” Mr. Sanders said to cheers. “We surprised them in New Hampshire. We are going to surprise them here in Nevada.”

While Mr. Sanders was expected to beat Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, his 22-percentage point margin was still a resounding victory and one he hoped gives him a tailwind heading into next Saturday’s Democratic caucuses in Nevada. 

He is hoping a win here will convince voters nationwide that he has broad appeal and can garner support from a more diverse electorate than in Iowa and New Hampshire, two predominantly white states. Mr. Sanders on Saturday focused his remarks on economic inequality, campaign finance reform and Wall Street regulation, topics at the core of his candidacy.

“People of Nevada know what Wall Street’s greed, irresponsibility, recklessness, and illegal behavior did,” Mr. Sanders said. “They did it all over this country but maybe no place more profoundly in terms of wrecking lives, than right here in Nevada.”

The senator also spoke to the crowd of 519 people about the importance of immigration reform and said he understands that many undocumented people are living in fear and need substantive legislation from the next president.

“Today, we have 11 million people in this country who are undocumented,” Mr. Sanders said. “I have met people throughout this campaign, young people with tears running down their cheeks, who are literally worried that they or their parents will be deported tomorrow, that they will be separated from their loved ones. Count me in as somebody who will lead the effort for comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.”

Mr. Sanders added that if  “Congress does not do the job that it is supposed to do, then we will use the executive powers of the White House.” 

The senator also touted his immigrant roots Saturday, reminding his volunteers that he grew up watching his family struggle financially.

“My dad came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket from Poland, couldn’t speak English, never made much money,” Mr. Sanders said. “But he was as proud an American as you have ever seen because he saw what America gave to him and his kids, the kind of freedom and opportunity it gave.”

Later, at a forum in Reno, he took questions from the crowd, including one about how he would help “indigenous people,” or Native Americans.

“I have always stood with the oppressed people of this country and there are no people who have been more oppressed than the indigenous people of this country,” he said. “I will stand with you and do everything I can to bring dignity and respect and economic opportunity to those people who do not have it today.”

Mr. Sanders also hugged a woman who told him she was undocumented and feared she would be deported. “I will do everything that I humanely can to make sure you do not continue to live in fear,” he said.

He also reminded the crowd that he had voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law signed by President Bill Clinton that barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage, and which was largely overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013.",10.8,10.7,57.61,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders

He is less likely to speak the country’s official language.

But inside a pub teeming with supporters here, including a small group of Spanish speakers, Mr. Cruz could not resist a stab at the language that competitors like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeb Bush speak much more readily. (Mr. Cruz has appraised his own Spanish as “lousy.”) 

 “Qué bueno!” he said, turning to the group’s members as he took questions from the crowd. “De dónde?”

 They said they, too, had Cuban roots.

 “O.K., you guys are in trouble,” he said, to laughs. “There’re too many Cubans in the room.”

 Mr. Cruz was two days into a five-day bus tour through the state, amid an increasingly heated contest with Donald J. Trump. Among other issues, the two have tussled over Mr. Cruz’s slight that Mr. Trump embodied “New York values.”

 On this point, one of the Spanish speakers seemed to have Mr. Cruz’s back.

 “I’m a conservative from New York City,” she said.

 “Fantastic!” Mr. Cruz said. ",6.4,4.0,85.69,0.0,The New York Times,Ted Cruz

On the question of foreign policy, the Texas senator is ""just as wrong as Obama, if not worse,"" Graham told XXX's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
""In Ted Cruz's world, dictators do very well,"" he continued, comparing his colleague's foreign policy to that of Ron Paul, the former congressman, Republican presidential candidate and long-time leading libertarian. 
Asked why his fellow senators are reputed to have such a distaste for Cruz, Graham accused the winner of the Iowa GOP caucuses of being an ""opportunist"" to his core -- one who ""gets ahead at our expense"" and will ""run down other Republicans"" to advance his own ambitions.
Not that Graham -- who has endorsed Jeb Bush -- is warming to Donald Trump, whose foreign policy prescriptions he described as ""gibberish.""
""I don't know if anybody's worse than Trump,"" Graham told Blitzer, rolling out a familiar burn: ""If you're a Republican and your choice is Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in a general election,"" he said, ""it's the difference between poisoned or shot -- you're still dead.""
What about a potential independent run by Michael Bloomberg?
Graham rejected the billionaire former New York City mayor -- who is considering a third-party run for president -- out of hand. 
""I'm gonna support the Republican nominee,"" Graham said, and if it's Trump or Cruz, ""I'm gonna buy a ticket on the Titanic.""
Asked who, of the three highest-finishing GOP candidates in Iowa, he preferred, Graham chose Marco Rubio.
""Marco,"" he said, ""has a worldview consistent with reason and reality versus the other two.""

97,97,177,Donald Trump Shifts to Small and Intimate From Big and Brash,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/08/donald-trump-shifts-to-small-and-intimate-from-big-and-brash/,trump,wsj,Foreign Policy/National Security,5.6,6.8,"SALEM, N.H.Republican Donald Trump set aside the blaring soundtrack and stadium lights typical of his campaign rallies for the most intimate voter forum his presidential campaign has held yet.
Speaking in the round here Monday morning, Mr. Trump refrained from announcing his latest poll numbers and making a long speech. He instead took far more questions from the audience than is typical.
I love these things even more than making a speech, Mr. Trump said during the hour-long forum at the Derry-Salem Elks Lodge.
Mr. Trump is late to the town hall game, with other candidates holding dozens of the forums that New Hampshire voters come to expect of their presidential candidates. The businessman has said he can get his message out more effectively in large crowds. New Hampshire voters go to the polls Tuesday.
As is typical for his events, Mr. Trump kept up his attacks of Republican rival Jeb Bush, saying the former Florida governor has gotten little for the tens of millions of dollars his campaign has spent.
I dont want your money but you have to go out and vote tomorrow. We have to get rid of the Bushes of this world, Mr. Trump said to the crowd of roughly 200 attendees. They are weak, they are ineffective.
He also criticized the pharmaceutical lobby for having too much influence over politicians, and in a new twist, took aim at Bush campaign national finance chairman Woody Johnson. The Johnson & Johnson heir and New York Jets owner could influence Mr. Bushs health-care policy if elected and discourage him from requiring drug companies to lower prescription costs, Mr. Trump said.
A Bush campaign spokeswoman didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.
Several attendees prefaced their questions by saying they were voting for Mr. Trump, and the event was uncontroversial. One man asked Mr. Trump why he opposed Syrian refugees from coming to U.S. towns that welcome taking them in, pointing specifically to Greenwich, Conn.
I can look in their face and say they cant come, said Mr. Trump, a Greenwich property owner, to applause. We dont know where their parents come from.
The Trump campaign committed a candidate faux pas by not beginning the event with a pledge of allegiance per tradition, prompting one attendee to note it was missing. I like that. That was very nice, Mr. Trump said after it was recited.
Mr. Trump asked for votes to give him a mandate at the polls Tuesday. He also got nostalgic about his time in New Hampshire.
You drive through these beautiful areas, the trees on both sides and you want to go hiking, said Mr. Trump, who has pointed to golf as his main form of exercise.

99,99,222,"First Draft: At Rally in Rivals’ Home State, Donald Trump Boasts of Florida Jobs Record",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/13/at-rally-in-rivals-home-state-donald-trump-boasts-of-florida-jobs-record/,trump,nyt,Immigration,5.6,6.8,"TAMPA, Fla. — With Florida’s March 15 primary looming, Donald J. Trump drew another of his massive crowds Friday night in Tampa, where he boasted of his résumé as a developer and job creator in Florida. 

It was a preview of the argument he will no doubt use to strip support from the state’s two home-grown candidates, Jeb Bush, the former governor, and Senator Marco Rubio.

“I’ve spent a lot of money in Florida, nobody else has,’’ Mr. Trump said. “I’ve created tremendous numbers of jobs down here.’’

He spoke of properties he developed in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties and emphasized that many of the workers were Hispanic, an effort to mitigate his harsh stance against illegal immigration.    

“The Hispanics love me,’’ Mr. Trump maintained.  “And by the way, by the way, by the way, today I just settled with Univision. They’re happy. I’m happy.’’ (On Thursday, Mr. Trump settled a suit with the Spanish-language network over its decision last year to drop Trump beauty pageants after his comments that Mexican migrants included rapists and other criminals.)     

When someone shouted “Jorge Ramos,’’ the Univision anchor Mr. Trump once ejected from a news conference for pressing him on immigration, Mr. Trump said he now planned to do an interview with Mr. Ramos.

Mr. Trump recounted a long tale that he said he had never publicly told, about buying the Doral golf resort near Miami in 2012. He told of driving down the $170 million price he agreed to even after signing a contract. “I said listen fellas, ‘I’m not going to pay 170,’’’ he said. “’The place is in lousy condition. I’m not paying it.  You defrauded me.’’’

The sellers responded, in Mr. Trump’s telling, “No way!’’ and threatened to find another buyer.

Mr. Trump’s response: he would tie up the deal in court for years. “Anyway, after about four minutes we agreed to take $20 million off,’’ he crowed. “I paid $150 million.  For four minutes work, I save $20 million.’’

The moral of the story was clear: As president, Mr. Trump would bring the same art-of-the deal prowess to negotiations with foreign countries.  “For me this is fun,’’ he said.  “It’s a game.  For John Kerry, it’s work.  It’s labor.  Look at the deal he made with Iran.’’

Pointing to the Doral purchase, he said,  “That’s the way we should be doing it with our country, right?’’  He did not mention that the PGA said last year it would explore moving a tournament from the Doral after Mr. Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the country. 

Before  the rally, which about 10,000 attended on the campus of South Florida University,  Trump supporters said they saw value in the country being run by a business tycoon.

 “The Carnegies, the Mellons all built this country up,’’ said Terri Peavy, who works in real estate in Tampa.  “Even though they were robber barons, they provided the foundation.’’

In response to rivals’ criticism that Mr. Trump lacks governing experience, Kathy Simonelli, an administrative assistant from Fort Myers, said:  “I think he’s seasoned as a businessman. He’s someone worldly and knows how to deal with people.’’

A large part of Mr. Trump’s political success is driven by voters who find his experiences equal, and in many cases superior, to time in elected office.   “Politicians, the establishment, everything is so broke,’’ Ms. Simonelli said.  “You get somebody like Trump that says I’ll make America great again – it sounds like a fairy tale.  But that’s where we’re at.  We’ll try him.’’",6.8,5.6,76.22,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump
