35,35,1825,First Draft: Ted Cruz ‘Super PAC’ Invests Additional $2.5 Million in Advertising,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/19/ted-cruz-super-pac-invests-additional-2-5-million-in-advertising/,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,6.0,7.2,"A “super PAC” backing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican presidential race has invested an additional $2.5 million in television ad reservations in Iowa and South Carolina as the contest hurtles toward the first votes. 

The new ad reservations, which are in addition to $1 million that the group, Keep the Promise I, bought in those states and in New Hampshire, comes as Mr. Cruz finds himself under intense criticism from his rivals, including Donald J. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. 

The first spot, called “Record, not Rhetoric,” is a positive spot depicting Mr. Cruz as the only person in the wide G.O.P. field who will do what he says he will do and who has a record of taking on fights in Washington, a key part of the senator’s message to voters. 

“Ted Cruz is a top-tier contender facing vicious attacks designed to frighten voters rather than inform them. Voters have a reasonable expectation that leaders will have thought deeply and fought heartily long before campaign season. ‘Who can you trust?’ and ‘Who has been there?’ are the same question,” said Kellyanne Conway, the president of the super PAC. 

In a veiled knife-twist at his more vocal opponents like Mr. Trump and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Ms. Conway said that “a record – not rhetoric – shows who likes to fight for us, and who just likes to fight.”",7.2,6.0,75.2,0.0,The New York Times
48,48,1816,First Draft: Ted Cruz Outlines Plan to Strengthen Military,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/16/ted-cruz-outlines-plan-to-strengthen-military/,cruz,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,9.1,9.2,"MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas outlined his plans to strengthen the military in an address aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown on Tuesday, advocating what he called a “more tooth, less tail” approach.

In his speech on the World War II-era aircraft carrier, Mr. Cruz called for increasing the number of active duty forces to at least 1.4 million from 1.3 million, as well as improving the nation’s Air Force capabilities — to at least 6,000 planes, with a minimum of 1,500 tactical fighter aircraft, an increase from roughly 4,000 aircraft.

“Anything less creates a continuing training and readiness gap that risks the lives of the men and women who volunteer to serve this great nation,” he said. “At a time when our air superiority should be one of America’s great advantages, our ability to project power and obtain air superiority is tragically anemic.”

Mr. Cruz’s last-minute policy speech (the campaign announced it on Monday night) highlights how, days before Saturday’s Republican primary in South Carolina, he is trying to emphasize his national security credentials in a state in which veterans and members of the military make up large segments of the population. He is also pushing back against attacks by rivals who have cast him as weak on foreign policy and national defense.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has repeatedly attacked Mr. Cruz for refusing to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the military. And the Texas senator has also come under scrutiny for his decision to support the USA Freedom Act, compromise legislation that limited the National Security Agency’s ability to collect bulk metadata from phone records.

Mr. Cruz has said he voted against the defense authorization bills because they all contained language that would have allowed President Obama to indefinitely detain United States citizens without due process.

Though Mr. Cruz’s positions on national security — he is less hawkish than Mr. Rubio — helped him win over some supporters of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky — who dropped out of the presidential race — in New Hampshire, voters in South Carolina have typically gravitated toward candidates eager for a strong commander in chief.

In his address, Mr. Cruz criticized both Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, a secretary of state in the Obama administration, and seemed to try to strike a balance between promising to be tough on national defense by increasing the size of the nation’s fighting force, while also promising not to be to quick to intervene in conflicts around the globe. And he promised smarter spending on defense.

Mr. Cruz also weighed in on other issues — what to do with Syrian refuges, immigration and women in combat.

“We are not going to admit refugees into the United States who may have been infiltrated by ISIS terrorists,” he said, to applause. “We are not going to grant American citizenship to individuals who are here illegally.”

And, he added, “As the father of two daughters, I can tell you we are not going to draft American women into military combat.”

Mr. Cruz did not specifically explain how he would pay for his military expansion, but pointed to his spending plan, which he said would reduce the federal budget by $500 billion over 10 years, and also talked about reducing “waste, fraud and abuse” at the Pentagon.

“First, and foremost, we are not going to expand the bloated bureaucracy that is stifling progress and innovation at the Pentagon,” Mr. Cruz said.

Directly addressing his critics, Mr. Cruz said, “If you think it’s too expensive to defend this nation, try not defending it.”

He concluded by talking about the illustrious history of the U.S.S. Yorktown, and conjuring an image of a stronger America.

“Starting next year, our sailors won’t be on their knees with their hands on their heads,” Mr. Cruz said, referring to the 10 Navy sailors briefly detained by Iran last month after drifting into Iranian waters. “And our secretary of state will not be apologizing and thanking their Iranian captors.”

“Instead,” Mr. Cruz continued, “they will be standing on the decks of the mightiest ships the world has ever known with their heads held high, confident that the great country that they volunteered to serve has their back.”

Speaking to reporters after the event, Mr. Cruz couldn’t help but take aim at Donald J. Trump, his chief rival, who has threatened to sue him over his eligibility to run for president, because he was born in Canada.

“It seems that Donald is very rattled right now,” Mr. Cruz said. “He gets very upset and when he gets upset, he engages in insults.”",9.2,9.1,61.67,0.0,The New York Times
64,64,1298,"The Ad Campaign: In New Ad, Hillary Clinton Sums Up Her Case for Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/in-new-ad-hillary-clinton-sums-up-her-case-for-iowa-and-new-hampshire-democrats.html,clinton,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,7.9,9.2,"Packed with biography, campaign promises and attacks on her Republican rivals, a new 60-second ad from Hillary Clinton, titled “This House,” offers what sounds like her closing argument to Iowa Democrats, asking them to vote for her on Feb. 1. A similar ad with a different ending will be shown in New Hampshire.

Opening on the White House, the ad shows a sweltering industrial plant, a fighter taking off from an aircraft carrier and a family of four sitting down to dinner. “The person who lives here,” a male narrator intones, “has to solve problems as big as the world and as small as your kitchen table.”

Viewers are taken on a quick tour of Mrs. Clinton’s extended career in public service: surrounded by children as first lady, when she “helped get health care for eight million kids”; as a senator from New York, standing grim-faced in a trench coat amid the debris at ground zero, where, the ad says, she “helped a city rise again”; and speaking soberly to an attentive President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as the voice-over says she has “stared down hostile leaders around the world.” She is seen on the campaign trail and in the Situation Room with President Obama as the ad calls her the “one candidate for president who has everything it takes to do every part of the job.”

The ad rattles off Mrs. Clinton’s touchstone promises: to defend Social Security and Medicare against privatization, protect Planned Parenthood from shutdown, “take on the gun lobby” and “finally get equal pay for women.” Clips of a shouting Donald J. Trump and of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas aiming an assault weapon at a gun range symbolize the threat as the narrator says Mrs. Clinton will “stop the Republicans from ripping all our progress away.”

It closes with Mrs. Clinton, back in October, assuring Iowa Democrats, “I’m listening to you, I’m fighting for you, and with your support, I’m going to deliver,” as viewers are urged to “caucus for Hillary.”

An entire candidacy boiled down to a minute. With its heavy focus on foreign policy and experience in a crisis, the ad plays up ways in which Mrs. Clinton’s résumé compares favorably with that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her unnamed Democratic rival. The references to gun control offer a reminder of her recent attacks on Mr. Sanders’s record on that issue. And she returns to women’s rights, on which she began her campaign. To “keep America safe and build a stronger economy,” the ad sums up, “Hillary’s the choice.”

In 2008, Mrs. Clinton was criticized for what some saw as an overstatement of her role in enacting the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. But this ad gets it right: She was a driving force on the bill within her husband’s administration, aiding the efforts of Edward M. Kennedy and others who led the fight for it in the Senate.

Iowa broadcast markets.

It feels as if it’s much longer than 60 seconds, and that is a good thing: The ad seeks to give Mrs. Clinton’s strengths the feeling of overwhelming force while conveying that only she has what it takes to meet the demands of the presidency and to defend what Democrats hold dear.",9.2,7.9,70.13,0.0,The New York Times
68,68,1250,Pro-Clinton Super PAC Announces Large Fundraising Haul,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/29/pro-clinton-super-pac-announces-large-fundraising-haul/,clinton,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.4,8.4,"The main super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said  it is sitting on a war chest of $44.7 million in cash following strong fundraising in the second half of the year, and has lined up tens of millions of dollars in additional commitments, giving Mrs. Clinton a financial advantage as primary season begins.
The super PAC, Priorities USA Action, said it raised a total of $40.95 million in full-year 2015, and has raised another $9.6 million in January, making its total raised at $50.6 million. The group said it has another $42 million in fundraising commitments, or pledges from its donors to contribute funds in the future.  The numbers were disclosed in a memo from the group’s chief strategist, Guy Cecil.
Separate from the super PAC, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has raised $112 million, making her likely the best-funded candidate in the race.   Mrs. Clinton’s primary challenger in the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders, has seen his fundraising accelerate in recent months, bringing in a haul of $75 million for full-year 2015. But the Vermont senator does not have an allied super PAC–though that doesn’t mean outside groups haven’t spent money on his behalf.
On the Republican side, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush‘s super PAC was by far the wealthiest as of the most recent filing in July, when it said it had raised $103 million. But Mr. Bush has struggled to raise money for his campaign, raising just $25 million through September, the most recent figures it has reported.
Most other candidates have not yet reported their latest fundraising figures, which include money raised and cash on hand. Campaigns have to file their fourth-quarter numbers by Sunday night, while super PAC file their second-half reports.
In a memo, Mr. Cecil warned that Republicans’ attacks against Mrs. Clinton will continue, noting that GOP groups have already spent $6 million against her. “They are preparing a billion-dollar campaign to deceive and distort her record for months on end,” Mr. Cecil wrote. “Priorities USA sees it as our responsibility to fight back early and often.”
Mr. Cecil also highlighted support the group had received from labor unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the UA Political Education Committee and the International Union of Operating Engineers. Mr. Sanders has also been popular among labor unions.
Among Priorities top donors in the first half the year were a slew of billionaires, including financier Donald Sussman, global investor George Soros and media magnate Haim Saban. The group has not yet reported its donors for the second half of the year. The deadline to do so is midnight on Sunday.",8.0,8.0,64.71,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal
81,81,1176,Hillary Clinton hopes for strong Latino turnout in Nevada,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/nevada-caucus-democrats-2016/index.html,clinton,cnn,Immigration,13.0,12.0,"Las Vegas (XXX) Bracing for another close race in a state that was once viewed as her firewall, Hillary Clinton is counting on a strong turnout among Latino voters in the Nevada caucuses Saturday to hold off Bernie Sanders' momentum in this critical swing state.
With polling showing a dead heat between Clinton and Sanders among likely caucusgoers, Clinton's surrogates fanned out across the Silver State this week, attempting to portray her as the more trustworthy candidate for Latinos as they work to ramp up participation by her supporters in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County.
In the final days, Clinton's allies have slashed Sanders' immigration record, criticizing him as a ""johnny-come-lately"" to the issue who has been too vague about his plans. At the same time, they have continued their push for Clinton in Nevada's rural counties -- where Clinton's canvassers have been pressing the case that Sanders' proposals are unrealistic and unachievable in the current political climate.
A strong win would provide a jolt of momentum to Clinton heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.
A loss, or even another close finish with Sanders in Nevada, would further chip away at the aura of electability that once surrounded her path to the nomination, serving as a testament to the strength of Sanders' momentum even in a heavily Latino state where she was organized six months ahead of him. 
An estimated 40% of the state's Democratic voters are non-white -- and Clinton was expected to show her strength among minority voters with a good showing here. But Sanders has emphasized his family's immigrant roots here in ads and on the campaign trail, noting that his father was a Polish immigrant to America who originally spoke little English. 
""Immigration isn't just a word for Bernie Sanders,"" the narrator said in one Spanish-language radio ad for his campaign in November. ""His story is the immigrant story."" 
Beyond Clinton's breakneck campaign schedule here this week, there were other signs of concern within her campaign about the unexpected strength of the Sanders effort here.
On the same day that Clinton released an emotional immigration ad featuring Clinton talking to a tearful 10-year-old girl about the deportation letter that her parents received, her operatives added a half-million dollars to their ad spending on broadcast, satellite and cable for a total of $3.4 million to Sanders' $3.7 million, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising.
The Clinton campaign is also clearly looking at caucus states beyond Nevada, dispatching Bill Clinton to speak to voters in the upcoming contest of Colorado even as the post-caucus celebrations get underway in Nevada Saturday evening.
Clinton repeatedly dropped in on employees at the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in her efforts to boost Clark County turnout. Both campaigns had heavily courted the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which supported Obama in 2008 and helped him turn out voters to caucus. But in a blow to Clinton's campaign, they chose to stay neutral this year.
Still, the former secretary of state greeted workers from that union during an overnight stop at Caesar's Palace Thursday after flying in from Chicago. Both she and her husband will visit the caucus site -- which is aimed at making it easier for Strip shift workers to participate during their work day -- at Caesar's Palace on Saturday afternoon while the caucus is underway.   
""I know you do a hard job,"" she told Caesar's Palace housekeeping workers during her overnight visit to their linen room. She said that when she arrived at the hotel, she had asked herself: ""Who is still working?""
""A lot of people are,"" she said, before asking the workers to caucus for her at the hotel Saturday.
Like Obama in 2008, Sanders is counting on a strong turnout from first-time caucusgoers, though not nearly as many are expected as eight years ago when some 120,000 turned out.
Though Clinton is perceived as having an advantage with voters in Clark County, in part because of her strong support from labor unions, the Vermont senator spent a good amount of time campaigning around the populous areas of Las Vegas this week before heading to Elko, Nevada, on Friday to rally rural voters.
During both an XXX forum and a speech at the Clark County Democratic Dinner on Thursday night, Sanders made a direct pitch to Latinos by chiding Donald Trump for vilifying immigrants. He argued that Congress ""must move towards a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants.""
""While I understand that there are people who have differences of opinion with me on immigration reform, there is no justification, no reason, to resort to bigotry and xenophobia when we are talking about Mexicans or we are talking about Muslims,"" Sanders said at the Democratic dinner at the Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.
""People can disagree about immigration reform, but in the year 2016, we will not allow the Trumps and others to divide us up and appeal to racism, which has done this country so much harm for so many years,"" he said.
During the XXX/Telemundo forum, Sanders also defended his 2007 vote against legislation that would have revamped the immigration system, stating that he objected to guest-worker provisions that were described by one legal advocacy group as being ""akin to slavery.""  
Both Sanders and Clinton have also made an aggressive play for Nevada's rural voters this cycle. Clinton won the popular vote here in 2008. But by organizing in the delegate-rich rural counties of Nevada, Obama won more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Clinton.
Clinton is heavily organized in those rural counties this time. The looming question is whether her campaign will be able to overcome the enthusiasm for Sanders, as well as a palpable level of discomfort with her position on gun control compared to Sanders' more moderate stances. 
At a town hall in Elko Friday morning, Sanders stressed the importance of turnout among rural voters to his campaign, calling on them to show the world the desire for a ""political revolution that transforms this country.""
""I really believe this from my heart of hearts: obviously we are here to win and hope to win. I want democracy to flourish,"" the Vermont senator said. ""I hope Nevada turns out -- I hope we have a YUGE turnout -- I'm afraid to use that word! But I hope we have a very, very large voter turnout. Show the world that democracy is alive and well in Nevada.""
