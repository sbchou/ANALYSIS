4:45 p.m.
Donald Trump's closing pitch to Iowa caucus-goers is a family affair.
The GOP candidate's rarely-heard-from wife Melania has joined her husband at an afternoon rally after a visit to a local church.
She says her husband with be, ""unbelievable. The best deal-maker, the best master negotiator.""
Trump is also joined by his pregnant daughter Ivanka and her developer husband.
Trump says doctors advised Ivanka not to make the trip and joked about her potentially giving birth here.
""Wouldn't it be great if she had the baby in Iowa?"" he asks the crowd.
4:40 p.m.
Bernie Sanders is urging his supporters to help him make history and send a message to those who back establishment politics.
Kicking off his final day of campaigning in Waterloo, Sanders says the nation will be looking at whether Iowa is prepared to move the nation away from establishment politics and economics. He says Monday night could be a ""very historic night for this country. We can make history.""
The self-described ""democratic socialist"" said the country would not make progress unless voters had the ""courage"" to confront challenges head-on.
""If you sweep the problems under the rug they ain't going to get better,"" he said.
Sanders is pushing back against arguments by Clinton and her supporters that she would be the most electable Democrat to take on Republicans in the fall. The Vermont senator says the ""excitement and the energy is with our campaign"" and it will help the party drive a large voter turnout in the fall.

Hundreds of people packed a fairground building in Iowa City to hear Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of celebrity backers the day before the Iowa caucuses.
Cruz says on Sunday that the stakes are too high for Iowa voters to make the wrong choice. He says ""we can't get fooled again.""
Cruz and his wife, Heidi, were joined by Cruz's father, Rafael, and by ""Duck Dynasty"" reality TV star Phil Robertson, conservative commentator Glenn Beck and Iowa Rep. Steve King.
Robertson says the country is mired in ""depravity"" and ""perversion,"" but Cruz can turn it around because he trusts God and James Madison, the architect of the Constitution. Robertson says ""That trumps Trump.""
Cruz supporter Carlene Murphy, of Kalona, Iowa, says she thinks the caucuses will be tight, but that Cruz will prevail. She came to see him in Iowa City.
Murphy says, ""I think we're going to pull through.""

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is criticizing a mailer rival Ted Cruz's campaign sent to voters that Iowa's secretary of state says misrepresents the law.
Trump claims at a rally in Council Bluffs that Cruz is under investigation over a ""voting violation"" notice his campaign sent to caucus goers.
Trump says, ""You're not allowed to do it and they're investigating him now.""
""It is so dishonest. It is so dishonest,"" he adds.
In a statement released Saturday, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate says the mailers misrepresent Iowa election law and adds, ""Accusing citizens of Iowa of a 'voting violation' based on Iowa caucus participation, or lack thereof, is false representation of an official act.""
But Pate made no mention of an investigation.
Cruz told reporters in Sioux City on Saturday that the mailing is ""routine.""

Rubio is making an all-out appeal Sunday to about 450 pragmatic Republicans during his last question-and-answer session of the Iowa campaign.
Rubio tells the audience at the University of Northern Iowa, ""It's not just about who you like the most. It's about who gives us the best chance of winning.""
Groups supporting Cruz or Rubio are trading attack ads on the two senators' records on issues, especially on immigration.
And although Rubio has critiqued Cruz for voting to cut military spending, he adds, ""This is not just about making a point, it's about making a difference. This election has to be about the future.""
___
2:50 p.m.
Leaders of a super PAC backing John Kasich are accusing a super PAC backing Marco Rubio of involvement in an attack ad put up by a political group that doesn't reveal its donors.
The American Future Fund recently spent more than $1 million on a New Hampshire commercial calling Kasich ""an Obama Republican."" As a nonprofit, that group does not have to disclose its donors.
American Future Fund and Conservative Solutions PAC, a super PAC backing Rubio, share an ad producer, Outlaw Media, which on its website bills itself as a ""boutique"" firm.
New Day for America cites this and a separate secret-money group that has helped Rubio as clues that the rival candidate's backers are behind the American Future Fund ad. Last year, a nonprofit called Conservative Solutions Project spent $11.6 million on commercials boosting Rubio.
Connie Wehrkamp, a spokeswoman for New Day America, says: ""It's going to be difficult for Rubio's team to keep a straight face denying they are behind the shady dark money attacks.""
A spokesman for Conservative Solutions PAC says his group has nothing to do with the American Future Fund ad - and has not hesitated to contrast with other candidates in ads, meaning it would have little incentive to turn to another group to do so.
The leader of American Future Fund also has said no candidate allies approached him about making the ad.

2:45 p.m.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich says if elected president he'll push Congress to freeze every federal regulation not dealing with health and safety for a full year.
Campaigning at an Elks Lodge in Salem, New Hampshire, Kasich says cutting regulations that kill small businesses would be a priority of his first 100 days. He says after sending Congress a bill to freeze regulations, he'd start a review of ""every regulation in the country.""
Kasich has made reducing the size of government central to his campaign. A clock showing the growing national debt is standard at his town hall events, and he often cites his work to balance the federal budget when he was in Congress during the 1990s.
Kasich is the only candidate in New Hampshire on Sunday as his rivals campaign in Iowa. He does not plan to return to Iowa for Monday's caucuses. He'll host three events in New Hampshire instead.

2:40 p.m.
The Democratic National Committee says it's reached an agreement in principal to have the party sanction and manage more debates during the presidential primary schedule, including a debate in New Hampshire next week.
The DNC says it wants to give Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley time to focus on Monday's Iowa caucuses and would finalize details on Tuesday morning.
The statement comes after the Clinton and Sanders' campaigns traded testy statements about plans for Thursday's debate in New Hampshire and three more during the spring.
Clinton trails Sanders in New Hampshire and wants next week's debate to help her connect with undecided voters before the state's primary on Feb. 9.
Sanders hopes to extend his run deep into the spring and adding three more forums might help him accomplish that goal.

Marco Rubio says watch for the boots.
Marco Rubio says the lofty-heeled boots he caught ribbing about early this month may make a return, if he does well on caucus night.
At the start of a campaign event in Cedar Falls, Rubio joked with people in the front row of the University of Northern Iowa auditorium about sneaking a peak at his footwear.
Did he have them on?
""No, I don't,"" he says, adding they're only for ""really, really, really, really special occasions.
So if Rubio does well in Monday night's caucuses, look out for them.
""They may come back. If I look 6-foot-4 on TV, it's because I'm wearing boots.""

2:30 p.m.
Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad will make appearances on behalf of two candidates before the state's caucuses on Monday.
Branstad says he'll introduce New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at an event Sunday night and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at an event Monday. He says they are the people who asked and who fit his schedule.
The popular six-term Republican has not endorsed a candidate, though he drew headlines recently for encouraging Iowans to support candidates other than Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz opposes the federal renewable fuel standard, which requires a minimum amount of petroleum additives such as corn-based ethanol.
Branstad says the Bush and Christie events are just to show ""appreciation for what they've done for me.""

Republican presidential contender Donald Trump is looking to close the deal with Iowa's evangelical Christian voters on the last day before they caucus.
Trump attended services at the First Christian Orchard Campus, a nondenominational church in Council Bluffs.
He, his wife, Melania, and two staffers took communion when it was passed. But Trump, momentarily confused, mistook the silver plates circulated around the auditorium and dug several bills out of his pocket.
""I thought it was for offering,"" he said with a laugh to his staff.
He contributed several minutes later when the offering plates were passed.
As Trump was leaving one of the church pastors put his hand on Trump's shoulder and offered a prayer, ""That Jesus would guide his decisions and that only Christ could guide his decisions,"" the pastor later said.
Trump gladly accepted, bowing his head.
""Thank you, I need that,"" he said.

The chief super PAC helping Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio raised more than $30 million last year, half of it in the last six months.
Conservative Solutions PAC shared its fundraising numbers ahead of a required filing Sunday with federal regulators.
Billionaire New York investor Paul Singer gave $2.5 million, making him one of Rubio's most generous supporters. In October, Singer wrote a letter to his friends encouraging them to back Rubio in the primary contests. Chicago-based investor Ken Griffin also gave $2.5 million shortly after announcing his support for Rubio in December.
Other seven-figure contributors include Florida auto dealer and longtime Rubio booster Norman Braman, financier Cliff Asness of New York and roofing company executive David Humphreys of Missouri.
Conservative Solutions PAC began the year with about $14 million left to spend.

On a day when presidential candidates report their fundraising totals for 2015 to federal regulators, Democratic contender Bernie Sanders is going a step further. His campaign says it raised more than $20 million this month.
That means his pace is picking up. Earlier, his campaign said it raised $33 million over the last three months of 2015, compared to $37 million for Hillary Clinton's campaign in the same time period.
Clinton's campaign did not immediately respond to a question about its January fundraising.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is upbeat entering the final stretch of his Iowa campaign, while trying to stay realistic about the outcome of Monday's contest.
During an interview on CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" Rubio built expectations for rival Sen. Ted Cruz as ""clearly the front-runner,"" while trying to trim his own prospects the day before the caucuses.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll of likely Republican caucus goers published Saturday showed Cruz trailing billionaire Donald Trump and Rubio in solid third.
Rubio is wrapping up a nine-day blitz of Iowa on Sunday with events in Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids and Davenport.
Rubio tells CBS: ""The crowds are growing. The people signing up are growing. Our campaign structure feels good about it...We'll have a strong showing on Monday night.""

Even at church, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz can't escape politics.
The Texas senator attended services Sunday morning at Lutheran Church of Hope outside Des Moines. The sermon by pastor Mike Housholder called on politicians to treat their opponents with love, not attack ads.
Housholder preached that speaking the truth with love is a better way to treat others. He says if you can't do that, don't speak.
Cruz attended the service with his wife, Heidi, and their two daughters. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley was also there but did not sit by Cruz.
Housholder said after the service he wrote the sermon before he found out the Texas senator would attend and did not tailor it to him.
Cruz greeted parishioners, shook hands and took pictures before departing for his first campaign stop of the day in Iowa City.

Even the candidate who says he's the best, the smartest and the highest-energy in the Republican field is leaving nothing to chance a day out from the Iowa caucuses.
Attendees at Donald Trump's event in Dubuque Saturday night awakened to an email from his Iowa political director, Chuck Laudner, personally thanking them for coming.
And urging them to caucus.
""It is extremely important that you get out there and VOTE for Mr. Trump,"" Laudner wrote. Not sure where? Laudner includes a special tool ""to make this process as easy, and fun, as possible""  the ""Republican Iowa Caucus Finder.""
Click the link and enter a home address and the finder will ""tell you the correct place to show up on caucus night so that you can help elect Donald Trump!""

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says the hubbub over whether she had secret emails on her server is ""very much like Benghazi,"" a politically motivated scandal that's likely not as serious as Republicans suggest.
Clinton told ABC's ""This Week"" that ""it's pretty clear"" that Republicans are ""grasping at straws"" in their response to the latest release of emails from Clinton's private home server. The State Department announced it's withholding some of those emails because the information they contain is too highly classified. The former secretary of state says she's been told some of that email correspondence included a public newspaper article. Clinton insists she never sent or received information on her personal email account that was classified at the time. She repeated her call for the emails' release.
As secretary of state, Clinton presided over a key piece of the government's response to the deadly 2012 assaults on a diplomatic compound and CIA quarters in Benghazi, Libya. The attacks killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and quickly became a political rallying cry for Republicans.

Republican presidential contender Donald Trump says ""many"" senators will endorse his candidacy, ""very soon.""
Trump tells on ABC's ""This Week"" that members of the Senate will choose him over their own colleague, Sen. Ted Cruz, who is also Trump's top rival in Iowa. Trump did not offer any senators' names.
Trump says Cruz is ""a nasty guy"" and a ""liar,"" particularly about whether Trump essentially supports President Barack Obama's signature national health care program. Trump says he would replace that law and make other deals that would accomplish his public policy goals.
Cruz says the nation doesn't need a deal-maker, it needs a ""fighter"" for conservative causes.

Bernie Sanders says he's ready to turn the political world upside down in Iowa.
The Democratic presidential candidate says that if his supporters turn out in large numbers for Monday night's caucuses, ""I think you're going to look at one of the biggest political upsets in the modern history of our country.""
The Vermont senator is in a tight race with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Sanders tells CNN's ""State of the Union"" that his campaign has gotten lots of people involved in politics who hadn't been before. He mentions the working class as well as young people who no longer ""want to sit back"" but want to help direct their country's future.

Donald Trump isn't shy about boasting, but the Republican presidential front-runner says he also has a humble side.
Here's what he tells CBS' "" Face the Nation"" in an interview: ""We're all the same. I mean, we're all going to the same place, probably one of two places, you know? But we're all the same.  And I do have, actually, much more humility than a lot of people would think.""
Asked about hiding that side, the billionaire businessman says, ""I'd rather not play my cards. I want to be unpredictable.""
One thing he's not lacking is confidence. In the interview, he said ""none of the other guys will win.""",8.8,8.7,62.68,0.0,the Associated Press
71,71,1147,First Draft: Hillary Clinton to Open Asian-American Outreach Effort in California,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/hillary-clinton-to-open-asian-american-outreach-effort-in-california/,clinton,nyt,Immigration,9.5,8.4,"As Republican presidential candidates brave the cold in Iowa and New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton heads to San Gabriel, Calif., on Thursday to court an increasingly important, and sometimes overlooked, demographic.

Mrs. Clinton will join Representative Judy Chu for the opening of the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary, an outreach group that could help Mrs. Clinton as she looks to broaden the appeal of her campaign. Ms. Chu is chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.

Although there has been much discussion about how Mrs. Clinton will need to attract Latino and African-American voters if she reaches the general election, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are a growing constituency that tends to lean Democratic.

A study from the University of California, Los Angeles, last summer found that the Asian-American electorate is expected to double to 12.2 million people by 2040, making it increasingly influential.

During Mrs. Clinton’s first run for president, she also made a strong push to attract the Asian-American vote. Highlighting her policies on immigration and job training for people with limited English skills, she outperformed Barack Obama, then an Illinois senator, with that group.

Mrs. Clinton will also spend time fund-raising on her West Coast swing, attending an event hosted by Lisa Henson and David Pressler at Jim Henson Co. Studios, the original creator of the Muppets. No word on whether Bert or Ernie will be in attendance.",8.4,9.5,55.24,0.0,The New York Times
29,29,1462,Democrats hold key debate amid feuding over Sanders' medical records,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/z1CxBpCWk14/democrats-hold-key-debate-amid-feuding-over-sanders-medical-records.html,sanders,fox,Campaign Finance,12.3,11.2,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he will release his medical records, after saying that any attempt by a political rival to get them is “vile and desperate,” as the primary race tightens and becomes more hard-hitting ahead of Sunday’s debate.
Sanders has increasingly cut into the lead of his rival Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, before the debate -- the final one before Iowa residents are set to vote Feb. 1 in the first Democratic and Republican caucuses.
“Of course we’re going to release our medical records, the same way that … Clinton has gotten her medical records out,” the 74-year-old Sanders said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union."" “It is not a problem.”
The Vermont Independent senator and self-proclaimed Democratic-socialist had until Sunday tried to capitalize on the reported request for his medical records by David Brock, founder of the pro-Clinton super-PAC Correct the Record.  
“They are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a fundraising email sent Saturday. 
“Bernie is in excellent health. But this personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and elections.”
Even the Clinton campaign realized the political peril of questioning whether Sanders was fit enough to be president, instead of challenging him on such issues as health care, affordable college, Wall Street reform and income inequality.
“Chill out. We're fighting on who would make a better president, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test,” Clinton campaign manager John Podesta tweeted Saturday to Brock.
The Sunday night debate will be hosted by NBC in Charleston, S.C.
Gun control has been a major issue so far in the 2016 presidential races, but it is expected to be an especially hot topic in this debate.
Clinton is hammering Sanders for just recently supporting a measure that would put more liability on gun manufacturers and for hesitating on whether to support efforts to close the so-called “Charleston loophole” -- which allows a gun sale to proceed if the federal background check on the buyer is not returned in three days.
Clinton and Sanders will be joined on stage by fellow Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley. The former Maryland governor is a strong proponent of tougher gun laws, but is polling only at about 3 percent.
With lots of fundraising money and a last name associated with a political dynasty, Clinton, a former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state, entered the race as the clear front-runner.
However, Sanders’ progressive and inclusive message has captivated voters who appear frustrated by Wall Street and the Washington establishment controlling the direction of the country.
Sanders trailed Clinton nationally 56 percent to 31 percent in late December, but has now cut that lead to 13 percentage points, 51-to-38, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average.
He now trails Clinton by just 4 percentage points in Iowa, after being behind 56-27 in early November. And Sanders now leads Clinton by 7 percentage points in New Hampshire, which on Feb. 9 votes second in the country.
The debate will be the third so far for Democrats.
Sanders began the debate season by letting Clinton off easy, saying Americans were “sick and tired” of hearing about her email controversy, related to her tenure at the State Department.  
Still, the Sanders campaign doesn’t appear ready to launch a major attack this time.
 “We don’t feel like we have to go in there and heat it up,” Sanders adviser Tad Devine told The Hill newspaper.",11.2,12.3,48.13,0.0,Fox News
112,112,156,Donald Trump just plain wrong on torture (opinion),http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/opinions/trump-torture-bergenas/index.html,trump,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,11.9,9.6,"Johan Bergenas is a senior associate at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, a nonprofit institution devoted to enhancing international peace and security through analysis and outreach. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.
 (CNN) Donald Trump says that ""torture works"" and that if elected president, he will bring back waterboarding.
In fact, he says he will allow techniques ""a hell of a lot worse"" than waterboarding and use them regardless of effectiveness on terrorist organizations like ISIS because they ""deserve it."" 
By advocating that the United States brings back torture, Trump again demonstrates his astute understanding of the American electorate. Fifty-three percent of Americans say that torturing terrorists can be justified. Polling only Republicans, the slice of the electorate Trump is trying to charm in this primary season, the number is even larger, over 70%.
One reason behind these large numbers can be gathered from psychological studies in which individuals support the use of torture when the subject is categorized as a terrorist, regardless of its intelligence value.
It may be smart politics to support torture, but Trump's eye-for-an-eye approach to defeat terrorist networks will make the United States less, not more, safe and the American electorate needs to know why, before more ballots are cast.
In fact, today most government officials, regardless of party affiliation, experts and scientists agree with Republican Sen. John McCain that torture ""compromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good.""
Importantly, there is also widespread agreement that American use of torture serves as a recruitment magnet for the world's terrorist networks. Several high ranking government officials note how al Qaeda use Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay as symbolic recruiting tools to reinforce anti-American sentiment and grow their numbers.
In short, Trump's torture policy will fuel the same terrorist organizations that he wants to destroy.
In 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order banning waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques -- the methods Trump says he would reinstall if elected. Instead Obama favors methods that glean intelligence without sacrificing America's ideals, such as a rapport-building approach that is far more likely to elicit good and earlier intelligence than torture. 
When issuing the executive order, the President said that enhanced interrogation methods ""serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists and they increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. ... They did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them.""
Trump is not alone in wanting to bring back torture to the U.S. foreign policy toolkit. Though perhaps not as vocal, other Republican candidates consider a return to the use of torture if elected. Marco Rubio defends the Bush administration's authorization of torture, while Ted Cruz claims that waterboarding doesn't qualify as torture.
The United States has a dark recent past on torture and loose talk by Republicans -- particularly Trump as the party's frontrunner -- on torture damages the country's ability to repair its reputation abroad. More importantly, there are direct links between torture and making America less safe. The policy and talk thereof should hence be returned to the abyss that it was buried in by President Obama over seven years ago.

97,97,177,Donald Trump Shifts to Small and Intimate From Big and Brash,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/08/donald-trump-shifts-to-small-and-intimate-from-big-and-brash/,trump,wsj,Foreign Policy/National Security,5.6,6.8,"SALEM, N.H.Republican Donald Trump set aside the blaring soundtrack and stadium lights typical of his campaign rallies for the most intimate voter forum his presidential campaign has held yet.
Speaking in the round here Monday morning, Mr. Trump refrained from announcing his latest poll numbers and making a long speech. He instead took far more questions from the audience than is typical.
I love these things even more than making a speech, Mr. Trump said during the hour-long forum at the Derry-Salem Elks Lodge.
Mr. Trump is late to the town hall game, with other candidates holding dozens of the forums that New Hampshire voters come to expect of their presidential candidates. The businessman has said he can get his message out more effectively in large crowds. New Hampshire voters go to the polls Tuesday.
As is typical for his events, Mr. Trump kept up his attacks of Republican rival Jeb Bush, saying the former Florida governor has gotten little for the tens of millions of dollars his campaign has spent.
I dont want your money but you have to go out and vote tomorrow. We have to get rid of the Bushes of this world, Mr. Trump said to the crowd of roughly 200 attendees. They are weak, they are ineffective.
He also criticized the pharmaceutical lobby for having too much influence over politicians, and in a new twist, took aim at Bush campaign national finance chairman Woody Johnson. The Johnson & Johnson heir and New York Jets owner could influence Mr. Bushs health-care policy if elected and discourage him from requiring drug companies to lower prescription costs, Mr. Trump said.
A Bush campaign spokeswoman didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.
Several attendees prefaced their questions by saying they were voting for Mr. Trump, and the event was uncontroversial. One man asked Mr. Trump why he opposed Syrian refugees from coming to U.S. towns that welcome taking them in, pointing specifically to Greenwich, Conn.
I can look in their face and say they cant come, said Mr. Trump, a Greenwich property owner, to applause. We dont know where their parents come from.
The Trump campaign committed a candidate faux pas by not beginning the event with a pledge of allegiance per tradition, prompting one attendee to note it was missing. I like that. That was very nice, Mr. Trump said after it was recited.
Mr. Trump asked for votes to give him a mandate at the polls Tuesday. He also got nostalgic about his time in New Hampshire.
You drive through these beautiful areas, the trees on both sides and you want to go hiking, said Mr. Trump, who has pointed to golf as his main form of exercise.
