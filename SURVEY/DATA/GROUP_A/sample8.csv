22,22,1482,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Tells Volunteers in Reno to Expect Victory in Nevada,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/13/bernie-sanders-tells-volunteers-in-reno-to-expect-victory-in-nevada/,sanders,nyt,Immigration,10.7,10.8,"RENO, Nev. —  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont told hundreds of volunteers gathered here on Saturday that his strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were not flukes.

“We surprised them in Iowa,” Mr. Sanders said to cheers. “We surprised them in New Hampshire. We are going to surprise them here in Nevada.”

While Mr. Sanders was expected to beat Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, his 22-percentage point margin was still a resounding victory and one he hoped gives him a tailwind heading into next Saturday’s Democratic caucuses in Nevada. 

He is hoping a win here will convince voters nationwide that he has broad appeal and can garner support from a more diverse electorate than in Iowa and New Hampshire, two predominantly white states. Mr. Sanders on Saturday focused his remarks on economic inequality, campaign finance reform and Wall Street regulation, topics at the core of his candidacy.

“People of Nevada know what Wall Street’s greed, irresponsibility, recklessness, and illegal behavior did,” Mr. Sanders said. “They did it all over this country but maybe no place more profoundly in terms of wrecking lives, than right here in Nevada.”

The senator also spoke to the crowd of 519 people about the importance of immigration reform and said he understands that many undocumented people are living in fear and need substantive legislation from the next president.

“Today, we have 11 million people in this country who are undocumented,” Mr. Sanders said. “I have met people throughout this campaign, young people with tears running down their cheeks, who are literally worried that they or their parents will be deported tomorrow, that they will be separated from their loved ones. Count me in as somebody who will lead the effort for comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.”

Mr. Sanders added that if  “Congress does not do the job that it is supposed to do, then we will use the executive powers of the White House.” 

The senator also touted his immigrant roots Saturday, reminding his volunteers that he grew up watching his family struggle financially.

“My dad came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket from Poland, couldn’t speak English, never made much money,” Mr. Sanders said. “But he was as proud an American as you have ever seen because he saw what America gave to him and his kids, the kind of freedom and opportunity it gave.”

Later, at a forum in Reno, he took questions from the crowd, including one about how he would help “indigenous people,” or Native Americans.

“I have always stood with the oppressed people of this country and there are no people who have been more oppressed than the indigenous people of this country,” he said. “I will stand with you and do everything I can to bring dignity and respect and economic opportunity to those people who do not have it today.”

Mr. Sanders also hugged a woman who told him she was undocumented and feared she would be deported. “I will do everything that I humanely can to make sure you do not continue to live in fear,” he said.

He also reminded the crowd that he had voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law signed by President Bill Clinton that barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage, and which was largely overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013.",10.8,10.7,57.61,0.0,The New York Times
3,3,1480,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Releases Tough Ad on Wall Street Speaking Fees,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/28/bernie-sanders-releases-tough-ad-on-wall-street-speaking-fees/,sanders,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,6.8,8.0,"DES MOINES — Speaking with reporters on Thursday morning, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was asked if he would satisfy some of his frustrated supporters by making a more direct contrast with Hillary Clinton in the final days before the Iowa caucuses.

“I do not intend to run a negative political ad,” Mr. Sanders said at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg Politics.

Did that mean he would run a stronger contrast ad, Mr. Sanders was asked.

“Well, uhhh, contrast ad. Um, I have, by the way, let me just say this, uh, we have run some really beautiful ads, positive ads,” Mr. Sanders said, before then explaining his history of benefiting from positive ads. 

He answered a series of other questions about his foreign policy views and how the political establishment was stacked against him, before being asked again whether he planned to run more “contrast ads” in Iowa.

“Do I plan on running more contrast ads?” he said. “I don’t think we do, but that’s something we are still talking about.”

The conversation is apparently over. On Thursday morning, the Sanders campaign released an ad with the less-than-beatific title “The Problem,” which criticized the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs and other banks for corrupting politics with “millions in campaign contributions and speaking fees.”

Mr. Sanders has done much to lay the groundwork to associate Mrs. Clinton with Wall Street, highlighting her acceptance of speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and it’s role in the mortgage crisis. And on the stump and interviews now, Mr. Sanders has added a new line noting that Hillary Clinton went to Philadelphia last night for a fund-raiser at an investment bank.",8.0,6.8,73.17,0.0,The New York Times
16,16,1526,Message of Bernie Sanders’s New Ad: The Housing Crisis Isn’t Over,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/19/message-of-bernie-sanderss-new-ad-the-housing-crisis-isnt-over/,sanders,wsj,Immigration,9.1,9.2,"The housing crisis has faded from the national conversation, but it is resurfacing as a potentially potent issue ahead of Saturday’s Democratic caucus in Nevada, where Bernie Sanders has released a new ad that speaks to its lingering devastation.
The ad, entitled “Our Home,” shows pictures of boarded up ranch-style homes and features homeowners speaking in English and Spanish about the experience of losing their homes.
The 60-second spot also highlights the interesting political moment, where a candidate running for the nomination of the incumbent party isn’t really running on the record of the party’s outgoing president. This is no “Morning in America.”
The housing crisis is nowhere near as acute as it was four or eight years ago, but Las Vegas is still ground zero. Around 22% of borrowers in the metro area owe more than their home is worth, the highest rate in the nation, according to Zillow. Of course, this is down from an astoundingly high 69% in 2012.
The drop reflects both the strong rebound in home prices over the last four years and the write-down of bad mortgage debt, primarily through foreclosure. Even in the hardest hit states such as Nevada and Florida, the share of mortgages that are delinquent or in foreclosure has also fallen sharply and are finally close to their pre-crisis levels.


But the ad illustrates how the memories of homes lost or marriages that fell apart aren’t fading even if the raw statistics show the acute crisis has passed. It doesn’t have to say what Mr. Sanders would do differently, now or then. Instead, it reinforces Mr. Sanders’s central campaign theme: the nation’s institutions, especially Wall Street, failed the country, and the government didn’t do nearly enough to respond for ordinary citizens.
The ad is heavy, but Mr. Sanders’s reading the “I approved this ad” disclaimed in Spanish is worth a grin. (Which New Yorker did it better?)
One observation the ad doesn’t make: Home prices have rebounded strongly in the U.S. and in Nevada over the past four years to a degree that few imagined was possible in 2012. Yale economist Robert Shiller said at the time he was worried “we might not see a major turnaround in our lifetimes.”
Many of Mr. Obama’s strongest critics on the left argued that without a massive program of debt forgiveness, prices wouldn’t recover meaningfully because foreclosures wouldn’t end.
Instead, low interest rates, an improving job market, and strong demand from investors soaked up the oversupply of homes, though pockets of distress remain. Now, many Western markets face a different housing crisis—a shortage of affordable homes, for sale or for rent.
In that sense, the ad effectively captures the frustrations many Americans still have with the economy. A few years ago, the idea that gas prices would fall below $1.75 a gallon, home prices would rise 20%, and the unemployment rate would drop below 5% would have seemed like implausible fantasy. All of those things happened, but Mr. Obama has received very little credit because the prosperity doesn’t seem to be broadly shared.",8.8,8.7,62.68,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal
73,73,1148,First Draft: Major Donors to Clinton Include Napster Co-Founder,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/14/major-donors-to-clinton-include-napster-co-founder/,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,10.3,9.2,"Sean Parker, the youthful billionaire and co-founder of the music-sharing service Napster, gave nearly $300,000 to a joint fund-raising committee for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and dozens of state Democratic parties, federal filings show. 

Mr. Parker was one of several donors in recent months to give to the Hillary Victory Fund. Others include the media mogul Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl, and the billionaire trader and philanthropist George Soros; all gave more than $300,000. The Chicago-based entrepreneur J.B. Pritzker gave more than $350,000. 

The latter donors have been long familiar to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Parker, by contrast, is relatively new to the world of political giving, having only become a donor in the last several years. He has held meetings with politicians as disparate as Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. He gave to President Obama’s re-election effort in 2012 and also to the immigration reform group FWD.us. 

In the joint fund-raising entities, the Clinton campaign has asked major donors to consider giving money, because they face a number of options for gifts to the Democratic candidate that exceed $2,700, the maximum contribution allowed in the primary campaign. One is Priorities USA, the “super PAC”  supporting Mrs. Clinton, which just invested more than $4.5 million in trying to help her in the primary fight against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 

The joint fund-raising committee sends $34,500 of a donor’s contribution to the Democratic National Committee and spreads the rest among 33 different state party organizations.",9.2,10.3,53.21,0.0,The New York Times

Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. The presidential candidates turned their focus to South Carolina, where the Republicans’ primary comes Feb. 20 and the Democrats’ a week later. Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz courted evangelicals at Bob Jones University. Donald Trump challenged his chief rival in the state via Twitter, “How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?” A Cruz ad showed a boy explaining the features of a Trump action figure, saying, “He pretends to be a Republican.“

2. Hillary Clinton also unrolled a new ad, one that ties her to President Obama in supporting tighter gun laws, an issue many Democrats see as a vulnerability for Bernie Sanders. And at a campaign event in South Carolina, she said Mr. Sanders “has called the president weak, a disappointment. He does not support, the way I do, building on the progress the president has made.” A “super PAC,” Priorities USA, has a $500,000 campaign of radio ads stressing her leadership in helping blacks.

3. Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, tried to douse the fire set by her comment about Bernie Sanders supporters, “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” In an essay in The Times, she wrote, “I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line.”

_____

4. The widening gap between rich and poor, one of the most powerful themes of the presidential campaigns, includes a disturbing disparity in life spans. New research looking at both ends of the income spectrum showed that the gap, which has not been fully explained, has more than doubled since the 1970s, to about 14 years. “This may be the next frontier of the inequality discussion,” one analyst said.

5. Pope and patriarch sat down together, the first time that the leaders of the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches met since the branches splintered nearly 1,000 years ago. “Now things are easier,” Patriarch Kirill said. “It is clear now that this is the will of God,” Pope Francis responded.

6. Major League Baseball issued its first lifetime ban over performance-enhancing drugs, banishing the Mets pitcher Jenrry Mejia after he tested positive for a third time.

_____

7. The family of a man killed in the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project saluted the jury that convicted a New York City police officer, Peter Liang, of manslaughter. “There are many more police officers who need to be held accountable,” the family said in a statement. “We hope this case will send a message to all N.Y.P.D. officers and police departments around the country and around the world that they can’t kill and get away with it anymore.”

8. The hatchet Kanye West and Taylor Swift buried a few years ago got disinterred. A day after Mr. West’s fashion show/album release sold out Madison Square Garden, he added a song that included a sexual reference to Taylor Swift and claimed responsibility for her fame. Ms. Swift’s brother threw his Kanye-designed Yeezy sneakers in the trash and posted a video of the act on Instagram.

9. The Rio Olympic Games are still six months away, but this Texas gymnast looks like a real possibility to win gold. Our sports columnist calls Simone Biles, 18 and not quite five feet tall, unfathomably powerful and “the best American gymnast since, well, probably ever.”

_____

10. The U.N. groped for details about how to create a “humanitarian task force” for Syria called for by a new cease-fire deal between the U.S. and Russia. But at the border with Turkey, some Syrians doubted the bombing would end. “The deals they make there are so isolated and detached from this reality here,” one said.

_____

11. Success Academy, a leader in New York City’s charter school movement, has long had critics of its methods for achieving a stellar record of performance on standardized tests. Now there’s concern that some teachers become emotionally abusive, after a video emerged showing one mercilessly berating a first grader for a wrong answer. In interviews, other teachers said demeaning of children was a regular occurrence.

_____

12. Lastly, over the long Presidents’ Day weekend, the public is invited to help with the Great Backyard Bird Count. Last year, 140,000 people in more than 100 countries classified nearly half of the world’s bird types during the four-day event. We’ll be looking forward to the results of the annual accompanying photo contest.

Have a great weekend.
