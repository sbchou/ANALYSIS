98,98,246,First Draft: Donald Trump Says He’ll Release Tax Returns ‘at Some Point’,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/donald-trump-says-hell-release-tax-returns-at-some-point/,trump,nyt,Campaign Finance,5.6,6.8,"Donald J. Trump said Monday that he would release his tax returns “at some point, probably,” after the radio host Hugh Hewitt pressed Mr. Trump about when he would make them available, warning that delaying in doing so had damaged Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012.  

“When do we get tax returns, Donald Trump, because Mitt Romney got killed on this four years ago,” Mr. Hewitt said in an interview with Mr. Trump, according to a transcript provided by his aides. “”And you’ve got to get them out there as well.” 

“Well, we’ll get them out at some point, probably,”  Mr. Trump said. “I mean, I’m looking at it. I told my people the other day, start looking at it.” 

His returns, he added, “are among the largest. I’m audited all the time by government. And I think every single year, I’ve had an audit for years. And you know, other people, friends of mine say they never get audited. I say congratulations. I have audits every year. So it’s, you know, one of those things. But we are working. They’re very complex papers, but we’re working on it.” 

Mr. Hewitt pressed on, “Will we get them soon, do you think?” 

 “I don’t know,” Mr. Trump replied. “I have to ask my accounting people. But we’ll be working on it. Everything is very much, you know, I gave my financials ahead of schedule, much ahead of schedule. I had a long time to give them, and I gave them immediately. And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.” 

Mr. Romney, who was a private equity executive before he was elected governor of Massachusetts, was savaged by a “super PAC” supporting President Obama, with campaign ads calling him a heartless corporate raider. Mr. Romney did not release his tax returns until the September before the general election that year, when more people were paying attention. They showed he paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent. He had faced months of pressure to release the returns. 

On the eve of Tuesday’s Republican caucuses in Nevada, where he is expected to do well, Mr. Trump also told Mr. Hewitt that he does not like the caucus system, which relies heavily on organizing and is more complex than a primary system. 

“I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it,” said Mr. Trump, who finished second to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Iowa caucuses. “I really don’t believe it’s a good system. You know, I like to have a person walk in, vote and leave, as opposed to walk in, sit around, and who knows what happens. So you know, that’s my preference, but let’s see. I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.” 

In that regard, Mr. Trump has something in common with Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who have criticized the caucus system in the past for similar reasons.",6.8,5.6,76.22,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump

With enemies like these, who needs friends?

Senator Bernie Sanders often boasts that he has no “super PAC” supporting his candidacy and he has vigorously tried to keep any from forming. But he has been getting some unsolicited if mischievous help from Republican groups actively promoting the Vermont senator’s surging campaign.

America Rising, a Republican political action committee, reacted with glee on social media on Tuesday to a CNN/WMUR poll that showed Mr. Sanders with a large lead over Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire, sharing the news with “BREAKING” qualifiers and links to news stories.

Karl Rove’s American Crossroads recently created an ad parroting Senator Bernie Sanders’s critiques of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, made repeatedly last week in the days before Sunday’s debate.

And during the debate, Republican groups were blasting out rapid emails defending Mr. Sanders’s positions, including his universal health care plan, an issue many Republicans would embrace as warmly as they would higher taxes.

All of it, of course, is intended to get under Mrs. Clinton’s skin and promote the Democratic candidate they believe would be weaker in a general election. Republican groups and super PACs have spent nearly $5 million targeting Mrs. Clinton so far this cycle. They’ve yet to spend a dollar on advertising attacking Mr. Sanders.

The Clinton campaign released a statement saying this support only furthers their argument that Mrs. Clinton is the candidate the Republicans are most afraid of facing.

“The Sanders argument falls apart when the G.O.P. spokesman is trying to help him and the Republicans run ads trying to stop Hillary Clinton in the primary,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for the Clinton campaign, in a statement. She asserted that Mr. Sanders was “taking his cues” from Mr. Rove, though the senator’s Wall Street attacks predated the Rove ad.

The effort on the right to attack Mrs. Clinton from the left has actually be underway for a while, with groups like American Crossroads and America Rising targeting digital content criticizing Mrs. Clinton’s positions on the Keystone oil pipeline, for example.

“The idea is to make her life difficult in the primary,” Colin Reed, America Rising’s executive director, said last year.",7.6,8.8,57.27,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders

All told, Mrs. Clinton has taken $2 million so far from donors rounded up by lobbyists, most based in Washington. Lobbyists raised another $236,000 for a joint fund-raising committee Mrs. Clinton set up with the Democratic National Committee, according to the filings.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was second over all and the leading Republican recipient of lobbyist-raised money during the fourth quarter of 2015, with $676,000 coming in from bundlers who are registered lobbyists. They have raised more than a million dollars for his campaign, the most of any Republican candidate. 

Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, came in third, with less than $200,000 for the quarter and $409,000 for the election cycle.

The disclosures are required only for registered lobbyists, not for fund-raisers who happen to work at lobbying firms but are not themselves registered.

114,114,902,Trump unscathed in GOP ad wars,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/politics/primary-conflicts-2016/index.html,trump,cnn,Campaign Finance,12.3,12.4,"Washington (CNN) With just a month to go before the first votes for president are cast in Iowa and New Hampshire, TV audiences are being treated to an onslaught of 30-second attack ads as candidates smear each other with the help of ominous narrators, grainy footage and foreboding music.
Yet Donald Trump, the party's undisputed front-runner for six months, remains the only candidate unscathed so far.
Here's a look at some of the most recent spots.

Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have been tussling for months, first over each other's immigration stances and now over national security. 
RELATED: As negative ads pile up in Iowa, Ted Cruz plots a bigger footprint
On Monday, the super PAC backing Cruz released a new spot to paint Rubio, who has been dogged by questions about his Senate attendance record, as unserious. Using footage from a lighthearted video Rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against America before cutting to video of Rubio discussing fantasy football. The ad is set to run in Iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by Rubio ahead of the caucuses.
Rubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security.

And a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, released an ad Tuesday touting Rubio's electability that calls him ""the one Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against,"" an attempt to tweak Cruz over concerns about his general election viability due to his hardline conservatism. 

Cruz isn't the only candidate with whom Rubio is locking horns.
This week, the Florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, just as the brash governor is threatening Rubio's status as the GOP establishment's preferred candidate.
Rubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions, put up two ads in New Hampshire, blasting Christie over his record in New Jersey. The first calls Christie ""Obama's favorite Republican governor"" and criticizes his support for an Internet sales tax, the Common Core education initiative and 'liberal"" energy policies. 
The second ad slams Christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: ""High taxes. Weak Economy. Scandals.""
Christie's team is hitting back. In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for ""someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out."" The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform. 

Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are hoping that strong showings in Iowa -- where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively -- will help sustain their campaigns. 
And as they woo social conservatives and evangelicals in the Hawkeye State, they're taking aim at Cruz.
An ad from Santorum's campaign this week seeks to do this by contrasting the former Pennsylvania senator's tenure with Cruz's. A narrator recounts Santorum's achievements before cutting to video of Cruz reading ""Green Eggs and Ham"" during his 2013 filibuster over Obamacare.
Huckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super PAC, Pursuing America's Greatness, releasing an ad titled ""Two Teds."" The attack attempts to paint Cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of Cruz at a New York City fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration.
The two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa -- and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.

Meanwhile, Trump, who overwhelmingly leads the rest of the GOP field according to a CNN/ORC poll released late last month, has received his share of flak from other candidates and the groups supporting them, even if they've failed to dent his seemingly impenetrable poll numbers. 
The Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. In November, the group released a spot effectively comparing Trump to Hitler and the Nazis, and the PAC is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in New Hampshire.
Meanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul ""reckless"" and ""impulsive"" in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he ""wasted"" $40 million.
Trump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.",12.4,12.3,53.55,0.0,CNN,Donald Trump
29,29,1462,Democrats hold key debate amid feuding over Sanders' medical records,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/z1CxBpCWk14/democrats-hold-key-debate-amid-feuding-over-sanders-medical-records.html,sanders,fox,Campaign Finance,12.3,11.2,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he will release his medical records, after saying that any attempt by a political rival to get them is “vile and desperate,” as the primary race tightens and becomes more hard-hitting ahead of Sunday’s debate.
Sanders has increasingly cut into the lead of his rival Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, before the debate -- the final one before Iowa residents are set to vote Feb. 1 in the first Democratic and Republican caucuses.
“Of course we’re going to release our medical records, the same way that … Clinton has gotten her medical records out,” the 74-year-old Sanders said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union."" “It is not a problem.”
The Vermont Independent senator and self-proclaimed Democratic-socialist had until Sunday tried to capitalize on the reported request for his medical records by David Brock, founder of the pro-Clinton super-PAC Correct the Record.  
“They are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a fundraising email sent Saturday. 
“Bernie is in excellent health. But this personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and elections.”
Even the Clinton campaign realized the political peril of questioning whether Sanders was fit enough to be president, instead of challenging him on such issues as health care, affordable college, Wall Street reform and income inequality.
“Chill out. We're fighting on who would make a better president, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test,” Clinton campaign manager John Podesta tweeted Saturday to Brock.
The Sunday night debate will be hosted by NBC in Charleston, S.C.
Gun control has been a major issue so far in the 2016 presidential races, but it is expected to be an especially hot topic in this debate.
Clinton is hammering Sanders for just recently supporting a measure that would put more liability on gun manufacturers and for hesitating on whether to support efforts to close the so-called “Charleston loophole” -- which allows a gun sale to proceed if the federal background check on the buyer is not returned in three days.
Clinton and Sanders will be joined on stage by fellow Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley. The former Maryland governor is a strong proponent of tougher gun laws, but is polling only at about 3 percent.
With lots of fundraising money and a last name associated with a political dynasty, Clinton, a former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state, entered the race as the clear front-runner.
However, Sanders’ progressive and inclusive message has captivated voters who appear frustrated by Wall Street and the Washington establishment controlling the direction of the country.
Sanders trailed Clinton nationally 56 percent to 31 percent in late December, but has now cut that lead to 13 percentage points, 51-to-38, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average.
He now trails Clinton by just 4 percentage points in Iowa, after being behind 56-27 in early November. And Sanders now leads Clinton by 7 percentage points in New Hampshire, which on Feb. 9 votes second in the country.
The debate will be the third so far for Democrats.
Sanders began the debate season by letting Clinton off easy, saying Americans were “sick and tired” of hearing about her email controversy, related to her tenure at the State Department.  
Still, the Sanders campaign doesn’t appear ready to launch a major attack this time.
 “We don’t feel like we have to go in there and heat it up,” Sanders adviser Tad Devine told The Hill newspaper.",11.2,12.3,48.13,0.0,Fox News,Bernie Sanders
