45,45,1949,Takeaways from Ted Cruz's Iowa road trip,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/cruz-iowa-takeaways/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,8.7,10.0,"Strawberry Point, Iowa (CNN) He is the front-runner, and he knows it.
On the surface, Ted Cruz looked as strong as ever during his six-day, 28-county bus tour across the Hawkeye State last week week, filling Christian bookstores and old schoolhouses as he trekked from the Missouri to the Mississippi rivers at a workmanlike pace. He took dozens of shouted questions each day at events not billed as town halls, and reveled in the adoration given to a candidate who badly wants to earn top billing here on February 1. 
His red meat connected. His crowds swelled. His applause never ended.

He also has, by most accounts, a first-class ground game and as of this Wednesday, a high-powered super PAC operation to fund his message on the airwaves here.
But beneath the surface, Cruz's hold on Iowa is tenuous, a close observation of 15 of his events reveals. He's on the defensive over his ethanol position, has had his religion and citizenship questioned. And there's still plenty of time for the dynamics of the race to shift against him.
Here's what we learned from Cruz's bus tour -- and what can still hold him back in the final three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.

Cruz spent much of the week fielding persistent questions not about his momentum in Iowa, but about his mother's voting history in Canada and whether he was being 100% truthful about his knowledge of what happened north of the border. It was, in the eyes of any political observer, off message.

The son of a Cuban man and an American woman, most legal experts agree Cruz is a naturally-born U.S. citizen eligible to be commander-in-chief. 
Cruz told CNN's Dana Bash that he's not concerned about the issue. ""Of course not,"" Cruz said. ""Yes, I'm sure. The media, with all due respect, love to engage in silly sideshows. We need to focus on what matters.""
""The legal issue is straightforward,"" he added, calling it a ""non-issue."" ""Listen, the Constitution and the laws of the United States are straightforward. The very first Congress defined the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad as a natural-born citizen.""

Trump does not appear to see it that way. Although the billionaire has not outright said Cruz is ineligible to be president, he intensified his criticism at two Iowa campaign rallies on Saturday.
""He was born in Canada. I guess his parents voted in Canada,"" Trump said in Clear Lake. ""So if you were born in Canada, immediately it's a little bit of a problem.""
After six months of never veering off the message of unbridled respect for the national GOP front-runner, Cruz this week said that he wouldn't be accepting unsolicited legal advice from him and suggested that Trump is ""panicking"" because of Cruz's recent surge in Iowa polls.

""A few weeks ago, everyone in the field was attacking Donald Trump,"" Cruz said time and time again across northern Iowa, barely containing his smile. ""Now, everyone's attacking me. That suggests something's changed."" 
But the most substantive political point came late Friday evening in a basement at Mabe's Pizza in Winneshiek County. It was his sixth stop of the day -- Cruz had more energy than the press corps and senior staff traveling with him -- when a man asked him to directly pitch why he should vote for Cruz over his rival.
""Listen, there is an 'Iowa way' of campaigning and deciding caucuses. I believe the only way to compete and win in the state of Iowa is to come and spend the time asking the voters for their support, looking them in the eye, having the humility to submit yourself to the men and women of this state,"" his voice racing forward and raising in volume. ""And if a candidate is not doing that, that ought to be an indication."" 

At event after event in northern Iowa, Cruz was repeatedly confronted by audience members who lodged emotional, and sometimes agitated, complaints about his record on ethanol and desire to eliminate the Renewable Fuel Standard.
There was the man in the Casey's General Store in Manly who button-holed Cruz and wouldn't let him go until an aide physically moved the senator onto a different voter. There were the farmers who asked, with a pang of concern, whether there was just something about Cruz's position that they must've misheard.
""I'm a corn farmer. I've been following your campaign and I see that you've modified your stance on the RFS,"" Bob Hemesath, a local corn industry leader, asked Cruz in Decorah. ""And in reality, you haven't really modified your stance.""
Cruz nodded. On that, they agreed.
Read: For Ted Cruz, the last voter in the room is the hardest
Cruz has tried to pitch Iowans on other parts of his ethanol policy beyond the RFS, most prominently rolling back an EPA regulation that limits the amount of gasoline that can be in an ethanol blend. But these Iowans that Cruz has tried to win over were rarely convinced by those arguments, which they see as B-list concerns to the RFS that Cruz wants to phase out within five years.
At nearly every stop, Cruz would motion behind him and point at the best validator he could, Dave VanderGreind, an Iowan ethanol magnate who agreed with Cruz's point that the RFS was not the be-all-end-all.  
The campaign wants to keep repeating its message, and when the team was surprised to see no one ask about his position on the RFS in Webster City on Thursday, Rep. Steve King whispered in Cruz's ear.
""Alright, so Steve raised one additional question. He said there may be someone here wondering about ethanol,"" Cruz said. ""So let's talk about that for a second.""

The scourge of Washington Republicans -- he has few friends in the Senate -- and of critics who label him robotic, harsh and grating, Cruz is offering Iowans a look at a kinder, gentler side in the final weeks before voters here decide his fate. It is his campaign's soft sell, its final attempt to show Republicans that he isn't just right on the issues, but decent enough and homely enough to win their vote.
""It's not just smart politics. It's smart relationships,"" said Bob Vander Plaats, who is standing a step behind Cruz at every stop on his bus tour as one of Cruz's top allies in the state. ""You're seeing him being more vulnerable."" 
When a woman in a hotel lobby told Cruz about the death of her son, a veteran who suffered from post-traumatic disorder, the Texas firebrand lowered his voice to something close to a microphoned whisper: ""My mom lost my older brother as an infant,"" he shared.
At Dr. Thomas Gleason's Airplane Hangar in Webster City, he told Edith Verman-Frank, a 76-year-old survivor of two simultaneous stage four cancers, that his mother too was a 15-year breast cancer survivor. Two questions later, Cruz was explaining to Jaci Bagwell that he understand her worries about student loans debt -- he only paid off his $100,000 in debt five years ago.
But Cruz has worked hard over the past seven months to maintain his standing as the most conservative candidate in the field, and his outpourings of empathy have political limits.
When asked in the hotel lobby in Storm Lake by a young, undocumented woman who said she was troubled by Cruz's new plan that he would deport people like her immediately if elected, Cruz showed no pity. 
""Well, listen, I would note if you're a DACA recipient, it means that you were brought here illegally,"" Cruz told her as the room grew silent. ""And violating the laws have consequences.""",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,CNN,Ted Cruz

Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, stopped for lunch Friday afternoon at Keys Cafe in St. Paul before a pair of events in a state whose caucuses are March 1.

You want the scoop? Mr. Sanders said, turning to the news media entourage that now routinely trails him as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination. “The scoop is tuna salad and rye with lettuce and tomato.
There’s more.
Jane Sanders ordered a grilled cheese sandwich on white, and Mr. Sanders also had a bowl of turkey wild rice soup.
When the Sanderses and their Secret Service detail entered the restaurant, one employee gaped and said: Are you kidding me? Bernie Sanders?
Yes, Bernie Sanders.
The owner, Carol Hunn-Gregory, sat at the booth and briefly chatted with the couple while photographers captured the moment.
I told him I appreciated him stopping and that were remodeling and I was sorry about the mess, she said later.
So, has Ms. Hunn-Gregory made up her mind whom to support? It was Hillary, but Ive kind of been on the fence, she said. Bernie has a lot of good issues dealing with health care. I like the single-payer system.",6.4,5.2,77.23,-0.8,The Wall Street Journal,Bernie Sanders
102,102,367,Ingraham: Trump's campaign strategy is to take down all opponents Mafioso-style,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/ZnFKx855-JY/ingraham-trumps-campaign-strategy-is-to-take-down-all-opponents-mafioso-style.html,trump,fox,Immigration,8.7,10.0,"Radio host Laura Ingraham told viewers Tuesday on ""Special Report with Bret Baier"" that Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is aiming to permanently take rivals out of the presidential race. 
Ingraham compared the New York businessman’s overarching campaign strategy to that of a Mafia syndicate:  ""Trump's made a calculation that the only way to win [the election] is do what they did in the opening scene of the 'The Godfather,'"" Ingraham explained,  ""You have to take out the other families. You've got to get them in the revolving door, at the altar, at the phone booth.”
Noting a favorite Trump target, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his extended family, she said, ""[Trump has] decided, I guess, the only way to do it is to really settle the score on Bushism: on globalism, trade, immigration, the War [on Terror].  And he's doing it in a way that is really strident and really offends a lot of people.""
Ingraham said Trump’s anti-Bush theme is a risky strategy, as there’s ""a lot of affection, maybe, for the personality, the people, the patriotic side of the Bushes,” an apparent nod to George H.W. Bush’s long tenure in public service and George W. Bush’s handling of the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks.
“Could it pay off?  I think we're going to find out,” Ingraham said.",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,Fox News,Donald Trump
107,107,761,Trump deflects specifics when it comes to abortion position,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/politics/donald-trump-abortion/index.html,trump,cnn,Abortion,8.7,8.8,"Marshalltown, Iowa  (CNN) Donald Trump touted the strength of his anti-abortion position during a press conference Tuesday, but dodged questions testing the specificity of those views.
The press conference comes less than a week before Iowa's traditionally conservative Republican voters head to caucus sites and the same day a group of an anti-abortion leaders urged Iowans to oppose Trump's candidacy, suggesting inconsistencies on the issue.
""All I can tell you is this I'm pro-life and I've been pro-life a long time,"" Trump said Tuesday.
But Trump said in 1999 that while he hated the ""concept of abortion"" he was ""pro-choice."" On the 2016 campaign trail, Trump has positioned himself as an opponent of legalized abortion.
Asked what penalties he would support for women who undergo abortions or doctors who perform them, Trump demurred.
""I just don't want to talk about that right now. Everybody knows my views and I think my views are very plain,"" Trump said.
Addressing supporters following the press conference, Trump conceded that his views on abortion have changed and noted that when he was just a businessman he ""never gave it much thought.""
""When it comes to pro-life I've evolved,"" Trump said.
Asked by reporters whether he considers Plan B, the morning after pill, to be the same as an abortion, Trump again would not divulge his position.
Instead, Trump touted a recent endorsement from prominent evangelical leader Jerry Falwell, Jr., the president of the evangelical Liberty University and son of its founder, and pointed to poll numbers showing him ahead of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in support from evangelical voters in Iowa.
Cruz has spent recent weeks questioning Trump's conservative credentials and suggesting that Trump's ""New York values"" are not aligned with the conservative views of Iowan Republican primary voters.
Trump fired back as he has in recent days, calling Cruz ""really a nasty person.""
""I question Ted Cruz. I question him very (strongly),"" Trump said when asked about Cruz challenging Trump's values.
Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who will join Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio on the campaign trail in Iowa this week, also asked this week whether Trump had repented for his marital infidelities.
""I think everybody knows about me,"" Trump said simply, adding later that bringing that up was a ""cheap shot.""
Flanked by Maricopa County Sherriff Joe Arpaio, who gained notoriety for his hardline policies aimed at undocumented immigrants, Trump did offer some additional details on his pledge to build a wall on the U.S.'s southern border and deport all undocumented immigrants living in the United States.
Trump first said he would ""get Congress's approval"" before implementing those policies, before adding that he ""would at least speak to Congress."" 
Trump also touted his plan to deal with illegal immigration as the ""toughest"" of the presidential candidates.
During the press conference, Trump also announced he was likely to skip Thursday's GOP debate due to a deepening fight with the Fox News Channel. 
Afterward, Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Trump's decision on the debate was final.
""Mr. Trump will not be participating in the Fox News debate on Thursday night. It's not under negotiation,"" he said.

HIGHLIGHTS
STATE DEPARTMENT TO WITHHOLD HILLARY CLINTON EMAILS WITH HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION: The State Department said Friday nearly two dozen of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‘s emails contained highly classified information, and it will launch a review into whether they were classified at the time they were sent or received. State Department spokesman John Kirby said that 22 documents containing “top secret” information will be excluded entirely from the release of Mrs. Clinton’s email archive. So far, more than 1,300 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails have been redacted, with portions blocked out, due to the presence of classified information, but this is the first example of emails being entirely withheld from public release.
Mr. Kirby also said the State Department would conduct an investigation to determine whether the emails were classified at the time they were sent or received on Mrs. Clinton’s personal email server. That marks a shift from the longtime State Department position that any classification was done after the fact. Mr. Kirby added that whether they were classified at the time or not, they didn’t contain markings identifying them as classified. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, wrote on Twitter:  “This is overclassification run amok. We adamantly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails.” Byron Tau reports.

INCOME FOR RECENT GRADUATES THE HIGHEST IN OVER A DECADE: The labor market has taken a sharp turn for the better for young college graduates. Incomes for the newest batch of diploma-holders have reached the highest level in more than a decade and their unemployment rates are falling quickly, according to a new economic report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Their experience now underscores a growing divide in the U.S. economybetween those with a college degree and those without. The median holder of a bachelor’s degree, ages 22 to 27, earned $43,000 last year, an increase of over $3,000 from the year before. That is the highest since 2003, showing that the job market for freshly minted graduates has nearly recovered to the best years on record.  Josh Zumbrun reports.
CENTRAL BANKS TRY UNCONVENTIONAL POLICY TOOLS: Central banks around the world are going to new lengths to boost their economies, underscoring both the importance and limitations of monetary policy in a global economy plagued by paltry growth and unsettled markets. In the latest shift, the Bank of Japan Friday joined a number of European peers in setting its key short-term interest rate below zero for the first time. The move, long denied as a possible course by the banks own governor, came a week after the European Central Bank president said he was ready to launch additional monetary stimulus in March, and just days after the U.S. Federal Reserve expressed renewed worry about market turbulence and sluggish growth overseas. Anjani Trivedi and Eleanor Warnock report.
U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT ANEMIC RATE IN FOURTH QUARTER: The U.S. economy sputtered in the final months of 2015, a possible sign of flagging momentum amid global weakness and turmoil in financial markets. Gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic output, expanded at a 0.7% seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. The economy had advanced 2% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter. Despite weak first and fourth quarters to bookend the year, growth for 2015 as a whole was steady. For the full year, GDP expanded 2.4%. Jeffrey Sparshott reports.
