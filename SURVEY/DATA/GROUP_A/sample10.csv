93,93,270,First Draft: My Firsthand Encounter With Donald Trump’s Free Media Machine,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/24/my-firsthand-encounter-with-donald-trumps-free-media-machine/,trump,nyt,Campaign Finance,5.2,7.6,"The other day, a host on MSNBC asked me if Donald J. Trump had a good enough campaign operation to win in Nevada. One thing Mr. Trump had going for him, I pointed out, was that he was very good at getting the news media to give him free airtime. 

“Every time he opens his mouth, he’s on national TV, telling jokes and giving his message — so he’s saved himself tens of millions of dollars doing that,” I said. Almost as soon as I finished making my point, the network demonstrated it by cutting to a Trump rally in Atlanta.

Such is the unusual world of Mr. Trump’s political finances. As a reporter who covers campaign finance, I spend my days trying to figure out where the money is. But Mr. Trump presents a different sort of challenge: Not so much where the money is, but where the money isn’t. 

The only person who has spent less money running for president than Mr. Trump — and who hasn’t yet stopped running for president — is John Kasich. This is partly because Mr. Trump was famous in his own right before he plunged into the 2016 race. It is also partly because many of Mr. Trump’s campaign expenses, such as rides on his own private jets and helicopters, or borrowing aides from his real estate empire, get paid out to his own companies. 

But even beyond that, it is because Mr. Trump doesn’t spend much on television ads, usually the single most expensive budget item for a modern presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump garners what political hacks call “earned media.” He holds big rallies, says provocative things that his audience adores — “I’d like to punch him in the face,” Mr. Trump said of a heckler at his event in Nevada on Monday — and reaps of a wave of news coverage in newspapers and on television. This dynamic has earned the scorn of Trump-haters on the right and left, who have taken to blaming the news media for enabling Mr. Trump’s rise. 

Mr. Trump is undeniably a showman. Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a poll-tested message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the earned-media department, then proceeded to “trump” Mr. Trump, with a 20-minute riff on “squirmishes” and “proud clingers.”)

Just how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals — Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz — are spending a combined $1.5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday.

34,34,1952,Ted Cruz: 2016 Is a ‘Referendum’ on the Supreme Court,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/15/ted-cruz-2016-is-a-referendum-on-the-supreme-court/,cruz,wsj,Abortion,6.0,7.2,"AIKEN, S.C.In the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is stepping up his campaign-trail focus on what impact the 2016 election could have on the Supreme Court.
He warned the addition of a liberal justice to the bench threatens to turn federal judicial policy sharply to the left on issues ranging from gun rights to abortion.
I intend to make 2016 a referendum on the Supreme Court, Mr. Cruz said in a rally at Aiken, S.C., his first campaign event since Mr. Scalias death Saturday. Adding to the litany of actions he would take on his first day as president, Mr. Cruz said, I will have no more solemn responsibility than to name a replacement for Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.
Providing a glimpse of how the impending court battle may be reshaping the focus of the 2016 primary fight, Mr. Cruz also used the issue to give conservatives a new reason to vote against his rival, GOP frontrunner Donald J. Trump.
Donald Trump, if he were president, would appoint liberals to the court, Mr. Cruz said to reporters before the rally. Donald has been liberal his entire adult life, he said, citing Mr. Trump’s support for abortion rights, among other issues.
Mr. Trump pushed back Monday, releasing a statement calling Mr. Cruz’s comments “totally untrue and completely outrageous.”
“I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William ‘Bill’ Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes,” Mr. Trump said.
He called himself “staunchly pro-life” and “one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms.”
Some of Mr. Cruzs supporters in the audience said they shared his concern about the future of the court, and were also unsure what kind of justices Mr. Trump would choose if he were president.
I dont know what he is going to do. Hes all over the place, said David Howell, 60, a retired software engineer from Lexington, S.C. Im wondering if he is some kind of Manchurian candidate.",7.2,6.0,75.2,0.0,The Wall Street Journal

All told, Mrs. Clinton has taken $2 million so far from donors rounded up by lobbyists, most based in Washington. Lobbyists raised another $236,000 for a joint fund-raising committee Mrs. Clinton set up with the Democratic National Committee, according to the filings.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was second over all and the leading Republican recipient of lobbyist-raised money during the fourth quarter of 2015, with $676,000 coming in from bundlers who are registered lobbyists. They have raised more than a million dollars for his campaign, the most of any Republican candidate. 

Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, came in third, with less than $200,000 for the quarter and $409,000 for the election cycle.

The disclosures are required only for registered lobbyists, not for fund-raisers who happen to work at lobbying firms but are not themselves registered.

No other candidate reported any money raised by lobbyists.",9.2,10.3,53.21,0.0,The New York Times
47,47,1704,Cruz changes tune on rounding up undocumented immigrants,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/politics/ted-cruz-illegal-immigrants-bill-oreilly/index.html,cruz,cnn,Immigration,9.1,9.2," (CNN) Ted Cruz moved to a more aggressive deportation policy in an interview on Monday night, saying he would look for and deport undocumentedl immigrants using Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, marking a change from a January interview with CNN.
Appearing on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" on Fox News, Cruz was repeatedly pressed on the specifics of his deportation plans by host Bill O'Reilly, who asked Cruz, ""Would you go look for them, though? As (Donald) Trump would look for them to get them out, would you do that if you were president?""
""Bill, of course you would, that's what ICE exists for,"" Cruz said. ""We have law enforcement that looks for people who are violating the laws, that apprehends them and deports them.""
O'Reilly offered a hypothetical example of an immigrant from Ireland with ""a couple of kids and he's settled into Long Island.""
""And you, President Cruz, are going to send the feds to his house, take him out, and put him on a plane back to Ireland?"" O'Reilly asked.
""You better believe it,"" Cruz said.
Cruz's comments to O'Reilly stand in stark contrast from his previous rhetoric on the issue. 
In a January interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Cruz had said he would not deploy a ""deportation force,"" as Trump as suggested he would do as president.
""I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,"" Cruz told Tapper. ""We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement."" 
Chad Sweet, chairman of Cruz's presidential campaign, had also said after CNN's Republican presidential debate in December that the Cruz campaign supported ""attrition through enforcement.""
Cruz, winner of the GOP Iowa caucuses, is at a critical point in his campaign, following two significant losses to Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina. He also fired his communications director on Monday for circulating a misleading video about rival Marco Rubio.
His next test is Tuesday, when Nevada Republicans head to their caucuses.

Bernie Sanders denounce Wall Street and call for an overhaul of the campaign finance system on Friday were treated to a frosty dessert afterward.
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, founders of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream, served ice cream to several people bundled up against the weather.

Earlier, the Vermont ice cream men introduced their home state senator at his rally here, explaining to the crowd why he is their favorite flavor of presidential hopeful.
“He’s the only presidential candidate I’ve ever created an ice cream flavor for,” said Mr. Cohen, who launched Bernie’s Yearning (mint ice cream topped with solid chocolate) in January.  “The man has even made Hillary Clinton want to be a progressive.”
Mr. Sanders returned the praise, lauding their business practices and environmental advocacy.
Messrs. Cohen and Greenfield, who are known for the left-wing activism as well as their ice cream, each donated $1,400 to his presidential campaign last year and $1,000 to his senate campaign in 2011. according to Federal Election Commission reports.",8.8,11.1,45.76,0.0,The Wall Street Journal
