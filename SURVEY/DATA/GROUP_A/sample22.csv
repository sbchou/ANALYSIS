56,56,2104,Why Cruz is in trouble in Texas,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/25/politics/ted-cruz-super-tuesday-texas/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.1,11.2,"Houston (CNN) Of all the states, Texas was the one Ted Cruz was not supposed to have to worry about.
As reviled as he may be back in Washington, Cruz has been adored here at tea party rallies and Republican conventions ever since he first upset the political establishment with a shocking come-from-behind victory in 2012. In his home state, Cruz often comes across as a rock star, a leader so admired by the grassroots that his endorsement in legislative primaries is the closest thing to a gold standard in state politics.
But thanks to Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, Cruz's shot at becoming President may end in Texas.
Cruz, despite his appeal as a native son ideologically in sync with a ruby red Republican base, could very well lose the Texas primary next week, a setback that would strike at the core of Cruz's southern political strategy. 
Both Trump and Rubio are squeezing Cruz in the Lone Star State, cutting into his lead by blanketing the airwaves and working side by side to engineer an upset. Trump continues to hit Cruz with claims the senator is a ""liar,"" and Rubio wants to show he can win establishment and anti-Trump votes, which means taking from Cruz.

Cruz aides remain optimistic that he can still compete elsewhere on Super Tuesday, but they have nevertheless sent stakes for his performance back on his home turf to new heights.
""This is make or break for Cruz. He has to win -- no close second is good enough,"" said Bill Miller, an unaligned, senior Republican lobbyist here. ""Unquestionably he's favored -- and it has been in the bag -- but the bag has a weak bottom.""
Most political observers still give Cruz the slight upper hand and expect him to claim the plurality of the state's 155 delegates, which his team believes can put him close to even in the delegate race after March 1. 
And Cruz certainly is not taking Texas for granted -- working the state's political machinery since the moment he announced and on Wednesday rolling out his highest-ranking endorsement yet anywhere in the country, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.
The question, however, is whether of any of that will be able to stop the freight train of momentum that is Trump, who is planning a huge rally in Fort Worth on Friday morning.
""Most people are just listening to the message, and they're not necessarily going to have loyalty toward Cruz just because he's our current senator,"" said Wayne Richard, a Dallas-area activist supporting Trump. Richard acknowledged Cruz's strong field program, but was skeptical it would make much of a difference and that Texas could have a ""devastating impact"" on Cruz's White House hopes.
Recent polling has shown Cruz with a solid, but not insurmountable lead over Trump. A Monmouth University survey released Thursday gave Cruz a particularly wide margin, putting him 15 points above Trump. And Cruz's vaunted ground game numbers 27,000 volunteers, which observers say gives Cruz even more of an edge. 
Cruz is doing virtually nothing to tamp down expectations. On Tuesday, he called March 1 ""the single most important day in this presidential election.""

But it's not just Trump that poses a threat: Cruz is also confronting an increasingly dangerous Rubio, whose campaign would like nothing more than to kneecap their arch-rival in his home state. 
The Florida senator's super PAC has made its largest investment on Super Tuesday in Cruz's home state, sinking millions of dollars into territory it might not win with the hopes of embarrassing the candidate who really needs it.
Rubio also stands to benefit from the Bush bundler network, which is particularly deep in this town, migrating over into his camp.
""Rubio or bust,"" said Jacob Monty, a former Bush fundraiser here. ""No one from Bush has gone anywhere but Rubio. Rubio is the only hope for rational Republicans who would like to win the general.""
Monty, like other Latino Republican leaders in Houston, have also gravitated to Rubio. He was introduced at a rally in a hotel ballroom Wednesday afternoon by two of the country's most prominent Hispanic Republicans, and his crowd was more solidly Latino than most Cruz crowds.
 
""You're from Texas,"" Rubio told his supporters when someone interrupted him to shout something in Spanish. ""You know what he said.""
Rubio's team recognizes it is unlikely to win as many delegates in Texas. But although some of Texas' 155 delegates are awarded statewide, most are distributed via congressional district: a candidate who earns more than 50% in one of the state's districts wins all three delegates in the district, and anyone who earns below 20% wins zero. So if Rubio's camp can surgically target Cruz and minimize his vote percentage in key districts, they can keep him from building a delegate lead on Super Tuesday.
""You can get nowhere near first place in Texas and still vacuum up a whole lot of delegates just because of the size of the state,"" said Todd Harris, Rubio's chief strategist. ""We're under no illusions that there won't be a resounding Ted Cruz victory, but there are things that we think we can do on the margins to sweep up some delegates -- and we're going to do it.""

Cruz received a hometown hero's welcome at the Lincoln Reagan Dinner on Wednesday evening, where his stickers firmly stuck to guests' blazers.
That dominance wasn't always a sure thing.
A year ago at this same dinner, the question in this city in the pre-Trump era was which of the men who have called it home would emerge victorious: Would it be Jeb Bush, whose father remains revered here by both Democrats and Republicans alike? Rick Perry, the powerful, 14-year governor? Rand Paul, who grew up in a nearby suburb? Or Cruz, who headquartered his campaign not far from his condominium? 
Or maybe an outsider: Scott Walker, who wowed as a keynote speaker here eleven months ago with odes to Reagan and who Abbott said governed ""like a Texan"" in Wisconsin.
The threat to Cruz has indeed been an outsider, but one that no one in this booming oil city saw coming.
So in the final days of the Texas primary, Cruz is looking to remind them of their shared roots. As he collected Abbott's endorsement in a factory on Wednesday afternoon, Cruz's rhetoric was awash with Texas pride and symbolism, calling on his constituents to cast aside their fascination with the New Yorker they love and vote for the Texan they know.
""We are not a people who are impressed by a lot of blustery rhetoric that's not backed up by truth,"" Cruz said. ""We can't be fooled by P.T. Barnum. The time for the clowns and the acrobats and the dancing bears has passed.""",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN
42,42,1885,New Yorkers blast Cruz's comments on 'New York values',http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-01-15-US--Cruz-New%20York%20Values/id-1d883b4be3d04a2898b9dafad2200b02,cruz,ap,Campaign Finance,8.4,8.4,"(AP)  When Ted Cruz sneered at what he called Donald Trump's ""New York values,"" some New Yorkers took it very personally. And some responded about the way you'd expect New Yorkers to react.
The ever-combative Daily News hit the streets with a big front-page illustration of the Statue of Liberty giving Cruz the finger. The headline: ""DROP DEAD, TED."" And in a reference to the Texas senator's birthplace, the tabloid added: ""You don't like N.Y. values? Go back to Canada!""
On the morning after Thursday night's Republican presidential debate, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took to the airwaves to denounce the candidate and demand an apology for comments he called ""obnoxious on every level.""
The use of ""New York values"" as a term of abuse rankled plenty of city residents.
""Like that's a bad thing?"" said Willie Perry, a real estate salesman and registered Republican, as he headed to work in New York City. ""Actually it's a good thing. I think that's ludicrous. What did he mean by that?""
John Markowski, a minister who was dropping his son off at a public school, said: ""It's insulting for anyone to make a derogatory comment about New York values. I think we pride ourselves on being a place of diversity and equality.""
During the debate, moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Cruz to explain past comments he had made about Trump embodying ""New York values.""
""You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are,"" Cruz said.
""I am from New York. I don't,"" Bartiromo said.
So the GOP conservative explained: ""Listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.""
Trump responded movingly by citing the city's response to 9/11.
""When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,"" he said to applause from the crowd in North Charleston, South Carolina. ""We rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.""
He added: ""And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.""
One in 38 Americans lives in New York City, but the state's record of going for the Democrat in the winner-take-all electoral college system means Republicans rarely have to worry about insulting the populace. Bashing the big city has long been a winning strategy in more conservative parts of the country, namely the Midwest and the South.
Not a lot of New Yorkers have given money to Cruz's bid for the White House. His campaign took in only about $487,000 from New York contributors through Sept. 30, according to the most recent filings. But one New Yorker, Wall Street hedge fund mogul Robert Mercer, contributed $11 million last April to a super PAC that supports Cruz.

2,2,1349,Ad of the Week: Bernie Sanders Relies on Supporters for Ad About Unity,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/politics/bernie-sanders-relies-on-supporters-for-ad-about-unity.html,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,6.8,8.0,"After letting Simon and Garfunkel speak for him in one ad, Senator Bernie Sanders has turned over his latest to his supporters, several of whom created a 60-second spot titled “Together.”

Only Mr. Sanders’s voice is heard, delivering a clarion call to unite Americans across every conceivable demographic line. But on the screen, portraits of scores of different faces appear and disappear in a blink. Many are ripped in half, as if to illustrate the danger of divisive politics. Old snapshots of families of every possible background flash by. Finally, the two halves of unrelated people’s portraits are merged, to signal the strength that comes from uniting people despite their differences.

Adding to its power is the ad’s back story: It was submitted by supporters of Mr. Sanders and chosen by curators of such content in an effort overseen by his wife, Jane. In a sense, then, others are already taking up the banner of the revolution Mr. Sanders is trying to foment.

That revolution is possible only with the broadest popular support. “Our job is not to divide,” Mr. Sanders shouts. “Our job is to bring people together.” It does not hurt that this message of unity is well timed, as Mr. Sanders seeks to expand his appeal among blacks in South Carolina, Latinos in Nevada and other constituencies as his primary battle with Hillary Clinton expands nationally.

The spot began its life as a short video, shown on a big screen before the band Vampire Weekend performed an acoustic set at a Sanders campaign rally in Iowa City. The crowd erupted as the video reached its conclusion. Since then it has gone viral, earning millions of views and comparisons to President Obama’s 2008 “Yes We Can” ad. Seeing the video’s popularity, the campaign bought the ad on Friday and said it would begin airing it this week.

Election contests are, by their nature, divisive. But amid the testy debates and stump speech sniping, this ad reminds viewers that the campaign is ultimately about everyone — a rare injection of togetherness when the nation is being coldly deconstructed by candidates and their strategists into a jigsaw puzzle in either red or blue.

Changing channels ...

Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign did not know it at the time, but the actress hired to deliver the money line in a negative ad against Senator Marco Rubio — calling him “just a pretty face” — had starred in soft-core pornographic films. When the campaign was apprised of her filmography, the ad was quickly pulled.

Right to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, released a highlight reel of Donald J. Trump’s most boorish moments, portraying Mr. Trump as a coward and Mr. Bush as “the better man.” At the end, it cut to the comically awkward entrances of the candidates at the last debate: With Mr. Trump oddly waiting in the wings with Ben Carson, Mr. Bush emerges from behind them, pats Mr. Trump on the shoulder, then cocks an eyebrow and smirks as he strides by, never looking back.

A 1992 hip-hop song, “Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta,” found immortality on the soundtrack of the cult-favorite film “Office Space” in 1999. Mr. Cruz’s campaign, continuing a string of satirical ads, spoofed the song in a spot mocking Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. “Damn it feels good to be a Clinton,” the lyrics say.

79,79,1239,Op-Ed Columnist: Hillary Clinton Stumbles,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/opinion/hillary-clinton-stumbles.html,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,11.1,11.2,"In October, when Hillary Clinton made a spectacle of the congressional Benghazi committee during a marathon interrogation that seemed designed to make a spectacle of her, she emerged stronger than ever. Her polls numbers surged.

That performance had come on the heels of a strong debate performance the week before in the first Democratic presidential debate.

She had bolstered the image she wanted to project: strong, smart, capable and battle-tested.

But now, on the verge of Monday night’s Democratic town hall in Iowa — the last time the candidates will face off before the caucuses in that state — and with Bernie Sanders’s poll numbers climbing not only in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign seems increasingly desperate and reckless.

I noticed the turn in the last debate as Clinton seemed to me to go too far in her attacks on Sanders, while simultaneously painting herself into a box that will be very hard to escape.

She wrapped herself in President Obama’s legacy so tightly that she could hardly breathe, and then built an image of herself as a practical politician who could build on Obama’s accomplishments by taking small steps and negotiating tough deals.

But practicality and incrementalism, as reasonable as that strategy and persona may be, are simply no match for what animates the Sanders campaign — a kind of kinetic, even if sometimes overblown, idealism. His is a passionate exposition of liberalism — and yes, democratic socialism — in its most positive light.

But, let me be clear and unequivocal: I find his earnest philosophic positions to be clear and often laudable, but also somewhat quixotic. I think that he is promising far more than even he knows he can deliver, and the electability question is still a real one, even though polls now show him matching up well against possible Republican opponents.

For instance, Sanders’s plan for universal health care is an admirable ambition of any true liberal, but as presented seems to me unworkable, and the prospect of getting it passed through this Congress or any Congress that vaguely resembles it is nil. Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare, which is far shy of Sanders’s proposal, more than 60 times. Suggesting that it would pass something even more expansive is mere fantasy.

When Sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a “political revolution,” which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the Senate and possibly the House.

Interesting, but also unlikely. Go talk to all the Blue Dog Democrats who lost their seats in the wake of Obamacare passage. Go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. Go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure Republican leadership, and therefore prevent Medicaid from being expanded in their states.

There are political realities that exist in America that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.

Furthermore, Sanders likes to tout that he doesn’t have a “super PAC” and doesn’t want one. That is a principled position. But the Republican candidate will have the support of many super PACs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the Republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. They are going to beat Sanders like a he is a nail with the “socialist” label and his proposal on new taxation. Middle of the spectrum Middle America is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.

But instead of Clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than Sanders’s, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about Sanders’s honor.

The swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-Obama because he wanted Obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap Obamacare, simply do not connect.

Sanders may be a dreamer, but he’s not dishonorable. Trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.

There are a tremendous number of echoes starting to be heard between the way Clinton ran against Obama, and the way she is running against Sanders.

Clinton has what political insiders call the “firewall”: Overwhelming support among black and Hispanic voters in Southern and some Western states. But a win by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could supply a boost of momentum that could greatly erode the Clinton firewall.

If Clinton can’t find a positive, energetic message to project, and soon, she is going to be swept away by Sanders.

Some part of Sanders’s proposals and even his vision for this country may indeed be a fairy tale. But in the 2008 race, Bill Clinton criticized Obama and his position on the Iraq war as a “fairy tale.” Well fairy tales sometimes come true, particularly when Hillary Clinton stumbles.",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,The New York Times
57,57,1745,Cruz's 2016 strategy focuses on turning out white voters,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/386c25518f464186bf7a2ac026580ce7/Article_2016-02-05-US--GOP%202016-Cruz-White%20Turnout/id-b92587c622404c15b18976ec822c1a91,cruz,ap,Immigration,11.5,10.4,"(AP)  Ted Cruz has mapped out a path to the White House that all but ignores the explosion of minority voters in America.
The Texas senator's general election strategy depends almost wholly upon maximizing turnout among millions of conservative white voters  mostly evangelical Christians and the white working class  who didn't participate in the last presidential contest.
At the same time, Cruz's team is banking on a sharp decline in black and Hispanic support for the 2016 Democratic nominee, whoever it is, returning to voter trends before Barack Obama shook up the electorate as the nation's first black president and won an overwhelming share of support from non-white voters.
It is a strategy that defies the conventional wisdom in the GOP that says the party can win the White House again only if it appeals to political moderates and non-white voters who are becoming a greater share of the voting-age population as each day passes.
""I'm an outlier,"" said longtime Cruz aide Jason Johnson, the chief architect of the Cruz playbook, which he concedes is not in line with modern-day Republican thinking.
Yet with overwhelming confidence born from a year of studying voter trends, Johnson insists the first-term Texas senator can win the general election by motivating a coalition of his party's most reliable supporters.
""It is absolutely the case that in 2012, there were a little over 2 million fewer white non-Hispanics that voted compared to 2008,"" Johnson said this week in an interview with The Associated Press. ""They sat it out.""
The strategy will not be tested unless Cruz survives the long road ahead in his party's hotly contested nomination process to represent the GOP in November's general election. Still, general election viability has emerged as a major theme in the days leading up to New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary among the leading Republican candidates.
Many Washington Republicans warn that Cruz is simply too conservative to appeal to the wide swath of voters that typically decide general elections.
""They are just wrong about this,"" said Republican operative Matthew Dowd, who served as the chief political strategist for George W. Bush. ""It is about both motivation and persuasion. You can't motivate your base and at same time turn off moderates and independents.""
But Cruz this week repeatedly declared that his team assembled a coalition in Iowa that would translate into general election success.
""We saw conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats all coming together,"" he said during a town hall-style meeting at a Portsmouth Toyota dealership. ""If we're going to win, if we're going to win the nomination and we're going to win the general election, we've got to bring that coalition together.""
""That's what it's going to take to win the general election,"" he said.
The Cruz strategy is born by necessity.
While his team notes he won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 2012 Senate election in Texas, and Cruz has the potential to become the nation's first Hispanic president, hardline conservative rhetoric on illegal immigration has defined his short political career. He has promoted endorsements from far-right conservatives such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, Cruz's national campaign co-chairman who has compared immigrants in the country illegally to drug mules and livestock.
GOP leaders commissioned an exhaustive report after the 2012 elections calling for candidates to adopt more welcoming tones on immigration. But a hardline stance on immigration remains popular among white voters across America who make up the majority  albeit a shrinking majority  of the voting-age population and tend to vote Republican.
Trump's sustained popularity is based in part on such anti-immigrant rhetoric. And more than 60 percent of Republicans polled by CNN last summer said the U.S. government should focus on stopping the flow of immigrants in the country illegally and deporting those already here. About 30 percent of Democrats said the same.
Johnson, Cruz's top strategist, believes that Cruz can win in November even if he earns only 30 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally  a modest increase from Mitt Romney's 27 percent four years ago. And among black voters, Johnson envisions Cruz winning over roughly 10 percent, which is in line with the GOP's performance in 2000 and 2004.
Cruz has no plans to back off his hardline stance on immigration. His team has determined there is no evidence that immigration policy alone is a major factor win winning over Hispanic voters.
""It's not a panacea,"" Johnson said of immigration reform, citing internal and public polling. ""Even if we had to do better than 30 percent, that wouldn't do it.""
Yet the country's demographic shifts have prompted some Republicans to reach the opposite conclusion and work harder to appeal to non-white voters, who by 2052 will make up a majority of the eligible voting-age population, according to a study by conducted last year by Washington think tanks representing both parties.
GOP leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and recently departed presidential candidate Rand Paul have spoken extensively about poverty alleviation and criminal justice reform  issues that particularly resonate among black and Hispanic voters.
The share of all voters nationwide who are white has dropped consistently since 1996, according to census data. Even 2004, a year in which the total number of white voters increased by more than 10 million, failed to reverse that trend.
Yet Cruz's team is correct to note that millions of white voters sat out the 2012 elections. Census voting data shows about 2 million fewer white voters cast ballots in 2012 than 2008  the only time since 1996 that the total number of votes cast by a racial group has decreased from one presidential election to the next.
Some Republican strategists, including Dowd, suggest the missing voters are concentrated in states that aren't likely to be contested in the general election. They argue that even if Cruz gets them to vote, they won't improve his November prospects.
Cruz's team won't ignore minority voters altogether. The campaign has an African-American outreach director, and Cruz this week promised to campaign in Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods at some point. His major challenge is to drive white turnout while not completely alienating minorities.
""You can't just go out and throw red meat on the table just because you know it will help turnout on one side of the equation,"" he said. ""We're either right or wrong.""
