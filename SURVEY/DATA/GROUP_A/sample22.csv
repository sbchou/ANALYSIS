65,65,1092,Clinton super PAC gets big donor boost,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/clinton-campaign-donations-super-pac/index.html,clinton,cnn,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton's super PAC collected more than $9.5 million in January, more than half of which came from five wealthy donors.
Priorities USA Action earned a $3.5 million check from James Simons, a New York City hedge fund manager and philanthropist on Jan. 11, the group told the Federal Election Commission in a filing on Saturday. 
Jay and Mary Pritzker, two members of a prominent and wealthy Chicago family, also gave a total of $2 million to the group just a few days before Clinton essentially tied Bernie Sanders in Iowa. Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham gave $1 million. Texas trial lawyer and prominent Democratic donor Steve Mostyn added $1 million.
Clinton herself added to that financial advantage over Sanders -- who does not have an authorized super PAC -- with a $14.9 million haul for her campaign. She had nearly $33 million on hand as of Jan. 31. Priorities USA Action had nearly $45 million in cash on hand at the end of January.
Sanders' campaign outraised Clinton's campaign in January though, raising $21.3 million. His campaign now claims more than 4 million individual donors and does not have an official super PAC.

On the Republican side, Ted Cruz had substantially more money on hand at the end of January than the other GOP candidates still in the race. The day before Cruz won Iowa, he had $13.6 million, while candidates like John Kasich only had under $1.5 million.
Some Republican super PACs reported additional seven-digit donations on Saturday: Oracle executive Larry Ellison gave $1 million in January to Marco Rubio's group, and a Texas LLC called Trinity Equity, with some ties to Cruz megadonor and close friend Toby Neugebauer, contributed $1 million to Cruz super PAC, Stand for Truth. 
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had a less-than-stellar fundraising month. Having come up short in Iowa and New Hampshire, his super PAC raised $320,000 in all of January. That's a significant drop from a year ago when the outside group was seen as a fundraising juggernaut. 
Donald Trump, winner of the South Carolina Republican primary on Saturday, reported loaning his campaign $5 million -- which will likely play into his narrative about self-funding his campaign.",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,CNN,Hillary Clinton
4,4,1584,Sanders raised $20 million in January,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/sanders-clinton-trump-cruz-campaign-finance-super-pacs/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,7.9,9.2,"(CNN) Bernie Sanders raised more than $20 million in January, his campaign announced Sunday, as top presidential contenders and super PACs look to tout their fundraising prowess and bank accounts ahead of February's caucus and primary run.
Sanders campaign says its January haul came from more than 777,000 individual contributions. It also plans to report to the Federal Election Commission that it raised $33.6 million in the last three months of 2015.
All campaigns and super PACs must file their 2015 reports with the FEC by the end of Sunday. Some are in good shape and will hype their numbers, especially their cash-on-hand heading into the month, in order to instill donor confidence in their campaign's ability to go the distance. 
Sunday is also the first chance in six months to see what how much big donors are giving to super PACs, the outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash to help candidates. 
Hillary Clinton's top super PAC, Priorities USA, said Friday it has raised $50 million through this month, with another $42 million in pledges. Clinton's campaign also announced it had $38 million on hand as of the end of the year.
And while Sanders, who has sworn off super PACs, a group run by National Nurses United is backing the Vermont senator and has raised $2.3 million, with about half of that remaining, the group reported.

The best funded group of all, as of Sunday early afternoon, is Marco Rubio's super PAC, which raised nearly $16 million in the second half of 2015 and had about $14 million on hand.
Several individuals gave $1 million to the group, including Norman Braman, a Rubio mentor from Florida who has now given a total of $6 million to the super PAC. And two new billionaire donors to Rubio's circle, Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, each gave $2.5 million to the super PAC.

The super PACs supporting Ben Carson and Rand Paul are poor, while the outside groups supporting Chris Christie and Ted Cruz are relatively rich, new campaign finance filings show.
Carson's main super PAC, The 2016 Committee, raised $6.1 million in the second half of 2016, but spent nearly all its money and retained only $560,000 as of December 31. And Rand Paul's authorized group, America's Liberty PAC, has been beset by scandal -- its top two operatives were once indicted -- and now has poor fundraising results: it only collected $1.4 million, with only about $830,000 on hand.
Other groups are in stronger position: Christie's group, America Leads, raised $5.1 million thanks to prominent hedge-funder Steve Cohen, who sank another $2 million to the super PAC. It still had $3.3 million on hand. 
Stand for Truth, a mysterious pro-Cruz super PAC that formed only recently, revealed its donors on Sunday -- nearly half of the money raised by it came from the family of Adam Ross, a close Cruz friend from Texas. It still had $2.1 million in the bank.",9.2,7.9,70.13,0.0,CNN,Bernie Sanders
6,6,1475,First Draft: Bernie Sanders a Target of Ads by Republican Donor,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/25/bernie-sanders-a-target-of-ads-by-republican-donor/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"A “super PAC” founded by the former TD Ameritrade executive Joe Ricketts is spending more than $600,000 on a television ad in Iowa lashing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as “too liberal” in the final days of his close race against Hillary Clinton in the state’s caucuses. 

The spot, being aired by the ESA Fund, describes Mr. Sanders’s policy positions on a range of issues, such as tuition-free college and single-payer health care, saying that it amounts to a flood of new government spending. There will be tax increases on Wall Street, big businesses and the “super-rich,” the ad goes on to say. 

The spot is expected to be backed by $600,000 in spending on television ads, and there will be additional expenditures on radio and digital advertising. 

Mr. Ricketts has been a major Republican donor this cycle in the presidential race, but with the ad, his group is injecting itself into the Democratic nominating contest.

“When it comes to federal spending and piling on our massive debt, Secretary Clinton is a five-car pile-up, but Senator Sanders is a trainwreck,” said Brian Baker, the president of the ESA Fund. “Given that Senator Sanders is the leading candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire and way ahead in the general election polls, ESAFund will work hard to inform voters about his record and future plans.” Mr. Sanders leads in many head- many national polls.

ESA Fund is the affiliated super PAC of Ending Spending, which was founded by Mr. Ricketts and is operated by his son, Todd Ricketts, who is on the board of the Chicago Cubs. It is laser-trained on fighting what it considers excess spending by the government. 

The elder Mr. Ricketts gave $5 million to the super PAC that backed Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race last fall. And Todd Ricketts helped run Mr. Walker’s national fundraising efforts for his campaign. 

Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said he had not seen the ad but added, “Are they against strengthening Social Security? Raising the minimum wage? Don’t they want to make college affordable? Do they like Wall Street and big banks? Do they want to keep tax loopholes that let profitable corporations evade taxes?”

Despite the current general election match-ups in public polling, Mr. Sanders is far less known nationally than Hillary Clinton, meaning his negative ratings are lower. 

The strategy of attacking Mr. Sanders seems reminiscent of how Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a Democrat, ran ads targeting Todd Akin, a conservative and the opponent she most wanted to face because he seemed less electable in a general election. That is also the bar that Mr. Sanders has been fighting to clear.",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders
101,101,116,Donald Trump and the Art of the Mideast Peace Deal,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/22/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-mideast-peace-deal/,trump,wsj,Foreign Policy/National Security,8.4,8.4,"Aaron David Miller is a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars and most recently the author of The End of Greatness: Why America Cant Have (and Doesnt Want) Another Great President. He is on Twitter: @AaronDMiller2.
Presidential elections produce stunning bursts of pro-Israel sentiment and support from candidates of both political parties.
This year the fraught relationship between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Iran nuclear deal, and candidates’ desire to be on the right side of the angels on this issue have led to particularly intense pro-Israel rhetoric.
Sen. Marco Rubio routinely uses the biblical terminology Judea and Samaria to refer to the West Bank; Sen. Ted Cruz promises to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to tear up the Iran nuclear agreement if elected president; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before he dropped out of the race on Saturday said he would restore the trust with Israel that the Obama administration had destroyed; and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledges that “with every passing year we must tie the bonds tighter,” and has promised that she would take the U.S.-Israeli relationship to “the next level.”
Amid all this is an outlier: Donald Trump’s rhetoric is decidedly less effusive and his tone much cooler and more detached than his rivals when it comes to Israel and Jewish issues. One might expect Mr. Trump, a New York real estate and business magnate with deep contacts and friendships in the Jewish community, to be noisier and louder on Israel than all the other Republican candidates. He has made positive statements –Ive devoted so much time over my life to Israel,” and The other politicians, they can talk, but believe me, they havent done what Ive done.–but compared to his GOP rivals Mr. Trump has been strikingly low key on this subject.
Mr. Trump was booed at a December meeting of the Republican National Jewish Coalition for not promising, if elected president, that he would move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, though last month he reversed his position. Such pledges are standard fare for Republicans and even some Democrats, but Mr. Trump initially dodged the question.
In a December interview, Mr. Trump wondered aloud whether Israels and Palestinians want to make peace.
A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal–whether or not Israels willing to sacrifice certain things, he said.
Instead of blasting the Palestinians in ways that have become routine political talking points, Mr. Trump demonstrated a kind of negotiators detachment. And in contrast to other GOP candidates, Mr. Trump described Israeli housing projects–presumably he meant settlements in the West Bank–as a huge sticking point in negotiating any deal.
During last week’s MSNBC town hall meeting in South Carolina, Mr. Trump declined to say whether Israelis or Palestinians were to blame for the violent clashes. If I win, I dont want to be in a position where Im saying to you, and the other side now says, We dont want Trump involved, we dont want… Let me be sort of a neutral guy, lets see whatIm going to give it a shot. It would be so great.
What explains Mr. Trumps coolness in a campaign where hotly touting pro-Israel credentials is par for the course? Is it his self-confidence? He told the Republican Jewish Coalition, “you’re going to love where I am on Israel.”
Is he such a self-financed maverick that he doesnt care about Republican Jewish support and has no intention of pandering? Youre not going to support me,” he told a gathering of Republican Jews, even though Ill be the best guy for Israel.”
Or could the driving factor be that Mr. Trump would love to try to make a deal between Israel and the Palestinians? He has expressed his interest and enthusiasm for this several times. Striking a deal “would be a really great achievement,” because theres been “so much death, so much turmoil, so much hatred.”
He told the Associated Press that getting a deal to end the prolonged conflict is “something I’d really like to do.” Is it possible that to preserve his credibility as a mediator, Mr. Trump purposefully avoids adopting positions that might prejudice success in a future negotiation?
Mr. Trumps posture on Israel represents an intriguing bit of unpredictability on a politically sensitive issue about which most of his rivals are quite predictable. It’s fascinating that on almost every issue, he is brash and bold, yet on such a diplomatically sensitive issue as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he is circumspect and careful. Mr. Trump frequently cites his consummate skill as a negotiator.
Could it be that the author of “The Art of the Deal” believes he can achieve what no U.S. president or secretary of state has accomplished — brokering an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians?",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The Wall Street Journal,Donald Trump

Bernie Sanders denounce Wall Street and call for an overhaul of the campaign finance system on Friday were treated to a frosty dessert afterward.
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, founders of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream, served ice cream to several people bundled up against the weather.

Earlier, the Vermont ice cream men introduced their home state senator at his rally here, explaining to the crowd why he is their favorite flavor of presidential hopeful.
“He’s the only presidential candidate I’ve ever created an ice cream flavor for,” said Mr. Cohen, who launched Bernie’s Yearning (mint ice cream topped with solid chocolate) in January.  “The man has even made Hillary Clinton want to be a progressive.”
Mr. Sanders returned the praise, lauding their business practices and environmental advocacy.
Messrs. Cohen and Greenfield, who are known for the left-wing activism as well as their ice cream, each donated $1,400 to his presidential campaign last year and $1,000 to his senate campaign in 2011. according to Federal Election Commission reports.",8.8,11.1,45.76,0.0,The Wall Street Journal,Bernie Sanders
