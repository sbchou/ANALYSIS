53,53,1743,Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented immigrants,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-deportation-guns-terrorism/index.html,cruz,cnn,Immigration,10.7,9.6,"(CNN) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN's Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump.
Cruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union"" that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S.
 
""No, I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,"" Cruz told Tapper as his campaign bus ambled across northern Iowa.
Trump has promised to authorize a ""deportation force"" to remove those immigrants from the U.S., pledging to do it ""humanely."" Trump has repeatedly charged that Cruz is merely copying his immigration positions, but Cruz has called his plan ""the most aggressive"" in the GOP field.
Earlier this week, BuzzFeed captured Cruz on video arguing that his plan was stronger than Trump's because he would not allow those back into the U.S., while Trump's would.
But on the actual act of deportation, Cruz is taking a softer tact. 
""We don't have any system that knocks on the doors of every person in America,"" Cruz told Tapper. ""We also don't have people going door-to-door looking for murderers. We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement.""
Cruz indicated that he would only deport those who are apprehended, such as those who commit crimes or are caught by prospective employers without having immigrated legally. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement or Border Patrol agents could also apprehend those along the border.
Cruz's comments come at a time when President Barack Obama is coming under fire from some progressives for his administration's recent deportations of families back to unstable Central American countries. Some Democrats, including Reps. Linda Sanchez and Luis Gutierrez, argue that the families should be regarded as refugees, not immigrants.
For much of the campaign, Cruz has repeatedly declined to outline what he would do with the undocumented immigrants. But as his debate with Marco Rubio on immigration grew more heated, Cruz definitively ruled out a path to legal status and then has slowly offered more details about how he would deport those already here.
Cruz also said he did not believe those convicted of domestic abuse should be allowed to buy a firearm, and added that the White House's reluctance to use the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" -- a decision Cruz ties to political correctness -- has directly caused a loss of life.
 
He also rejected fears of a GOP electoral wipeout in November if he is the nominee, arguing that history makes clear that moderate Republicans have never fared well in presidential elections. 
""Every time we do it we get clobbered,"" Cruz said. ""You know, this is no longer a theory. You know, as they say in the tech world, this has been beta-tested.""",9.2,9.1,61.67,-1.6,CNN,Ted Cruz
32,32,1668,"Behind Ted Cruz’s Campaign Manager, Scorched Earth and Election Victories",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/us/politics/ted-cruz-campaign-manager-jeff-roe.html,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,5.2,6.4,"For weeks, the labels have hung over Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign like dirty laundry: Deceitful. Cynical. Willing to do anything to win.

The attacks from Mr. Cruz’s Republican rivals have challenged his core campaign promises of integrity and conservative purity, cresting on Monday when he dismissed his communications director, Rick Tyler, for spreading a misleading video about Marco Rubio’s views on the Bible.

“There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom,” a Rubio spokesman said, “that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty.”

The episode threatened to tarnish Mr. Cruz’s brand. But not his campaign manager’s.

As Mr. Cruz has elbowed into the top tier of candidates, his campaign has conspicuously reflected the brand of its principal architect: Jeff Roe, an operative with a reputation for scorching earth, stretching truths and winning elections.

“When you win campaigns,” Mr. Cruz said last month of the man he hired, “the people that lose tend to be unhappy about it.”

Mr. Roe’s home state, Missouri, teems with people who were made unhappy by him.

At 45, with lumbering swagger and drawling parables culled from the family farm, Mr. Roe has steered Mr. Cruz’s onetime long-shot presidential bid into contention.

Mr. Roe’s message has been consistent: Mr. Cruz is the most conservative candidate. His turnout operation is perhaps without peer. He all but guaranteed victory in Iowa, boasting to disbelieving reporters that they would be wasting their time to prepare articles on a Cruz loss.

It was Mr. Roe who hired Mr. Tyler to be the Texas senator’s campaign spokesman. (In an interview this month, Mr. Tyler said he had “learned a lot” from Mr. Roe. “Jeff wins,” Mr. Tyler said, adding, “I don’t think anything we’ve done is underhanded or deceptive or anything like that.”)

But back home, Mr. Roe’s allies and opponents alike have seen a familiar imprint in the Cruz campaign’s recent exploits, which have included a Photoshopped image of Mr. Rubio and the misleading suggestion, on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that Ben Carson was leaving the race.

There was the time, in 2006, when Mr. Roe ran an ad flashing “XXX” to highlight a 63-year-old, wheelchair-using congressional candidate’s former employer’s association with Penthouse magazine. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.

Long before Mr. Cruz tweaked Mr. Trump’s “New York values,” Mr. Roe condemned the “San Francisco-style values” of another opponent in a 2008 ad featuring an ostentatiously dressed black man dancing with two women. Some criticized the spot as racist and homophobic. Mr. Roe’s candidate won.

He was among the first local operatives to tail opponents with camera-wielding trackers and, a decade ago, to investigate the social media pages of candidates and their children.

He has been known to quote Gandhi and ran a blog that trafficked in sometimes-sourced political gossip.

“Jeff Roe does not know the difference between fact and fiction,” said Joe Brazil, a county councilman in Missouri who unsuccessfully sued Mr. Roe for defamation after a 2006 blog post days before Mr. Brazil’s primary in a State Senate race.

The item focused on a sad event from Mr. Brazil’s youth, when, at 17, he killed a classmate in a dump-truck accident. Mr. Roe’s post suggested Mr. Brazil had consumed “quite a few beers.” But Mr. Brazil had not been drinking, the police said, and was not charged.

After watching coverage of the Iowa caucuses from his home in Augusta, Mo., Mr. Brazil said he tried to reach the Carson campaign, hoping to offer a history lesson.

“How could they be surprised?” he asked.

In interviews, Mr. Roe’s clients and current colleagues vigorously defended his ethics. He has helped elect or re-elect 41 members of Congress, six senators and five governors. Surely, supporters say, hurt feelings are to be expected.

“Jeff Roe likes to win,” said Representative Martha E. McSally of Arizona, who won her seat in 2014 by 167 votes.

“Jeff is very intimidating, and he kind of likes that,” said Rod Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker.

“Sometimes he makes people a little bit squeamish,” said Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, Mr. Roe’s mentor. “It is what it is.”

Mr. Cruz’s first experience with Mr. Roe came during his Senate run in Texas in 2012. Mr. Roe’s firm, working for Mr. Cruz’s opponent, produced a flier attacking Mr. Cruz’s legal work for a Chinese company. It made an impression, though Mr. Cruz won.

Mr. Roe, who declined to be interviewed, was quick to establish a distinctive culture at Mr. Cruz’s headquarters in Houston. Top aides were required to move there. (Mr. Roe brought along his wife, Missy, the 2010 winner of the Mrs. Missouri United States pageant; their baby, Remington, named in part for the gun maker; and Mrs. Roe’s parents.)

Meetings begin when he sounds a siren on a bullhorn. They last 10 to 12 minutes, largely because the participants stand. And Roe family wisdom is often heard:

“Get the corn down where the chickens can eat it.”

“If you have a bunch of frogs to eat, eat the biggest one first.”

“When it’s raining soup, put a bowl on your head.”

Though Mr. Roe and Mr. Cruz share a conservative vision, there are differences between the candidate and his message maker.

Mr. Cruz is a practitioner of the filibuster; Mr. Roe is pithy and profane.

Mr. Cruz was an Ivy League debate champion; Mr. Roe worked on his family’s hog farm before joining the National Guard at 17, training with howitzers.

Mr. Cruz tracks his daily exercise habits on a Fitbit; Mr. Roe is built like a baseball umpire, which was once his dream job, and he chews Red Man Golden Blend tobacco, holstering a plastic soda bottle as a spittoon.

Mr. Roe started in politics in 1994, working on Mr. Graves’s election to the State Senate. But umpiring remained a passion. He practiced calling third strikes in the office, using a flourish he called “the chain saw.” He was once heckled at a high school game by the Hall of Famer Whitey Herzog, whose grandson was pitching.

In 1996, he was invited to major league umpiring school. He declined, reluctantly.

“In the back of his mind, he still wonders, would I have made a great umpire?” Mr. Graves said.

When Mr. Graves reached Congress, Mr. Roe became his chief of staff, occasionally earning the ire of the Bush White House. At one administration briefing for the Missouri delegation around 2002, Mr. Roe took issue with an agricultural proposal.

“That’s just bad politics,” he said.

A voice behind Mr. Roe objected. Mr. Roe pressed on, according to several people who recalled the scene, without bothering to face the man.

“That’s just completely out of touch without the reality of Missouri politics,” he repeated.

He was talking to Karl Rove.

In 2005, Mr. Roe left Washington to start a political consulting firm in Missouri. His first presidential work was for Mike Huckabee in 2008; in 2012, he consulted for Rick Perry.

But as Mr. Roe prepared to manage his first presidential bid for Mr. Cruz last February, he faced new scrutiny at home. Days after he ran a radio ad mocking the physical appearance of Tom Schweich, a primary candidate for Missouri governor, by comparing him to Barney Fife, Mr. Schweich committed suicide.

Peers said Mr. Schweich had faced many demons; he also thought the chairman of the state’s Republican Party had falsely spread word that he was Jewish. But some Missouri leaders viewed the ad as a last straw, casting Mr. Roe as the avatar of a toxic campaign culture.

“Politics has gone so hideously wrong,” John C. Danforth, the state’s former three-term United States senator, said as he eulogized Mr. Schweich.

Mr. Roe has expressed condolences to Mr. Schweich’s family and horror at the death, but he betrayed little regret for the ad itself.

“I live in the windshield,” he told The New Republic. “I don’t live in the rearview mirror.”

Such has been his response through the years, more or less, to questions of whether his tactics were fair or foul.

Still, colleagues and even opponents have said Mr. Roe is capable of introspection, of inspiring loyalty and, among competitors, of engendering respect.

Mr. Jetton, the former Missouri House speaker, said he had long since lost touch with Mr. Roe, a friend-turned-adversary, when Mr. Jetton was arrested and charged with assault in 2009, eventually pleading guilty and being placed on probation; in 2010, he faced a grand jury investigation over questions of bribery, though he was not indicted.

Out of the blue, Mr. Jetton received a text from Mr. Roe. “He said, ‘Hey, politics is one thing, but this kind of stuff, you don’t wish for anybody,’ ” Mr. Jetton recalled. “I don’t know that I would have done that for him.”",6.4,5.2,77.23,0.0,The New York Times,Ted Cruz

Place: Oelwein, Iowa (population: 6,415)

Site: Luigi’s Restaurant, with a model cannon, a disco ball and a giant painting of a possibly Italian coastline

Mood: Amore, with Cruz lawn signs

Food: Uncle Dominic’s Italian Beef Dinner, Luigi’s Tour of Italy, Steak Vesuvius

Tough love: Mr. Cruz, whose older daughter, Caroline, is the frequent subject of gentle stump speech teasing, had begun an anecdote about the 7-year-old when a baby began crying. “She makes us do that a lot,” Mr. Cruz said.

Highlight: “Would it kill Republicans to crack a joke?” Mr. Cruz asked, describing how the party could better appeal to young voters. “Actually, I think some of them, it might.”

Mr. Cruz has had so such qualms this trip.

He recalled for the crowd a series of posters, unaffiliated with his campaign, that had appeared in Los Angeles. They depicted the candidate shirtless (with eight-pack abs), heavily tattooed and smoking a cigarette. “I noticed a glaring error,” Mr. Cruz said, echoing his campaign’s response at the time. “I don’t smoke cigarettes.”

54,54,1994,Ted Cruz's conventional campaign to win Iowa,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/02/politics/ted-cruz-iowa-caucuses-2016/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.1,11.2,"Jefferson, Iowa (CNN) In the waning days before the Iowa caucuses, Ted Cruz, almost always the unflappable performer, began to grow wistful.
""The wild rollercoaster ride we've had for the last year is going to be over,"" the Texas senator told one crowd. 
""It has been a bit of a circus,"" he added.
Faced with the Donald Trump Circus, Cruz went with an old-school Iowa strategy: Visit early. Invest in retail. Organize pastors. Tend to homeschoolers. Win the two big nods. Get outside of Des Moines.
Despite Trump's unconventional campaign, and attacks from the billionaire that included questioning Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his being born in Canada, unaligned operatives until the last moments here remained certain that the core of Iowa caucus politics had not changed, despite Trump's unconventional campaign. 
""Iowa has sent notice,"" Cruz said Monday night, ""that the Republican nominee of the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment, will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force, where all sovereignty resides in our nation, by we the people, the American people.""
Cruz's team, basking in victory, projected more confidence than ever before that a strong showing in New Hampshire was within reach. Spokesman Rick Tyler pointed to Cruz's cash on hand, lapping the field by a considerable margin, and said it would put Cruz in a far better position than Marco Rubio and others in the Granite State -- even as they conceded Rubio now entered with momentum.

It was a victory set into motion two and a half years ago, when Cruz first touched down at the Des Moines Marriott -- only six months after he had been sworn into the Senate. 
Cruz was known at the time for ideological purity -- not evangelical fervor -- but over the next few years, he would add to his Christian image, citing Scripture repeatedly in barns and convenience stores as he became more and more tailor-made for Iowa Republicans.
On that first trip here in August 2013, he met with a network of influential Iowa pastors, the same group he returned to last Monday, just a week before clergymen like them would help decide his fate. And he built his own network of evangelical pastors, recruiting one chief in each county and integrating them into a state leadership team that dwarfed other candidates' in size. 
For much of 2015, Cruz visited Iowa consistently, but not overwhelmingly. He thumbed his nose at GOP rivals who essentially moved to the state in search of lightning strike. But he invested in face time, lingering late on a baseball diamond the day of the gay marriage decision in June and at a high-profile evangelical forum in November on one particularly long Iowa day.
And he deliberately and conscientiously identified, courted and landed the two major conservative endorsements behind past Iowa winners, Rep. Steve King and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats, who together have been a road show for Cruz during his visits here over the past two months. 
Their endorsements coincided with Cruz's first major surge in Iowa surveys, culminating with Cruz taking the lead in a Des Moines Register poll in mid-December. With King, he had a provocative spokesperson and a validator in the intense boxing match with the ethanol lobby. With Vander Plaats, he had a networker who could stick around to win over the weary (""It's not that we dislike Santorum,"" he told one voter on the way out the door Saturday.)

Cruz, who had worked hard to tamper expectations, had inadvertently raised them.
""You see the poll?"" Jeff King, the congressman's son, who leads the Cruz super PAC operation here in Iowa, remembers saying to another group official then. ""We're going to have to do well in Iowa.""
Cruz's wager on Iowa stood in contrast to his closest rivals: Trump and Rubio, both of whom are expected to do better in New Hampshire than the Texas senator.
""When he started this thing, he was nowhere,"" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz, standing on a chair as an overflow Cruz crowd surrounded him in Ames. ""I would use this campaign to teach others how to run a race."" 
Monday morning, the Texan's campaign bus ambled to a basketball court in this Greene County town along the Raccoon River to pay heed to Iowa's most revered custom: the ""Full Grassley,"" or the pledge to visit all 99 counties, named for Sen. Chuck Grassley.
""Whatever campaign techniques were used by the campaign that has won, maybe this was the year for that,"" said Jeff Kaufmann, the state's GOP chair. ""But I don't think retail politics, building a political machine and doing all 99 counties is every going to be out of date in this state.""
Trump spent a total of two nights in Iowa hotels, jetting in and out on a private plane for a rally every few days. Rubio blanketed the state in television ads, seeing campaign events as not as efficient a use of time as a Fox News hit or a super PAC media buy. Cruz aides stress that they layered a serious data and paid media campaign onto the infrastructure, but the bedrock of Cruz's bid here was a strategy that was more timeworn than innovative.
Visiting every corner of Iowa doesn't guarantee anything, however. Mick Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who won the 2008 and 2012 GOP caucuses, respectively, barnstormed the state and came away at the bottom of the pack. Huckabee dropped out before the night was over.
""It will say as much about the process as it does about the outcome,"" said Joseph McReynolds, a Cruz fundraiser and activist, as he observed his candidate work a tiny town two days before voting.
Up to the final hours in Iowa, Cruz's team maintained a sense of serenity, believing that the outcome's fate was largely out of their hands. Their voters would turn out. The big question that would decide the race was whether Trump's would -- and that was not in the Cruz campaign's control. 

There was considerable worry among Cruz allies and donors that their candidate made the same mistake that bedeviled previous Iowa losers: that he peaked too early. 
Cruz began a slow rise in Iowa polls in mid-October, but by the time he topped them in early January, he had invited the scorn of as many as seven outside groups, and nearly every candidate, including Trump, who was raising scornful questions about Cruz's eligibility to be president.
In addition to Trump's intense trolling and prodding in television interviews, Twitter and other free media, Cruz's campaign estimates that the senator was pummeled by $8 million in attack ads last month.
And some allies and donors concede that those weeks -- rather than days -- on defense took its toll, including concerns pushed by the state's ethanol lobby, who led voters to badger Cruz at nearly every town hall in the homestretch of the Iowa campaign. Supporters differ on the number of points shaved by the ethanol offensive, but they admit it broke through.
Some friends, in retrospect, say the campaign could have been more aggressive toward Trump and earlier. Yet most argue that avoiding Trump's scorn was the closest thing the campaign had to a masterstroke -- nearly every candidate who attacked Trump, of course, crashed.
It was a calculation they never thought they'd have to make. Cruz's win involved a fair amount of luck: Many of the candidates once likely to be top rivals here -- whether it was Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- fizzled entirely. When asked in June about the candidate competing with him most prominently in the evangelical lane, Cruz pointed to a candidate who ended up flirting with invisibility and dropped out Monday night: Mike Huckabee. 
In the final moments, an old threat reappeared: Rubio. Trump had pulled away in some early polls, and Rubio began to inch up in some public polls. Cruz's super PACs, both weary Rubio's rise but also seeing his supporters as soft, began to target him aggressively. The campaign reassigned all of its advertising in the final days to hold off Rubio, once a vanquished opponent, instead.
John Thompson, an unaligned Iowa GOP central committee member, said Cruz undoubtedly faded in the final weeks here. But the fundamentals of Cruz's bid, he said, charted a new Iowa path.
""He took the best out of every textbook that's ever been written,"" Thompson said, ""and I think he made a new game.""",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN,Ted Cruz

The ad features a narrator who says of Trump, ""He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for,” as images show people streaming across a border fence. 
PolitiFact said the footage comes from the Italian television network RepubblicaTV, which posted video on May 3, 2015 of Moroccans crossing the border into the Spanish city of Melilla. 
""Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over 'our southern border.' However, the footage used to support this point actually shows African migrants streaming over a border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla, more than 5,000 miles away.

But the Trump campaign defended the ad, the candidate's first TV ad of the 2016 cycle. 
In a statement to Fox News on Monday, Trump’s campaign said the use of the footage was ""intentional and selected to demonstrate the severe impact of an open border and the very real threat Americans face if we do not immediately build a wall and stop illegal immigration.""
""The biased main stream media doesn’t understand, but Americans who want to protect their jobs and their families do,"" the statement continued.
