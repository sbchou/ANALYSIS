The WABE 90.1 poll of 400 Georgians who said they were going to vote in the March 1 Republican primary found 41% of those surveyed supported Mr. Trump; 18% backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and 15% were behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. About 8% supported Dr. Ben Carson and 7% supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The poll found Mr. Trump leading substantially among various groups, including self-described evangelical voters, conservatives and Republicans who consider themselves liberal or moderate.
Researchers conducted the Internet polling, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points, from Feb. 22 to Feb. 24. The poll follows several other recent polls that showed Mr. Trump leading in Georgia by at least 9 points, with Mr. Cruz coming in second and Mr. Rubio in third place. Support for Mr. Kasich and Mr. Carson was in the single digits in those polls.",5.2,4.1,80.28,0.0,The Wall Street Journal,Donald Trump
86,86,1329,Video suggests Clinton shared info that 'would never be on an unclassified system' normally,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/v6YhQb7Zjpg/video-suggests-clinton-shared-info-that-would-never-be-on-unclassified-system-normally.html,clinton,fox,Foreign Policy/National Security,13.4,11.2,"A 2013 video, obtained exclusively by Fox News, raises fresh questions about how Hillary Clinton handled sensitive information at the State Department. 
In the video, veteran diplomat Wendy Sherman reveals that in the interest of speed, Clinton and her aides would share information that ""would never be on an unclassified system"" normally. 
The questions surround a 2013 speech in which Sherman compared the technology differences between serving at the State Department in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Obama. 
""Now we have BlackBerries, and it has changed the way diplomacy is done,"" Sherman, who was undersecretary of state at the time, said in the 2013 on-camera remarks. ""Things appear on your BlackBerries that would never be on an unclassified system. But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.""
Clinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. 
The Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. 
In Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. 
The secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. 
""So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,"" said Sherman. ""To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.""
The Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.
Previous email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. 
The State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. 
The conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves ""foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,"" so it was born classified when the emails were created. 
""Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,"" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. ""This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.""
A Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. 
The polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important.

70,70,1136,First Draft: Digital Ads for Hillary Clinton Focus on Young Women and Equal Pay,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/digital-ads-for-hillary-clinton-focus-on-young-women-and-equal-pay/,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,9.5,9.6,"Two outside groups supportive of Hillary Clinton’s campaign are running their first ads as part of a multimillion dollar advertising effort hoping to energize the millennial female voting base.

Priorities USA, the “super PAC” supporting Hillary Clinton, and Emily’s List, the political action committee that works to elect Democratic women, have partnered on the campaign, which they said will run through the general election. They are expected to spend roughly $20 million on the effort.

The first element of this campaign will be a $500,000 digital ad buy, in partnership with the American Federation of Teachers, which will run in early states with a focus on Texas, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.

“Right now, young women are some of the most dedicated and active progressives this country has ever seen,” Denise Feriozzi, the deputy executive director of Emily’s list, said in a statement. “And we have the candidate to match this moment.”

Titled “Give ‘Em Hill,” the campaign will cite Mrs. Clinton’s record and her fight for equal pay for women. The content revolves around a website and two 15-second pre-roll ads that will run on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and elsewhere online, with a casual style tailored for the millennial audience. 

“When you find out that bro who has your same job gets paid more than you,” a woman says in the ad, “you give ’em Hill,” before a Vote for Hillary on March 1 title card closes the ad.

The effort comes as Mrs. Clinton has struggled to connect with younger voters, who have flocked to Senator Bernie Sanders’s campaign. In New Hampshire, 79 percent of women under 30 voted for Mr. Sanders over Mrs. Clinton, according to exit poll data.",9.6,9.5,60.65,0.0,The New York Times,Hillary Clinton

Fox News: “The FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email as secretary of state has expanded to look at whether the possible ‘intersection’ of Clinton Foundation work and State Department business may have violated public corruption laws, three intelligence sources not authorized to speak on the record told Fox News. This track is in addition to the focus on classified material found on Clinton’s personal server. ‘The agents are investigating the possible intersection of Clinton Foundation donations, the dispensation of State Department contracts and whether regular processes were followed,’ one source said.”

Wait. What? - WSJ: “In [a recently released] 2011 email exchange about faxing a talking points document, the former secretary of state instructed aide Jake Sullivan to take a secure fax and ‘turn [it] into nonpaper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure’ if technical difficulties with the secure fax system persisted…‘I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture,’ the Democratic presidential candidate said Sunday on CBS. ‘But, oftentimes, there’s a lot of information that isn’t at all classified. So, whatever information can appropriately be transmitted unclassified often was...’ Mrs. Clinton said Sunday that the request to her staffer didn’t amount to an order to violate laws on handling classified material, and said the email was never sent in any case.”

Hillary calls for taxpayer funding of abortions - At a Planned Parenthood endorsement rally for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee called for an end to the 40-year-old ban on taxpayer funds for abortion. The so-called Hyde Amendment, passed in 1976, is the long-standing compromise between pro-life and pro-choice lawmakers that restricts federally funded abortion cases only to those of rape, incest and life of the mother. Over time, this has grown to include government health programs like Medicaid and Obamacare. At the rally, Clinton said she believes Planned Parenthood, America’s largest abortion provider, should be “fully funded” citing that the measure discriminates against low-income women. The group took in over $500 million from taxpayers in 2014 for non-abortion activities.

Sanders strengthens in Iowa, N.H. - WSJ: “ Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are deadlocked in both Iowa and New Hampshire three weeks before voting begins in the 2016 presidential race, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds. The Republican primary contest also remains tight in Iowa. Mrs. Clinton holds a slim, 48%-to-45% lead over the Vermont senator among likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, the survey found. Mr. Sanders edges the former secretary of state among likely primary voters in New Hampshire, 50% to 46%. Both leads are within the polling margins of error.”

KOCH GROUP UNVEILS OBAMACARE RATE TRACKER
Freedom Partners is releasing a 2016 Obamacare Premium Increase Tracker today, ahead of President Obama’s State of the Union speech. The tracker shows the average health care premium increases in each state on the individual marketplace for 2016. Freedom Partners’ policy team calculates that premiums on the individual marketplace increased in 49 out of 50 states. In most states, costs went up by double-digits. Seventeen states will see premium increases of 20 percent of more, the group says.

[Brackets Obama - Rather than giving her old boss a clear media lane for his last big speech as president, Hillary Clinton is doing a sit-down interview with CNN that’s set to air Tuesday, just ahead of President Obama’s final State of the Union Address.]

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE…
Saying you liked the music of David Bowie would be like saying you liked Chinese food. There are so many kinds and so many variations within the kinds that there is something for everyone. Glam, rock, Motown-style soul, dancehall, the deep dark depths of Berlin, electronica, pure pop, proto-punk, funk, epic poetry and even the coveted goblin disco king demographic. That means that there is room enough for everyone to have their own favorite song. As music lovers of all kinds mourn Bowie’s passing, his remarkable catalogue is a reminder of perhaps one thing above all others: The real luxury of career success is the chance to take risks. RIP.

GOP POWER INDEX: HAND IT TO KASICH
Unlike another presidential contender, the name of John Kasich’s book would never be “Gifted Hands.” But with a signature karate chop or his patented Frankenstein, the Ohio governor is slashing his way into contention in New Hampshire.

Running as high as second in some new polling, Kasich seems to be really making his stand. Is he probably just Huntsmaning? Yes. Would that be consequential? Yes.

State and national polling shows that the third coming of Chris Christie is not upon us. After weeks of media speculation that the long-dormant chances of the New Jersey governor were going erupt in a riot of electoral possibilities, there’s no evidence of it.

Same goes for Jeb Bush, whose remaining loyalists say is now eying South Carolina as his real last stand. Bless his heart.

The name of the game for Kasich, Christie and Bush is to beat Marco Rubio. Anywhere. Anyhow. He runs best against Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups and, booties or not, seems to be starting to solidify his place.

New Hampshire, with a primary open to Democrats and independents, and an electorate more liberal and secular than the rest of the early voting-states presents the best chance to knock down Rubio.

Aside from an iron-clad consistency that Christie seems to lack and an energy that Bush cannot bring, Kasich is also the kind of Republican that attracts Democrats. Like Trump, he has true crossover appeal.

While Rubio has been sparring with Christie and Bush, he may fight his last round in New Hampshire with Kasich.

Cruz rejects Trump’s ‘deportation force’ - CNN: “Texas Sen. Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN’s Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump. … Cruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on ‘State of the Union’ that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S. ‘No, I don’t intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That’s not how we enforce the law for any crime,’ Cruz [said.]”

Trump’s new birther gusto - WaPo: “After days of coyly raising questions about Ted Cruz’s eligibility to be president, given that he was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father, Donald Trump let his audience weigh in at a rally Sunday afternoon. ‘Is he a natural-born citizen?’ the Republican White House hopeful asked several thousand gathered in a Reno ballroom. Members of the crowd shouted back, ‘No!’ ‘I don’t know,’ Trump said. ‘Honestly, we don’t know. Who the hell knows.’ Cruz was Trump’s No. 1 target during the 65-minute event, revealing just how much of a threat the Republican senator from Texas has become to the front-runner. Before the rally started, Bruce Springsteen's ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ blared, a new edition to Trump’s playlist.”

Trump signs Huntsman group’s pledge - AP: “No Labels, formed after the 2010 midterm elections, is asking candidates to embrace four broad goals related to job creation, the federal budget, energy independence and entitlements, promote them in the campaign and promise to work with a bipartisan group in Congress on at least one of them within 30 days of taking office…On Monday, the group’s leaders are announcing the six who stepped up: Democrat Martin O'Malley, and Republicans Ben Carson, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rand Paul and Donald Trump.”

ABC drops debate partner at Trump’s behest - WFXT: “Donald Trump announced Sunday that he had the New Hampshire Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate on Feb. 6. Politico reports that ABC cut their partnership with the paper, the largest newspaper in New Hampshire, a source citing a strained relationship, caused by the front page editorials about Donald Trump. Trump is taking credit for the end of the relationship, saying the paper’s behavior has been ‘highly unethical’ and it has endorsed a candidate who can’t win. On Nov. 28, the paper endorsed Gov. Chris Christie.”

Rubio makes major ad push in Iowa - DMR: “Marco Rubio is poised to dominate Iowa’s television airwaves with about 7,000 ads scheduled to run from Jan. 1 until caucus day — an effort that accounts for more than one-third of all political ads slated to air during that time. The purchases on Rubio's behalf make up more than half of the $9.4 million in total spending for ads that are scheduled to air across the state during the final month of the caucus campaign.”

Despite past quotes, Christie denies Planned Parenthood donations - WSJ: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied Sunday that he has given money to Planned Parenthood, hitting back at a claim by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. ‘I never donated to Planned Parenthood,’ Mr. Christie told CBS on Face the Nation…On Fox Business last week, Mr. Rubio highlighted positions that he said aligned Mr. Christie with President Barack Obama [including Planned Parenthood donations]…A 2012 book on the governor – ‘Chris Christie: The Inside Story of His Rise to Power’ — recalls an incident in the mid-90s where Mr. Christie opposed county funding for Planned Parenthood on financial grounds, even though he said he supported it ideologically. ‘I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution,’ he said, according to the book. When asked about the apparent conflict with the statement from decades ago, a Christie spokeswoman said: ‘The governor didn’t donate to Planned Parenthood.’”

POWER PLAY: IOWA INTRICACIES
As Donald Trump continues to dig into Ted Cruz, the competition for Iowa is kicking into high gear. But a caucus is a lot more involved than going to the polling booth and checking a ballot. Will the attacks incentivize Trump supporters to caucus for him? DMR’s Brianne Pfannenstiel is covering Trump in the state and gives Chris Stirewalt her take. WATCH HERE.

IT’S IN THE SELF-HELP SECTION
Independent: “Among the documents and publications held at the UN’s main library in New York is a book called ‘Immunity of Heads of State and State Officials for International Crimes.’ Published in 2014 and written by Ramona Pedretti, a Swiss legal expert, the book turned out to be the most popular among UN diplomats last year…”

64,64,1298,"The Ad Campaign: In New Ad, Hillary Clinton Sums Up Her Case for Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/in-new-ad-hillary-clinton-sums-up-her-case-for-iowa-and-new-hampshire-democrats.html,clinton,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,7.9,9.2,"Packed with biography, campaign promises and attacks on her Republican rivals, a new 60-second ad from Hillary Clinton, titled “This House,” offers what sounds like her closing argument to Iowa Democrats, asking them to vote for her on Feb. 1. A similar ad with a different ending will be shown in New Hampshire.

Opening on the White House, the ad shows a sweltering industrial plant, a fighter taking off from an aircraft carrier and a family of four sitting down to dinner. “The person who lives here,” a male narrator intones, “has to solve problems as big as the world and as small as your kitchen table.”

Viewers are taken on a quick tour of Mrs. Clinton’s extended career in public service: surrounded by children as first lady, when she “helped get health care for eight million kids”; as a senator from New York, standing grim-faced in a trench coat amid the debris at ground zero, where, the ad says, she “helped a city rise again”; and speaking soberly to an attentive President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as the voice-over says she has “stared down hostile leaders around the world.” She is seen on the campaign trail and in the Situation Room with President Obama as the ad calls her the “one candidate for president who has everything it takes to do every part of the job.”

The ad rattles off Mrs. Clinton’s touchstone promises: to defend Social Security and Medicare against privatization, protect Planned Parenthood from shutdown, “take on the gun lobby” and “finally get equal pay for women.” Clips of a shouting Donald J. Trump and of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas aiming an assault weapon at a gun range symbolize the threat as the narrator says Mrs. Clinton will “stop the Republicans from ripping all our progress away.”

It closes with Mrs. Clinton, back in October, assuring Iowa Democrats, “I’m listening to you, I’m fighting for you, and with your support, I’m going to deliver,” as viewers are urged to “caucus for Hillary.”

An entire candidacy boiled down to a minute. With its heavy focus on foreign policy and experience in a crisis, the ad plays up ways in which Mrs. Clinton’s résumé compares favorably with that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her unnamed Democratic rival. The references to gun control offer a reminder of her recent attacks on Mr. Sanders’s record on that issue. And she returns to women’s rights, on which she began her campaign. To “keep America safe and build a stronger economy,” the ad sums up, “Hillary’s the choice.”

In 2008, Mrs. Clinton was criticized for what some saw as an overstatement of her role in enacting the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. But this ad gets it right: She was a driving force on the bill within her husband’s administration, aiding the efforts of Edward M. Kennedy and others who led the fight for it in the Senate.

Iowa broadcast markets.

It feels as if it’s much longer than 60 seconds, and that is a good thing: The ad seeks to give Mrs. Clinton’s strengths the feeling of overwhelming force while conveying that only she has what it takes to meet the demands of the presidency and to defend what Democrats hold dear.",9.2,7.9,70.13,0.0,The New York Times,Hillary Clinton
