10,10,1477,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Promises to Keep Pressing the Campaign,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-promises-to-keep-pressing-the-campaign/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.7,10.0,"BOSTON — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed on Monday night that no matter the outcome of the Super Tuesday races, his campaign would continue to rally voters against a political establishment that is largely backing his rival, Hillary Clinton.

Mr. Sanders, standing next to a chartered plane here, said he would “likely” win Vermont’s vote, and also felt good about his chances for winning the most delegates in Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts. He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.

“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”

Mr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. 

“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”

Still, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.

“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote. They do that very well.”

Mr. Sanders went on to repeat criticisms of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to several industries and to cast himself as a candidate more interested in reforming campaign finance laws and dealing with income inequality. To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay’s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for “The Big Short,” a movie about the failure of the banking industry.

“As Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. 

Mr. Sanders also said that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he didn’t think “real change” comes from someone taking money from such industries and that instead, such change would come from millions of people demanding “a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent.”",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,The New York Times
50,50,1832,First on CNN: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to endorse Cruz for president,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/24/politics/ted-cruz-greg-abbott-texas-endorsement/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,10.3,10.4,"(CNN) Texas Gov. Greg Abbott will endorse Wednesday one of his political disciples, Ted Cruz, giving the Lone State senator  his highest-ranking political endorsement thus far in the presidential race.
Abbott will formally back Cruz at an event Wednesday at 1 p.m. in Houston, campaign officials said, just six days before what is expected to be a competitive race with Donald Trump in Texas. Although not unexpected, the nod from Abbott is the clearest sign yet that the Texas Republican establishment is backing their freshman senator in his presidential ambitions.
""After 8 years of relentless attacks on our values from this White House, it's our duty as Texas conservatives to support a leader we can trust to restore our values and move this country forward,"" Abbott said in a video message out Wednesday. ""That's why I'm supporting Ted Cruz for president."" 
Abbott will also quickly become the most senior political leader to back Cruz's bid. No other governor has endorsed him, nor has any senator -- including the state's senior senator, John Cornyn.
A year ago, who Abbott would endorse in the Republican race -- if he would at all -- was one of the hottest questions in Texas politics. But as the field winnowed and the other candidates with ties to Texas -- former Gov. Rick Perry, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina -- dropped out, it became increasingly clear that Abbott would choose Cruz, the state's rising political star.
Abbott and Cruz share a hardline position on the governor's top national priority: strengthening the nation's border and rooting out illegal immigration. But their connection is also personal: When Abbott was the state attorney general under Perry, Cruz was Abbott's solicitor general, arguing cases on behalf of the state before the U.S. Supreme Court.
Cruz has repeatedly spoken glowingly of Abbott on the campaign trail, frequently recalling the charge that Abbott gave him -- to find constitutional fights where the Texas Attorney General could get involved, and to wage them.
Abbott, along with dozens of state legislators and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, is expected to be a top surrogate for Cruz in the closing days of the Texas primary. Struggling to convince observers that he can do as well in the southern states on March 1 as he once hoped to, Cruz's team is raising the stakes for his performance back home, pointing to delegate-rich Texas as a place that can put him back on even footing in the delegate race with his rivals.
But the state is not seen as a lock: Trump has spoken of beating Cruz in Texas, and the super PAC backing Marco Rubio has invested $1.5 million in this state this week to try and embarrass Cruz by weakening him back at home.",10.4,10.3,58.62,0.0,CNN
77,77,1244,Political fallout for Clinton after North Korea's nuke test,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/politics/north-korea-nuclear-test-clinton-trump/index.html,clinton,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,11.1,10.0,"Washington (CNN) North Korea might not be able to reach the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon yet, but the political fallout from its claimed hydrogen bomb test is here already.
Even before the shockwaves of the 5.1 temblor triggered by Tuesday's test wore off, Hillary Clinton was fighting off a volley of Republican attacks, GOP presidential candidates were talking tough and Donald Trump jumped on a chance to chastise China.
The episode was a fresh indication of the challenge that Clinton faces in running for the White House on her record as secretary of state, which makes it impossible for her to escape deficiencies in President Barack Obama's national security legacy.
""If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy,"" crowed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is styling himself as a foreign policy expert. He argued that U.S. enemies were ""taking advantage of Obama's weakness.""
Former business executive Carly Fiorina, another outspoken GOP hawk, also slammed Clinton, arguing that the volatile Stalinist state had been spurred to up the nuclear ante by Obama administration concessions granted to Iran in return for a freezing of its nuclear program.
""Of course, North Korea would conduct a nuclear test after watching Iran willfully violate an agreement they just made without consequence of any kind from this administration,"" Fiorina said in a statement. ""North Korea is yet another Hillary Clinton foreign policy failure.""

There's no question that as the administration in possession of the North Korea nuclear problem, the Obama White House -- and by extension Clinton -- are in a political bind.
Their failure to turn back North Korea's development of its nuclear arsenal is manifest in its flurry of nuclear tests and ballistic missile engineering over the last seven years. But there is no obvious way to deter a nation that does not respond to the traditional carrots and sticks of diplomacy.
""What we've also seen on the part of North Koreans is an apparent willingness to accept international isolation,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday, pointing out that North Korea already had a nuclear bomb when Obama took office.
Clinton's campaign is working to absolve her of blame for past failures and to turn her vulnerability into a strength. So the former secretary of state offered the most detailed plan of any of the candidates on how to respond.
Addressing multiple audiences, as a commander-in-chief must, Clinton accused North Korea of playing nuclear blackmail and ""bullying,"" offered reassurance to U.S. allies and then turned on her Republican foes, questioning their capacity to handle the situation.
The former top U.S. diplomat also defended her own work on North Korea, saying she had been responsible for getting Russia and China on board for the ""strongest sanctions yet"" against Pyongyang while she was at the State Department.
And she fired a warning at her Republican adversaries, particularly seeming to target the brazen Trump and youthful Rubio.
""Threats like this are yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election. We cannot afford reckless, imprudent publicity stunts that risk war. We need a commander-in-chief with the experience and judgement to deal with a dangerous North Korea on Day One.""

Republican front-runner Trump also tried to turn the North Korea explosion to his own political advantage, further increasing the heat on China after his accusations of fleecing the United States on economic issues.
""China has total control, believe me, they say they don't. They have total control over North Korea and China should solve that problem,"" Trump said on Fox News.
He continued, ""If they don't solve the problem, we should make trade very difficult for China because we are, believe it, we are holding China up. They're taking so much money. They're draining our country, and they're toying with us with North Korea.""
But while China might be the key player in North Korea, the Obama and George W. Bush administrations repeatedly pressed Beijing to rein in its de-facto ally but did not shift the underlying dynamics of the standoff.
 
In recent years there have been signs of increasing impatience from Beijing toward Pyongyang, but China's concerns on the issue have not changed -- namely a reluctance to seeing a unified Korean peninsula allied with the United States and a potentially destabilizing flow of millions of refugees into its territory should the regime collapse.
Rubio pressed home his attack on Wednesday in Iowa, offering his own plan. He called on North Korea to be put back on the list of state-sponsors of terrorism, for new sanctions on its leaders, a hike in U.S. military spending and reinvigorated alliances with U.S. Asian allies and a renewed commitment to missile defense.
""If trends continue, this lunatic will possess a missile and a warhead capable of reaching the U.S., and we better be capable of shooting it down before it gets anywhere near us,"" he warned. ""We need to invest and re-commit to that again.""
Another GOP candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, used the nuclear test to argue that bad things happen when America has ""withdrawn"" from the world.

However, so intractable has the North Korea problem been that it seemed doubtful that any of the approaches outlined by potential next presidents would work. As is often the case when foreign policy mixes with campaign politics, it can prove easier for candidates to grandstand than frame grand strategy.
Washington has tried punishment and inducements repeatedly with North Korea and has failed to change the calculations of a secretive, repressive regime that uses its pariah status to entrench its power at home and is prepared to let its own people starve rather than offer concessions to Washington.
Bush, for instance, came to office and ended Bill Clinton's policy of engaging the Pyongyang regime. He then toughened his stance by including North Korea in his ""axis of evil.""
 
But the strategy failed as North Korea restarted plutonium reactors frozen under a 1994 deal with the Clinton administration, while the administration accused it of building a separate uranium program. Pyongyang ultimately conducted a nuclear test in 2006.
By the end of his administration, Bush saw six-party international talks with the North Koreans as the best way to defuse the nuclear standoff.
Obama has also tried the hardline approach. 
In 2010, during a visit to Seoul, he addressed the leaders of North Korea directly, warning that their pursuit of nuclear arms denied them dignity and would only lead to more of the same: ""more broken dreams, more isolation.""
And he's used diplomacy, but with no better results. During his time in office, Pyongyang has conducted at least three nuclear tests and a flurry of missile and satellite launches. And unless something dramatic changes, he will bequeath the North Korean nuclear headache to the next president.",9.6,10.7,52.19,-0.4,CNN
27,27,1555,Sanders a prolific Dem fundraiser,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.5,11.6,"Manchester , New Hampshire (CNN) Bernie Sanders complained on the campaign trail Friday that dialing for dollars ""affects your entire being.""
What he didn't mention: The Vermont senator and presidential candidate is a prolific fundraiser himself and has regularly benefited from the Democratic Party apparatus. 
In recent years, Sanders has been billed as one of the hosts for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's retreats for the ""Majority Trust"" -- an elite group of top donors who give more than $30,000 per year -- at Martha's Vineyard in the summer and Palm Beach, Florida, in the winter. CNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011.
The retreats are typically attended by 100 or more donors who have either contributed the annual legal maximum of $33,400 to the DSCC, raised more than $100,000 for the party or both.  
Sanders has based his presidential campaign on a fire-and-brimstone critique of a broken campaign finance system -- and of Hillary Clinton for her reliance on big-dollar Wall Street donors. But Sanders is part of that system, and has helped Democrats court many of the same donors. 
Democratic debate: 6 takeaways
A Democratic lobbyist and donor who has attended the retreats told CNN that about 25% of the attendees there represent the financial sector -- and that Sanders and his wife, Jane, are always present. 
""At each of the events all the senators speak. And I don't recall him ever giving a speech attacking us,"" the donor said. ""While progressive, his remarks were always in the mainstream of what you hear from senators."" 
Sanders' political leanings were well known by the donors who attended the retreats. ""Nobody was more surprised that Bernie was there than the donors were,"" said another Democrat who attended the retreats. 
Hillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton stack late February with fundraisers
But Sanders maintains that members of Congress now spend far too much time making calls seeking campaign contributions -- or ""dialing for dollars,"" he said during a speech at the New England Council's ""Politics and Eggs"" event Friday morning.
""That's what they do. And not only should members who are elected be working for the people, not raising money -- if you think you could simply divide your brain in half, if you're working on unemployment or health care and think, now I've gotta go out and raise money, it affects your entire being,"" he said.

Sanders has been an Independent while in Congress, but has caucused with the Democrats since he was elected to the Senate in 2006, helping them maintain their majority for eight years. 
Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said Sanders has ""raised more money for the Senate Democrats than almost any other member of the Senate Democratic caucus"" because he sees helping the party regain the majority as critical.
""He has in the past written letters and helped Senate Democrats elect Democrats. He thinks that's very important to the country,"" Briggs said.
Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims
He got a hand from the party in 1996, when Rob Engel, then the political director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, pushed a Democratic contender out of the race for the House seat Sanders held as an independent.  
In 2006, when Sanders ran for the Senate, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pumped $37,300 into his race and included him in fundraising efforts for the party's Senate candidates. 
The party also spent $60,000 on ads for Sanders, and contributed $100,000 to the Vermont Democratic Party -- which was behind Sanders even as he ran as an independent.  
Among the DSCC's top contributors that year: Goldman Sachs at $685,000, Citigroup at $326,000, Morgan Stanley at $260,000 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. at $207,000. 
During that 2006 campaign, Sanders attended a fundraiser at the Cambridge, Massachusetts home of Abby Rockefeller -- a member of the same family whose wealth he had one proposed confiscating. 
Two years later, when then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama was being nominated at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, Sanders was among the senators who met with Sen. Chuck Schumer's ""Legacy Circle"" donors who had given the legal maximum to the DSCC five years in a row or $500,000 over their lifetimes. 
He paid dues to the DSCC, too, with his Progressive Voters of America political action committee cutting checks for $30,000 to the group during the 2014 election cycle.  
What 'progressive' means to Hillary Clinton vs. What 'progressive' means to Bernie Sanders

Sanders told the ""Politics and Eggs"" crowd that he favors a public financing system for elections, eliminating campaign contributions entirely. But his presidential campaign, just as Clinton's and Barack Obama's in 2008 and 2012, has chosen to bypass that system, allowing Sanders to raise millions of dollars more. 
He has repeatedly touted his campaign's vast online fundraising apparatus, which has pulled in 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece, Sanders said Friday. 
Pressed by MSNBC moderator Chuck Todd on why he hasn't accepted public financing in Thursday night's debate, Sanders said the system as it exists now is ""a disaster"" and ""very antiquated"" because it limits spending in early-voting primary states. 
""The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work,"" Sanders said.",11.6,11.5,55.58,0.0,CNN
45,45,1949,Takeaways from Ted Cruz's Iowa road trip,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/cruz-iowa-takeaways/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,8.7,10.0,"Strawberry Point, Iowa (CNN) He is the front-runner, and he knows it.
On the surface, Ted Cruz looked as strong as ever during his six-day, 28-county bus tour across the Hawkeye State last week week, filling Christian bookstores and old schoolhouses as he trekked from the Missouri to the Mississippi rivers at a workmanlike pace. He took dozens of shouted questions each day at events not billed as town halls, and reveled in the adoration given to a candidate who badly wants to earn top billing here on February 1. 
His red meat connected. His crowds swelled. His applause never ended.
Read: Cruz rules out 'deportation force' to boot undocumented
He also has, by most accounts, a first-class ground game and as of this Wednesday, a high-powered super PAC operation to fund his message on the airwaves here.
But beneath the surface, Cruz's hold on Iowa is tenuous, a close observation of 15 of his events reveals. He's on the defensive over his ethanol position, has had his religion and citizenship questioned. And there's still plenty of time for the dynamics of the race to shift against him.
Here's what we learned from Cruz's bus tour -- and what can still hold him back in the final three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.

Cruz spent much of the week fielding persistent questions not about his momentum in Iowa, but about his mother's voting history in Canada and whether he was being 100% truthful about his knowledge of what happened north of the border. It was, in the eyes of any political observer, off message.
Read: Why Donald Trump may be hoping for a long caucus night in Iowa
The son of a Cuban man and an American woman, most legal experts agree Cruz is a naturally-born U.S. citizen eligible to be commander-in-chief. 
Cruz told CNN's Dana Bash that he's not concerned about the issue. ""Of course not,"" Cruz said. ""Yes, I'm sure. The media, with all due respect, love to engage in silly sideshows. We need to focus on what matters.""
""The legal issue is straightforward,"" he added, calling it a ""non-issue."" ""Listen, the Constitution and the laws of the United States are straightforward. The very first Congress defined the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad as a natural-born citizen.""
Read: Cruz dismisses 'swamp theories' on citizenship
Trump does not appear to see it that way. Although the billionaire has not outright said Cruz is ineligible to be president, he intensified his criticism at two Iowa campaign rallies on Saturday.
""He was born in Canada. I guess his parents voted in Canada,"" Trump said in Clear Lake. ""So if you were born in Canada, immediately it's a little bit of a problem.""
After six months of never veering off the message of unbridled respect for the national GOP front-runner, Cruz this week said that he wouldn't be accepting unsolicited legal advice from him and suggested that Trump is ""panicking"" because of Cruz's recent surge in Iowa polls.
Read: Rubio hits Cruz on immigration, Snowden
""A few weeks ago, everyone in the field was attacking Donald Trump,"" Cruz said time and time again across northern Iowa, barely containing his smile. ""Now, everyone's attacking me. That suggests something's changed."" 
But the most substantive political point came late Friday evening in a basement at Mabe's Pizza in Winneshiek County. It was his sixth stop of the day -- Cruz had more energy than the press corps and senior staff traveling with him -- when a man asked him to directly pitch why he should vote for Cruz over his rival.
""Listen, there is an 'Iowa way' of campaigning and deciding caucuses. I believe the only way to compete and win in the state of Iowa is to come and spend the time asking the voters for their support, looking them in the eye, having the humility to submit yourself to the men and women of this state,"" his voice racing forward and raising in volume. ""And if a candidate is not doing that, that ought to be an indication."" 

At event after event in northern Iowa, Cruz was repeatedly confronted by audience members who lodged emotional, and sometimes agitated, complaints about his record on ethanol and desire to eliminate the Renewable Fuel Standard.
There was the man in the Casey's General Store in Manly who button-holed Cruz and wouldn't let him go until an aide physically moved the senator onto a different voter. There were the farmers who asked, with a pang of concern, whether there was just something about Cruz's position that they must've misheard.
""I'm a corn farmer. I've been following your campaign and I see that you've modified your stance on the RFS,"" Bob Hemesath, a local corn industry leader, asked Cruz in Decorah. ""And in reality, you haven't really modified your stance.""
Cruz nodded. On that, they agreed.
Read: For Ted Cruz, the last voter in the room is the hardest
Cruz has tried to pitch Iowans on other parts of his ethanol policy beyond the RFS, most prominently rolling back an EPA regulation that limits the amount of gasoline that can be in an ethanol blend. But these Iowans that Cruz has tried to win over were rarely convinced by those arguments, which they see as B-list concerns to the RFS that Cruz wants to phase out within five years.
At nearly every stop, Cruz would motion behind him and point at the best validator he could, Dave VanderGreind, an Iowan ethanol magnate who agreed with Cruz's point that the RFS was not the be-all-end-all.  
The campaign wants to keep repeating its message, and when the team was surprised to see no one ask about his position on the RFS in Webster City on Thursday, Rep. Steve King whispered in Cruz's ear.
""Alright, so Steve raised one additional question. He said there may be someone here wondering about ethanol,"" Cruz said. ""So let's talk about that for a second.""

The scourge of Washington Republicans -- he has few friends in the Senate -- and of critics who label him robotic, harsh and grating, Cruz is offering Iowans a look at a kinder, gentler side in the final weeks before voters here decide his fate. It is his campaign's soft sell, its final attempt to show Republicans that he isn't just right on the issues, but decent enough and homely enough to win their vote.
""It's not just smart politics. It's smart relationships,"" said Bob Vander Plaats, who is standing a step behind Cruz at every stop on his bus tour as one of Cruz's top allies in the state. ""You're seeing him being more vulnerable."" 
When a woman in a hotel lobby told Cruz about the death of her son, a veteran who suffered from post-traumatic disorder, the Texas firebrand lowered his voice to something close to a microphoned whisper: ""My mom lost my older brother as an infant,"" he shared.
At Dr. Thomas Gleason's Airplane Hangar in Webster City, he told Edith Verman-Frank, a 76-year-old survivor of two simultaneous stage four cancers, that his mother too was a 15-year breast cancer survivor. Two questions later, Cruz was explaining to Jaci Bagwell that he understand her worries about student loans debt -- he only paid off his $100,000 in debt five years ago.
But Cruz has worked hard over the past seven months to maintain his standing as the most conservative candidate in the field, and his outpourings of empathy have political limits.
When asked in the hotel lobby in Storm Lake by a young, undocumented woman who said she was troubled by Cruz's new plan that he would deport people like her immediately if elected, Cruz showed no pity. 
""Well, listen, I would note if you're a DACA recipient, it means that you were brought here illegally,"" Cruz told her as the room grew silent. ""And violating the laws have consequences.""",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,CNN
