116,116,10,"After GOP establishment 'froze' on Trump, Democrats ready battle plans",http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/donald-trump-democrats-election-2016/index.html,trump,cnn,Campaign Finance,12.3,10.0,"Columbus, Ohio (CNN) As Donald Trump seems poised for a huge night Tuesday, Democrats see his stunning ascent and controversial, celebrity-driven business empire as a golden opportunity. 
""Those bankruptcies screwed a lot of people -- and not just hedge fund yuppies,"" said a top strategist aligned with a pro-Clinton super PAC. ""His idea of 'winning' has involved a lot of bad behavior -- and the victims are exactly the profile of Trump voters: blue-collar whites.""
For months, key campaign operatives inside the Republican Party establishment were supremely confident that Trump would implode long before this moment. Instead, the GOP is now facing an existential crisis not seen in more than a generation as much of the party leadership and many of its top figures are in open revolt against Trump's candidacy heading into Super Tuesday.
The potential liabilities lurking in Trump's background are hardly a secret. The real estate magnate's occasional business failings and colorful personal life have filled the pages of New York tabloids for decades.
Storing its ammunition for the general election, one pro-Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has taken a few jabs at Trump, choosing instead to portray the businessman as a reflection of the Republican Party.
""Trump is no fluke. Nor is he hijacking the Republican Party or the conservative movement,"" wrote Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky in an email to reporters. ""He is, rather, the party's creation, its Frankenstein monster.""
A Trump rival, Marco Rubio, has only recently decided to tap that treasure trove of opposition research. That offensive, however, only began in earnest at last week's Republican debate as Rubio mocked Trump's inheritance and legal troubles facing the real estate academy launched by his the tycoon's vast organization.
The Democrats' looming business boogeyman assault on Trump is nearly identical to the attack leveled at the last GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, whose financial firm Bain Capital was savaged by pro-Obama super PACs over its practice of downsizing manufacturers for profit.
Inside the pro-Clinton super PAC-world, the Republican establishment's miscalculation is viewed as a tactical error of epic proportions.
""Amazing. They just froze,"" the PAC aligned strategist said, requesting anonymity.
No candidacy better illustrates GOP's painful lesson, in the minds of several top GOP advisers, than that of Jeb Bush. 
As Trump delighted in pointing out at every one of his rallies, the former Florida governor and his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, both amassed a war chest capable of annihilating any potential rival. But instead of directing that arsenal at Trump, Bush and his allies chose to target fellow establishment figures, especially Rubio.
""The civilized world raised an army and entrusted it to Right to Rise PAC,"" said Stuart Stevens, Romney's former campaign manager. ""Instead of fighting barbarians, they decided to try and kill everybody who agrees with them. Crazy. Just crazy.""
""The Right to Rise thing is historically bad,"" he added.
Stevens, a key figure in Romney's political world, has brutally attacked the GOP front-runner on Twitter. 
""It's becoming obvious that supporting or not supporting (Trump) isn't a political choice. It's a moral choice. The man is evil,"" he said.
Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, brushed off the party's concerns about his candidate. 
""I worry about everything,"" Lewandowski quipped. 
Rubio's calculated, yet harsh attack on Trump came only hours after Romney challenged the billionaire businessman to release his tax returns. Trump responded with a slew of insults aimed at Romney on Friday, remarking that the former Massachusetts governor had no hopes of winning in 2012 because he ""walked like a duck.""
On Monday, Romney tweeted that Trump's inability to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan on CNN's ""State of the Union"" as disqualifying.
As for Bush, he was hardly the only candidate to engage in Trump denial. 
Ted Cruz, who has also raised a vast fortune in contributions, studiously avoided contact with the GOP front-runner for much of 2015, hopeful that Trump would self-destruct and releasing his angry anti-establishment electorate in search of safe harbor. 
The famously tough-talking Chris Christie grumbled to reporters time and again that he would not attack Trump, only doing so before dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor is now arguably Trump's most senior establishment supporter.
Also underestimated was the anger brewing on the margins of the American economic recovery. Working-class voters who are simply too conservative to support a self-declared democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders are flocking to Trump's message that illegal immigration and bad trade deals are decimating the heartland.
Trump has dubbed these boisterous followers, who stuff themselves into arenas and auditoriums, the ""noisy majority."" 
And while they may actually have the energy and enthusiasm to sweep Trump and the Republican Party back into the White House, many in the GOP hierarchy are predicting easy pickings for Democrats and associated super PACs come November.
Another top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, sees the rise of Trump as a logical extension of the tea party movement, which is highly capable of putting conservatives in Congress, but is a turnoff to more moderate, suburban voters in presidential elections. 
""This is the natural consequence of 2009 and 2010,"" said the strategist. ""We co-opted a movement made up largely of the least informed voters. We got significant short-term political gain, but in the process empowered a group that has little interest in reason.""
""We reap what we sow,"" the strategist said.
Trump is equally disdainful of his Republican critics. The celebrity magnate, who authored ""The Art of the Deal,"" routinely lambastes GOP leaders in Congress over the recent budget deal with the White House. Trump insists he will broker better agreements as president by simply walking away from the negotiating table when necessary.
At times, Trump has sought to ease tensions within the Republican Party over his superheated rhetoric on immigration. He often highlights his standing in the polls with Latino voters and praises the Hispanic employees who work at his hotels.
But senior GOP advisers privately worry the damage is done.
""The bubble will crash at some point, but I fear we will be tatters by the time it does,"" one top Republican congressional aide said.",10.0,12.3,42.72,0.0,CNN
102,102,367,Ingraham: Trump's campaign strategy is to take down all opponents Mafioso-style,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/ZnFKx855-JY/ingraham-trumps-campaign-strategy-is-to-take-down-all-opponents-mafioso-style.html,trump,fox,Immigration,8.7,10.0,"Radio host Laura Ingraham told viewers Tuesday on ""Special Report with Bret Baier"" that Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is aiming to permanently take rivals out of the presidential race. 
Ingraham compared the New York businessman’s overarching campaign strategy to that of a Mafia syndicate:  ""Trump's made a calculation that the only way to win [the election] is do what they did in the opening scene of the 'The Godfather,'"" Ingraham explained,  ""You have to take out the other families. You've got to get them in the revolving door, at the altar, at the phone booth.”
Noting a favorite Trump target, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his extended family, she said, ""[Trump has] decided, I guess, the only way to do it is to really settle the score on Bushism: on globalism, trade, immigration, the War [on Terror].  And he's doing it in a way that is really strident and really offends a lot of people.""
Ingraham said Trump’s anti-Bush theme is a risky strategy, as there’s ""a lot of affection, maybe, for the personality, the people, the patriotic side of the Bushes,” an apparent nod to George H.W. Bush’s long tenure in public service and George W. Bush’s handling of the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks.
“Could it pay off?  I think we're going to find out,” Ingraham said.",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,Fox News
85,85,1022,"Clinton allies forming group to protect, register voters",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-02-10-US--DEM%202016-Voting%20Rights/id-e858b2a5987a4e69a7937681bad81331,clinton,ap,Campaign Finance,13.0,12.0,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP)  Allies of Hillary Clinton are forming a new $25 million political organization aimed at expanding voter protection efforts and driving turnout and registration among Latino and black voters essential to her Democratic presidential campaign.
The new group, Every Citizen Counts, is beginning its work as Clinton faces a stronger-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose overwhelming victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary has set off new worries among Democrats that Sanders may soon cut into Clinton's advantage with black and Hispanic voters.
The non-partisan organization will focus on legislation, litigation, voter registration and turnout among black and Latino communities in the general election. It was formed in August and has recently begun developing partnerships with other organizations to expand voter education, registration, protection and turnout.
Clinton has made voter registration and protection a major part of her agenda with minority voters and her campaign and is planning a significant push in the aftermath of her New Hampshire loss to win minority voters in the two remaining February contests in Nevada and South Carolina and a slew of Southern states holding contests in early March.
The group will operate as a nonprofit ""social welfare"" organization, allowing it to take unlimited donations and keep its donors' identities private. Organizers said it would not be involved in the Democratic primaries and would be focused on November's election and beyond.
Clinton said Tuesday night that both she and Sanders wanted to eliminate unaccounted money from politics. But the group's acceptance of private donations will likely draw scorn from Sanders and his allies, who have made the elimination of big, secret money in politics a pillar of his campaign.
During his victory speech in New Hampshire, Sanders said the Clinton team had already thrown everything but the kitchen sink at his  and warned, ""I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well.""
Every Citizen Counts will be advised by Guy Cecil, a former aide to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who currently leads Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC supporting Clinton's bid. Cecil said he will continue in his current role as chief strategist at Priorities USA and other political work.
An early leader in the group will be Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who has endorsed Clinton's campaign and will be a prominent supporter for her in Georgia's ""Super Tuesday"" primary on March 1.
Reed said in a statement that the organization would be a ""powerful ally to those who want to make registration and voting easier and fairer. This is at the heart of what it means to be an American.""
Sanders' allies will likely see the group's role differently. When Priorities USA announced its recent fundraising haul of $50 million through January, Sanders repeatedly told supporters that he had raised ""zero dollars"" for super PACs.
Every Citizen Counts is expected to have a budget of at least $25 million, according to a presentation given to potential donors. Among its goals will be expanding voting access in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin.
The group already has a partnership with the National Democratic Voting Rights Trust, which has been involved in voting rights litigation in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Ohio. The trust is advised by prominent campaign lawyer Marc Elias, who serves as general counsel for Clinton's presidential campaign.
Slides in a presentation provided to The Associated Press estimates that the group's litigation would protect the right to vote for 2 million voters in those four states, which will be among the most contested in the November election.
Cecil, who will serve as the organization's senior adviser, said he is putting together a team and advisory board that will oversee the group. He said the group was not aimed solely on the 2016 election but would be ""in this fight for the long haul.""
""There have been too many efforts to restrict access to the polls, making it even more difficult to vote,"" he said. ""We will engage at all levels: pushing for stronger legislation around early voting, same-day registration and vote by mail, waging legal battles to roll back onerous laws and registering voters in underrepresented communities across the country.""

7,7,1481,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Tells Minnesotans They Can ‘Make History’,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-tells-minnesotans-they-can-make-history/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"MINNEAPOLIS — On the eve of voting in 11 Democratic contests, Bernie Sanders told hundreds of supporters here on Monday that he was counting on them to defeat Hillary Clinton and start a political revolution.

Mr. Sanders, eager to bounce back from back-to-back losses in Nevada and South Carolina, cast the primaries and caucuses on Tuesday as a chance to “make history” and show that the coalition of young and working-class people he hopes to bring together can help him win the Democratic presidential nomination. The senator also criticized Mrs. Clinton on several fronts: her praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, her ties to Wall Street and her stances on trade policies.

“The truth is, tomorrow is important and key,” Mr. Sanders said, adding, as usual, that a high voter turnout would benefit him. “We can win, no question, here in Minnesota — if we have the turnout.”

Mr. Sanders also said it was important that voters understood the differences between him and Mrs. Clinton. He stressed that he did not have a “super PAC” as she does and that Mrs. Clinton supported several trade policies that he believes led to millions of people losing their jobs. He also chastised her admiration for Mr. Kissinger.

“She looked to Henry Kissinger as one of her mentors,” Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd booed. “I will not look to Henry Kissinger for guidance. In fact, Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.”

Mr. Sanders, delivering a stump speech for about 40 minutes, also said that if elected he would change campaign finance laws, devote resources to fighting climate change and work on combating institutional racism. He added that he would push back against laws that in his view suppress voter rights. And he pledged to increase wages and give people access to tuition-free public colleges and universities.

The senator also talked about providing more resources to American Indians. “We owe Native Americans so, so much,” Mr. Sanders said. “We cannot continue current policies which are so devastating to the Native-American community. That will change under a Sanders administration.”

His address came after his campaign announced that the senator had raised $36 million  from 1.2 million individual donors in February. The campaign added that they hoped to raise $40 million by the end of Monday — meaning that they are aiming to bring in $4 million in one day.

Mr. Sanders also planned to hold a rally in Milton, Mass., on Monday night, the same state where Hillary Clinton campaigned on Monday.",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,The New York Times
51,51,1847,Graham: Cruz worse than Obama,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/lindsey-graham-barack-obama-ted-cruz-foreign-policy/index.html,cruz,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,10.3,10.4," (CNN) How much does Lindsey Graham dislike Ted Cruz? Count the ways.
On the question of foreign policy, the Texas senator is ""just as wrong as Obama, if not worse,"" Graham told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
""In Ted Cruz's world, dictators do very well,"" he continued, comparing his colleague's foreign policy to that of Ron Paul, the former congressman, Republican presidential candidate and long-time leading libertarian. 
Asked why his fellow senators are reputed to have such a distaste for Cruz, Graham accused the winner of the Iowa GOP caucuses of being an ""opportunist"" to his core -- one who ""gets ahead at our expense"" and will ""run down other Republicans"" to advance his own ambitions.
Not that Graham -- who has endorsed Jeb Bush -- is warming to Donald Trump, whose foreign policy prescriptions he described as ""gibberish.""
""I don't know if anybody's worse than Trump,"" Graham told Blitzer, rolling out a familiar burn: ""If you're a Republican and your choice is Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in a general election,"" he said, ""it's the difference between poisoned or shot -- you're still dead.""
What about a potential independent run by Michael Bloomberg?
Graham rejected the billionaire former New York City mayor -- who is considering a third-party run for president -- out of hand. 
""I'm gonna support the Republican nominee,"" Graham said, and if it's Trump or Cruz, ""I'm gonna buy a ticket on the Titanic.""
Asked who, of the three highest-finishing GOP candidates in Iowa, he preferred, Graham chose Marco Rubio.
""Marco,"" he said, ""has a worldview consistent with reason and reality versus the other two.""
