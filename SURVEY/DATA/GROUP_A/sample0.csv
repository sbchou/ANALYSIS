Trump before it shuttered amid questions about its ties to the candidate’s top operative returned $1 million to a donor who then sent it to the Trump Foundation, according to a report by Political Money Line. 

The $1 million contribution from Phil Ruffin, an investor, was made on July 16. It was refunded to Mr. Ruffin after the super PAC was closed down. But Mr. Ruffin, who is part of a business deal with Mr. Trump at his Las Vegas hotel property, later gave precisely that amount to the event that Mr. Trump threw to benefit veterans, and to run as counterprogramming to the last Republican presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Trump has repeatedly singled out Mr. Ruffin as one of the donors. 

The group raised $1.7 million and disbursed $1.5 million, according to its filings with the Federal Election Commission. 

That spending included more than $160,000 on polling. 

Mr. Trump repeatedly boasted in 2015 that he did not want super PAC money. But the group, Make America Great Again PAC — using Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan — was run primarily by a Colorado-based vendor, Mike Ciletti, who had worked with Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, when Mr. Lewandowski worked at the group Americans for Prosperity. 

A firm that Mr. Ciletti is connected to was also being used as a vendor by the campaign. In the last campaign filing, that firm received a boost of roughly $500,000 in payments after the super PAC was closed, according to The Washington Post.",6.4,5.2,77.23,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump
8,8,1477,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Promises to Keep Pressing the Campaign,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/bernie-sanders-promises-to-keep-pressing-the-campaign/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.7,10.0,"BOSTON — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed on Monday night that no matter the outcome of the Super Tuesday races, his campaign would continue to rally voters against a political establishment that is largely backing his rival, Hillary Clinton.

Mr. Sanders, standing next to a chartered plane here, said he would “likely” win Vermont’s vote, and also felt good about his chances for winning the most delegates in Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts. He also said he might take a large number of delegates in Texas.

“We started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls — 60 or 70 points behind Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Sanders said to more than a dozen reporters. “We have rallied millions of people who want to see a government that represents all of us and not just the billionaire class.”

Mr. Sanders  added that he was dedicated to taking the fight for the Democratic nomination to the convention this summer. 

“At the end of tomorrow, I think 15 states will have spoken,” Mr. Sanders said. “Last I heard, we have a lot more than 15 states in the United States of America. And I think it is more than appropriate to give all of those states and the people in those states a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice.”

Still, Mr. Sanders emphasized the importance of Tuesday’s votes and cast himself as going up against a Clinton machine powered by local officials in multiple states. Repeating a claim he made before elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders said he was confident he would do well if there is a large voter turnout and that he would struggle if not.

“Tomorrow all over the country, our campaign is taking on the political establishment,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re taking on governors and senators and mayors who know how to get out the vote. They do that very well.”

Mr. Sanders went on to repeat criticisms of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to several industries and to cast himself as a candidate more interested in reforming campaign finance laws and dealing with income inequality. To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay’s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for “The Big Short,” a movie about the failure of the banking industry.

“As Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. 

Mr. Sanders also said that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he didn’t think “real change” comes from someone taking money from such industries and that instead, such change would come from millions of people demanding “a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent.”",10.0,8.7,68.1,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders

Mrs. Clinton will join Representative Judy Chu for the opening of the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary, an outreach group that could help Mrs. Clinton as she looks to broaden the appeal of her campaign. Ms. Chu is chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.

Although there has been much discussion about how Mrs. Clinton will need to attract Latino and African-American voters if she reaches the general election, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are a growing constituency that tends to lean Democratic.

A study from the University of California, Los Angeles, last summer found that the Asian-American electorate is expected to double to 12.2 million people by 2040, making it increasingly influential.

During Mrs. Clinton’s first run for president, she also made a strong push to attract the Asian-American vote. Highlighting her policies on immigration and job training for people with limited English skills, she outperformed Barack Obama, then an Illinois senator, with that group.

Mrs. Clinton will also spend time fund-raising on her West Coast swing, attending an event hosted by Lisa Henson and David Pressler at Jim Henson Co. Studios, the original creator of the Muppets.

21,21,1393,Bernie Sanders' Simon & Garfunkel ad raises goose bumps,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/24/opinions/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-ads-lippert/index.html,sanders,cnn,Immigration,10.3,10.4,"Barbara Lippert  writes about media, advertising and politics in her  ""Mad Blog"" at Mediapost.com.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. 
 (CNN) With the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary closing in, candidates are using every means possible to fire up the base, including relying heavily on the power of last-minute, old-fashioned, local TV advertising. 
That goes for Republican candidate Donald Trump, who, with every outspoken statement along the campaign trail, has earned billions worth of media coverage without spending a cent. He has decided to pour some $2 million a week into TV buys for ads in those two states.  
Obviously, he's not alone. But up until last week, the candidates' TV spots were fairly standard, paint-by-number messages.
The new surprise in this particularly unpredictable political season, however -- the breakout ad by far -- belongs to Democrat Bernie Sanders. Yes, the sometimes grumpy-seeming, non-candy-coated, white-haired, 74-year-old socialist candidate, imitated so well by a peevish Larry David, has released a 60-second ad that is so full of love, enthusiasm and patriotic uplift (complete with flag-waving) that it's downright goose bump-inducing. 
Set to the soothing sounds of the Simon & Garfunkel classic ""America,"" the beautifully executed spot makes no claims, attacks or political statements of any kind. Rather, Sanders assumes the role of the kindly, twinkly paterfamilias, presiding magically over the country, while hugging, holding and smiling at supporters.   
Intercut are shots of an array of solid, everyday Americans who are going about their business, drinking coffee, dancing, walking with their families and baling hay. The cuts are perfectly paced to the music, which, like Sanders, has been speaking this language since the 1960s; it gently suggests an earlier time when people were burning with ideological fervor.
Iowa is a very white state, and Sanders followers are not known for their diversity, but we do see several people of color, all suggesting the beautiful mix that is America. During the musical hooks, ""All come to look for America,"" we see sped-up digitized images of tens of thousands of Bernie's individual supporters (he is famously ""not for sale""). 
The visuals and music build to an emotional rally, with Sanders at the podium. By the very end, he's heard as a voice-over, saying only eight words: ""I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approved this message."" But with this message, he's brought a sweet but nonsyrupy sense of possibility and aspiration about the future (foreshadowing his tag line, ""A Future to Believe In"") as well as a visual and aural feast for those yearning to feel-good again.
 
Certainly, one of the reasons the Sanders ad stands out so much is that it's such a departure from the usual mudslinging.  Attack ads are nasty and dirty, but politicians use them because they work (even to sometimes suppress the vote for a particular opponent).

Republican candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are battling it out in what appears to be a very close race. Not surprisingly, both have gone negative. 
Recently, the Trump camp released a 60-second ad attacking Cruz, his neck-and-neck competitor. It shows the senator from Texas uncharacteristically stammering as he attempts to explain his stand on immigration to Fox News host Bret Baier during an appearance on Fox News last month. 
Using actual TV news footage in political ads has several advantages: it looks good, having been created by professionals for the TV medium, and it costs the campaign next to nothing to produce. And although the clip is shown within the frame of a TV set displayed in the ad, the average viewer, while typically flipping channels, might stumble upon it midspot and mistake it for actual news.
 
The rarely-at-a-loss-for-words Cruz acts like he's caught in a lie about whether he approved of the 2013 Immigration Bill that some say would have given amnesty to undocumented immigrants.
""Sounded like you wanted the bill to pass,"" the Fox interviewer is shown saying from his side of the split screen.  And Cruz sputters over an answer that sounds very much like John Kerry's famously self-indicting line, ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."" The way the ad shows the exchange, Cruz never manages to articulate a coherent answer.
Meanwhile, the spot interrupts with a very Trumpish headline: ""What is He Talking About?"" and later another dismissive, ""Yeah, right, Ted.""
 
Then Trump is shown in footage from a nicely lit interview with ABC News in which he talks about securing the borders ""in a humane way.""
 Immigration is a hot-button issue in Iowa, and the ad persuasively catches Cruz's apparent flip-flop, which could be enough to sow doubt.
 The nature of the attack on Trump in the Cruz ad is not as clear. 
 
While Trump used footage that showed Cruz atypically at a loss for words, the Cruz spot shows Trump in just the sort of gilded, powerful settings that he himself has flaunted on ""The Apprentice.""  

The 30-second spot opens with the hardly engaging phrase ""Eminent Domain,"" which is a real conversation-stopper and would make most viewers blink and reach for the Fritos. It then goes on to explain that Trump forced a little old lady out of her home in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to make way for a limousine parking lot for his casino.
The photos and footage seem dated and picture a younger, more vital version of The Donald. All of this happened at least 25 years ago, and it looks as though Cruz is indicting Trump for being a high roller in the '80s. 
Overall, it comes off as dark, crowded and chaotic, and not compelling. The only memorable image comes at the end. It's a more recent image of Trump in a white ""Make America Great Again"" hat, waving his arm through his limousine window.  
The problem is that's exactly how his followers love to see him -- hardly an evil overlord, rather someone so successful that he's comfortable among the trappings of power. 
The final frame shows the word ""TRUSTED"" in capital letters, with the TRUS in red and TED in black. The red letters stand out enough to leave the ungainly, little-thought-of word ""truss"" (as in ""tie up"") in viewers' minds, forever tied with the name Ted.  
 It's the opposite of uplifting, and I give it no cigars.",10.8,10.7,57.61,0.4,CNN,Bernie Sanders
67,67,1143,First Draft: Hillary Clinton Promises Not to Be ‘Deporter in Chief’,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/12/hillary-clinton-promises-not-to-be-deporter-in-chief/,clinton,nyt,Immigration,8.4,8.4,"Under pressure to consolidate her support among Latinos as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont gains ground on her in Iowa, Hillary Clinton broke with the Obama administration on a key immigration provision on Monday night and promised not to be the “deporter in chief” if elected president.

Speaking at the Iowa Black and Brown Forum, an event focused on minority issues and hosted by the television network Fusion, Mrs. Clinton said deportation raids were “sowing discord and fear” and argued that they were not an appropriate method of enforcing immigration laws. The Obama administration apprehended more than 100 adults and children from Central America and Mexico over the holidays as part of an effort to deport a new wave of immigrants who entered the United States illegally.

As she spoke at the forum, which also separately featured her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Sanders and Martin O’Malley, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign released a four-point plan for assisting Central American families in need.

“It is important to put this in the broader context,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We have to have comprehensive immigration reform.”

Mrs. Clinton declined to promise that she would not deport children, but she said she would ensure that they had sufficient counsel and were given “due process” and a chance to tell their story and avoid deportation.

“What I don’t like are the mass roundups and the raids that just pick people up and send them out in the middle of the night,” she said.

In December, Mrs. Clinton said she was “concerned” about reports of the raids but did not condemn them outright.

The three Democratic presidential candidates have been canvassing Iowa ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses. Mr. Sanders has come within three percentage points of Mrs. Clinton in the most recent poll of Iowa Democrats, and the contest has grown increasingly caustic.

“It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic nomination may not be so inevitable today,” Mr. Sanders said at the event, referring to Mrs. Clinton’s more aggressive approach.

Mr. O’Malley, a former governor of Maryland, did his best to bolster his flagging candidacy and take advantage of some rare national exposure. Asked if he thought Mrs. Clinton would continue President Obama’s deportation policy, he appeared to take offense to the question.

“No, because she is not going to win the election,” Mr. O’Malley said. “I am.”

The Democrats did their best to focus on substantive policy issues and avoid attacks on Republicans. After trying to not to mention his name earlier in the evening, however, Mrs. Clinton could not help taking a dig at Donald J. Trump. 

In response to a question about what she gave Mr. Trump as a gift when attending his 2005 wedding, she said, “Nothing.” Then she elaborated on their previous relationship and offered some fodder that other Republicans might use against the billionaire real estate mogul, who is leading most polls in the Republican race.

“He was basically a Democrat before he was a Republican,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He was somebody that we all knew in New York. He was supportive of Democrats. He was supportive of a lot of the causes that I cared about and the people I know cared about. Now he seems to have taken another road.”",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The New York Times,Hillary Clinton
