23,23,1595,Sanders to release letter from his doctor before Iowa caucuses,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/bernie-sanders-health-records-doctor/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,10.7,10.8,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) Bernie Sanders will release a letter from his doctor before the Iowa caucuses on February 1, his campaign manager said Saturday.
The announcement comes after a Clinton-aligned super PAC suggested it would call on the 74-year-old Vermont senator to verify his health, and one day before the fourth Democratic debate, held in Charleston, South Carolina.
The letter, Jeff Weaver said, would prove Sanders -- the oldest candidate in the presidential field who also would be the oldest president to take office -- is in ""excellent health.""
The Sanders campaign's decision came after David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton super PAC able to coordinate with the campaign, telegraphed his plans to call for the medical records this weekend here.
Politico first reported Brock's plans, and a source with knowledge of his plans confirmed his desire to call for the records in a conversation with CNN on Saturday. Brock, who once was a Clinton antagonist, is now a vocal Clinton defender and surrogate. 
The Clinton campaign, despite being able to work with Brock, publicly rejected his plan to demand Sanders' records.
""Chill out,"" John Podesta, Clinton's campaign manager, tweeted at Brock. ""We're fighting on who would make a better President, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test.""
Brock's plans rankled Clinton's campaign aides, who, while happy to hit Sanders over policy, found the call to be distasteful. 
""What the f***,"" a Clinton staffer mouthed when asked about the story. The staffer was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.
 
Clinton's campaign and Brock's super PAC, Correct the Record, began to coordinate in May in a move that many campaign finance experts said tested the limits of campaign laws. The groups cites a 2006 Federal Election Commission rule that states providing free content online for free -- and not producing ads -- is unable to be regulated.
There's some irony to Brock's call, as the 68-year-old Clinton has also come under scrutiny for her own health and age. 
Brock's plans have already been used as a fundraising tool by the Sanders campaign.
""With just two weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, the super PAC coordinating with Hillary Clinton's campaign is reportedly launching one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable: they are insinuating Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president,"" Weaver wrote in an email to supporters.
He added, ""Let me be very clear with you: Bernie is in excellent health. But this personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and elections."" 
CNN asked for Sanders' medical records in 2015 but the Sanders campaign did not respond.
Clinton released a letter from her doctor in July, who stated that the former secretary of state was ""fit to serve as President.""",10.8,10.7,57.61,0.0,CNN
9,9,1392,Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/,sanders,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.8,7.6,"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.
At the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.
They were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long. It was an enthusiastic show of support for the Vermont senator, and also an obnoxious, ear-drum piercing pounding.
They blared their horns whenever Mr. Sanderss name was mentioned, and many times when it wasnt. The horns even blared throughout a Sanders campaign video introducing the candidate, rendering it impossible from some 2,200 people assembled to hear many of the words.
Veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston unleashed a Twitter  storm of some two dozen tweets complaining about the noise.
If Bernie can’t shush the vuvuzelas, how can he stand up to Putin? he wrote in one. Bernie says he has no SuperPAC. But he has a super-obnoxious horn section, he said in another.
Even Mr. Sanders commented on the cacophony when he finally took the stage. That music is really beautiful, he said sarcastically.",7.6,8.8,57.27,0.0,The Wall Street Journal
65,65,1092,Clinton super PAC gets big donor boost,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/20/politics/clinton-campaign-donations-super-pac/index.html,clinton,cnn,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton's super PAC collected more than $9.5 million in January, more than half of which came from five wealthy donors.
Priorities USA Action earned a $3.5 million check from James Simons, a New York City hedge fund manager and philanthropist on Jan. 11, the group told the Federal Election Commission in a filing on Saturday. 
Jay and Mary Pritzker, two members of a prominent and wealthy Chicago family, also gave a total of $2 million to the group just a few days before Clinton essentially tied Bernie Sanders in Iowa. Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham gave $1 million. Texas trial lawyer and prominent Democratic donor Steve Mostyn added $1 million.
Clinton herself added to that financial advantage over Sanders -- who does not have an authorized super PAC -- with a $14.9 million haul for her campaign. She had nearly $33 million on hand as of Jan. 31. Priorities USA Action had nearly $45 million in cash on hand at the end of January.
Sanders' campaign outraised Clinton's campaign in January though, raising $21.3 million. His campaign now claims more than 4 million individual donors and does not have an official super PAC.

On the Republican side, Ted Cruz had substantially more money on hand at the end of January than the other GOP candidates still in the race. The day before Cruz won Iowa, he had $13.6 million, while candidates like John Kasich only had under $1.5 million.
Some Republican super PACs reported additional seven-digit donations on Saturday: Oracle executive Larry Ellison gave $1 million in January to Marco Rubio's group, and a Texas LLC called Trinity Equity, with some ties to Cruz megadonor and close friend Toby Neugebauer, contributed $1 million to Cruz super PAC, Stand for Truth. 
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had a less-than-stellar fundraising month. Having come up short in Iowa and New Hampshire, his super PAC raised $320,000 in all of January. That's a significant drop from a year ago when the outside group was seen as a fundraising juggernaut. 
Donald Trump, winner of the South Carolina Republican primary on Saturday, reported loaning his campaign $5 million -- which will likely play into his narrative about self-funding his campaign.",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,CNN
38,38,1862,"Increasingly, Iowans Say Their Caucuses Are Ted Cruz’s to Lose",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/us/politics/increasingly-iowans-say-their-caucuses-are-ted-cruzs-to-lose.html,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,6.4,7.6,"ONAWA, Iowa — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas insists he does not want to be seen as the front-runner in the Iowa caucuses. “The only way I know how to run is as an underdog,” he said here after a speech on Tuesday, waving off any Joe Namath-style guarantee of victory.

But try as he might to hold down expectations, Mr. Cruz has plainly become the candidate to beat in the caucuses. Barring new and damaging revelations, many Iowa Republicans now think the only thing standing between him and a victory on Feb. 1 is a groundswell of first-time or infrequent voters turning out for Donald J. Trump, of the sort that materialized for Barack Obama in 2008.

Mr. Cruz has gotten to this point by amassing an energized and growing coalition of Christian activists and anti-establishment Republicans, an extensive organization and a deep reservoir of money. But he is also benefiting from a splintered opposition that lacks either the money or the will to halt his rise.

Some supporters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for example, privately say they believe Mr. Cruz cannot be defeated in Iowa. While those claims may in part be gamesmanship — an attempt to build up Mr. Cruz’s expectations here — more revealing is that neither Mr. Rubio nor the well-financed outside group allied with his campaign has so far spent money on television ads in Iowa assailing Mr. Cruz.

“It does feel like it’s now Cruz’s to lose,” said Matthew N. Strawn, a former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party.

A relatively unimpeded path has left Mr. Cruz the favorite to win the state and emerge as the preferred candidate of the party’s conservative wing. And with a dominant performance here, an unexpectedly strong showing in New Hampshire eight days later and victories in South Carolina and many of the Super Tuesday states on March 1, he could also quickly become something else: the de facto party nominee.

Mr. Cruz, obscured for much of last year by a shifting cast of attention-getting rivals, is relishing the turnabout.

Barnstorming Iowa on a six-day, 28-town campaign tour this week, he is even displaying a touch of swagger. He warns Iowans at every stop to expect tens of millions of dollars in ads attacking him to reach their TV screens and mailboxes any day now.

Joined on his 45-foot bus by a phalanx of aides and a camera crew from Showtime, and with a second motor coach carrying a swelling group of reporters, Mr. Cruz boasted about the fresh denunciations being directed his way. “I guess something has changed,” he said with barely concealed delight.

But what gives his team pause — and what is to many Iowa Republicans the crucial question leading up to Feb. 1 — is whether Mr. Trump will abruptly end his nice-guy routine with Mr. Cruz and begin attacking him in advertisements and behind the microphone at his big, highly publicized rallies.

“I’m a little concerned about that,” Representative Steve King of Iowa, Mr. Cruz’s highest-profile surrogate in the state and travel partner for part of the week, said about the possibility of a Trump offensive. “Trump is so completely unpredictable, we don’t know what he might do campaign-wise. We can’t even begin to think about anticipating that.”

Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Cruz praised for months, has begun to taunt the senator, raising questions about his Canadian birthplace and his faith. But he has stopped short of aggressively attacking Mr. Cruz and has run television commercials about only himself so far.

Mr. Cruz, responding to the birthplace slight on Tuesday, posted a video clip on Twitter from the infamous jump-the-shark episode of “Happy Days,” but has repeatedly declined to say more.

Other rivals have not given Mr. Cruz a free pass: He is coming under attack from the winners of the last two Iowa caucus votes, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. Both their candidacies, which are barely registering in Iowa polls, depend on a strong result in the caucuses. But both men have little money with which to inflict damage on Mr. Cruz — and nothing like the millions that a “super PAC” supporting Mitt Romney unleashed on Newt Gingrich here in the 2012 campaign.

“They’re fighting with rocks against bazookas,” Mr. Strawn said.

Mr. Cruz has become far more entrenched in Iowa than Mr. Gingrich was at the same point in his campaign four years ago. With many conservative activists here feeling a sense of fury toward their party, Mr. Cruz has emerged as the candidate most effectively channeling the boiling anger of Republican hard-liners.

Conversations with dozens of Cruz supporters suggest that the deep dismay Iowa Republicans feel toward Washington is prompting them to coalesce behind Mr. Cruz, whom they see as the only viable conservative contender.

“We need a winner,” Susie Lee, 50, said Monday before Mr. Cruz made a late-night stop at a diner in Missouri Valley. “Huckabee and Santorum are great guys, but they haven’t been in office like Senator Cruz has, fighting.”

Pamela Oviatt of Logan, a Santorum backer four years ago, showed up before 9 p.m. for Mr. Cruz’s 10:30 p.m. appearance. She said there was little talk among activists for any of his rivals. “Cruz is the only one that’s in the political system now that anybody is looking at twice,” she said.

Ms. Oviatt’s distinction about being part of the political system remains a worrisome one for Mr. Cruz’s backers.

Iowa Republican leaders say that he is the preferred candidate among traditional activists. “He’s winning the within-the-system, anti-establishment folks,” said Don Kass, Republican chairman in Plymouth County. But the party leaders also say that Mr. Trump is garnering support from people new to the caucuses.

Indeed, Mr. Trump’s backers here say they are confident that his attacks on the political status quo will bring out thousands of Iowans who have not previously caucused or even registered as Republicans, and his campaign is trying to register supporters as Republicans.

But state party records indicate only modest increases in the numbers of registered Republicans over recent months, a pattern little different from that in previous election years. There are now just over 612,000 registered Iowa Republicans. In early August, there were just over 609,000.

The threat Mr. Trump presents has nevertheless cast a shadow of uncertainty over the caucuses and the party. And that, in its own way, has also aided Mr. Cruz: Mark Lundberg, the Sioux County Republican chairman, said he thought Mr. Cruz was one of the few candidates running who could appeal to the angry Trump legions, should Mr. Trump fall short.

Mindful of this, Mr. Cruz has seldom mentioned Mr. Trump except to praise him. This week, however, he has started invoking Mr. Trump for another reason.

Asked about attacks by some of his rivals, Mr. Cruz observed that Mr. Trump was the target of a similar barrage a few weeks ago. He also told diners at a steakhouse in Carroll to expect “tens of millions of dollars” in ads assailing him to be unleashed in the coming weeks — the sort of onslaught that a true underdog would never receive.

His eyes wandering to a political flier on a nearby table, Mr. Cruz seized on a bit of evidence. “I’m looking at a mailer some of y’all may have seen: ‘Ted Cruz is dangerous!’” he read.

“You know what? To the Washington cartel, to the career politicians there that are getting fat and happy and want the gravy train to keep going, that’s exactly right.”",7.6,6.4,74.19,0.0,The New York Times

Fox News: “The FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email as secretary of state has expanded to look at whether the possible ‘intersection’ of Clinton Foundation work and State Department business may have violated public corruption laws, three intelligence sources not authorized to speak on the record told Fox News. This track is in addition to the focus on classified material found on Clinton’s personal server. ‘The agents are investigating the possible intersection of Clinton Foundation donations, the dispensation of State Department contracts and whether regular processes were followed,’ one source said.”

Wait. What? - WSJ: “In [a recently released] 2011 email exchange about faxing a talking points document, the former secretary of state instructed aide Jake Sullivan to take a secure fax and ‘turn [it] into nonpaper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure’ if technical difficulties with the secure fax system persisted…‘I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture,’ the Democratic presidential candidate said Sunday on CBS. ‘But, oftentimes, there’s a lot of information that isn’t at all classified. So, whatever information can appropriately be transmitted unclassified often was...’ Mrs. Clinton said Sunday that the request to her staffer didn’t amount to an order to violate laws on handling classified material, and said the email was never sent in any case.”

Hillary calls for taxpayer funding of abortions - At a Planned Parenthood endorsement rally for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee called for an end to the 40-year-old ban on taxpayer funds for abortion. The so-called Hyde Amendment, passed in 1976, is the long-standing compromise between pro-life and pro-choice lawmakers that restricts federally funded abortion cases only to those of rape, incest and life of the mother. Over time, this has grown to include government health programs like Medicaid and Obamacare. At the rally, Clinton said she believes Planned Parenthood, America’s largest abortion provider, should be “fully funded” citing that the measure discriminates against low-income women. The group took in over $500 million from taxpayers in 2014 for non-abortion activities.

Sanders strengthens in Iowa, N.H. - WSJ: “ Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are deadlocked in both Iowa and New Hampshire three weeks before voting begins in the 2016 presidential race, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds. The Republican primary contest also remains tight in Iowa. Mrs. Clinton holds a slim, 48%-to-45% lead over the Vermont senator among likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, the survey found. Mr. Sanders edges the former secretary of state among likely primary voters in New Hampshire, 50% to 46%. Both leads are within the polling margins of error.”

KOCH GROUP UNVEILS OBAMACARE RATE TRACKER
Freedom Partners is releasing a 2016 Obamacare Premium Increase Tracker today, ahead of President Obama’s State of the Union speech. The tracker shows the average health care premium increases in each state on the individual marketplace for 2016. Freedom Partners’ policy team calculates that premiums on the individual marketplace increased in 49 out of 50 states. In most states, costs went up by double-digits. Seventeen states will see premium increases of 20 percent of more, the group says.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE…
Saying you liked the music of David Bowie would be like saying you liked Chinese food. There are so many kinds and so many variations within the kinds that there is something for everyone. Glam, rock, Motown-style soul, dancehall, the deep dark depths of Berlin, electronica, pure pop, proto-punk, funk, epic poetry and even the coveted goblin disco king demographic. That means that there is room enough for everyone to have their own favorite song. As music lovers of all kinds mourn Bowie’s passing, his remarkable catalogue is a reminder of perhaps one thing above all others: The real luxury of career success is the chance to take risks. RIP.

GOP POWER INDEX: HAND IT TO KASICH
Unlike another presidential contender, the name of John Kasich’s book would never be “Gifted Hands.” But with a signature karate chop or his patented Frankenstein, the Ohio governor is slashing his way into contention in New Hampshire.

Running as high as second in some new polling, Kasich seems to be really making his stand. Is he probably just Huntsmaning? Yes. Would that be consequential? Yes.

State and national polling shows that the third coming of Chris Christie is not upon us. After weeks of media speculation that the long-dormant chances of the New Jersey governor were going erupt in a riot of electoral possibilities, there’s no evidence of it.

Same goes for Jeb Bush, whose remaining loyalists say is now eying South Carolina as his real last stand. Bless his heart.

The name of the game for Kasich, Christie and Bush is to beat Marco Rubio. Anywhere. Anyhow. He runs best against Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups and, booties or not, seems to be starting to solidify his place.

New Hampshire, with a primary open to Democrats and independents, and an electorate more liberal and secular than the rest of the early voting-states presents the best chance to knock down Rubio.

Aside from an iron-clad consistency that Christie seems to lack and an energy that Bush cannot bring, Kasich is also the kind of Republican that attracts Democrats. Like Trump, he has true crossover appeal.

While Rubio has been sparring with Christie and Bush, he may fight his last round in New Hampshire with Kasich.

Cruz rejects Trump’s ‘deportation force’ - CNN: “Texas Sen. Ted Cruz does not plan to authorize a special force to deport the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, he told CNN’s Jake Tapper, setting up a policy contrast with Donald Trump. … Cruz, who over the past few weeks has specifically endorsed deportations after months of resisting, said in an interview that aired Sunday on ‘State of the Union’ that the U.S. should catch those who came here illegally under normal law enforcement practices, not through round-ups of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S. ‘No, I don’t intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That’s not how we enforce the law for any crime,’ Cruz [said.]”

Trump’s new birther gusto - WaPo: “After days of coyly raising questions about Ted Cruz’s eligibility to be president, given that he was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father, Donald Trump let his audience weigh in at a rally Sunday afternoon. ‘Is he a natural-born citizen?’ the Republican White House hopeful asked several thousand gathered in a Reno ballroom. Members of the crowd shouted back, ‘No!’ ‘I don’t know,’ Trump said. ‘Honestly, we don’t know. Who the hell knows.’ Cruz was Trump’s No. 1 target during the 65-minute event, revealing just how much of a threat the Republican senator from Texas has become to the front-runner. Before the rally started, Bruce Springsteen's ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ blared, a new edition to Trump’s playlist.”

Trump signs Huntsman group’s pledge - AP: “No Labels, formed after the 2010 midterm elections, is asking candidates to embrace four broad goals related to job creation, the federal budget, energy independence and entitlements, promote them in the campaign and promise to work with a bipartisan group in Congress on at least one of them within 30 days of taking office…On Monday, the group’s leaders are announcing the six who stepped up: Democrat Martin O'Malley, and Republicans Ben Carson, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rand Paul and Donald Trump.”

ABC drops debate partner at Trump’s behest - WFXT: “Donald Trump announced Sunday that he had the New Hampshire Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate on Feb. 6. Politico reports that ABC cut their partnership with the paper, the largest newspaper in New Hampshire, a source citing a strained relationship, caused by the front page editorials about Donald Trump. Trump is taking credit for the end of the relationship, saying the paper’s behavior has been ‘highly unethical’ and it has endorsed a candidate who can’t win. On Nov. 28, the paper endorsed Gov. Chris Christie.”

Rubio makes major ad push in Iowa - DMR: “Marco Rubio is poised to dominate Iowa’s television airwaves with about 7,000 ads scheduled to run from Jan. 1 until caucus day — an effort that accounts for more than one-third of all political ads slated to air during that time. The purchases on Rubio's behalf make up more than half of the $9.4 million in total spending for ads that are scheduled to air across the state during the final month of the caucus campaign.”

Despite past quotes, Christie denies Planned Parenthood donations - WSJ: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied Sunday that he has given money to Planned Parenthood, hitting back at a claim by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. ‘I never donated to Planned Parenthood,’ Mr. Christie told CBS on Face the Nation…On Fox Business last week, Mr. Rubio highlighted positions that he said aligned Mr. Christie with President Barack Obama [including Planned Parenthood donations]…A 2012 book on the governor – ‘Chris Christie: The Inside Story of His Rise to Power’ — recalls an incident in the mid-90s where Mr. Christie opposed county funding for Planned Parenthood on financial grounds, even though he said he supported it ideologically. ‘I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution,’ he said, according to the book. When asked about the apparent conflict with the statement from decades ago, a Christie spokeswoman said: ‘The governor didn’t donate to Planned Parenthood.’”

POWER PLAY: IOWA INTRICACIES
As Donald Trump continues to dig into Ted Cruz, the competition for Iowa is kicking into high gear. But a caucus is a lot more involved than going to the polling booth and checking a ballot.
