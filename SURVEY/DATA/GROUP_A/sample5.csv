9,9,1392,Bernie Sanders’s Fans Toot Their Own Horns to Support Vermont Senator,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/07/bernie-sanderss-fans-toot-their-own-horns-to-support-vermont-senator/,sanders,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.8,7.6,"LAS VEGASIf the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders.
At the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.
They were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long. It was an enthusiastic show of support for the Vermont senator, and also an obnoxious, ear-drum piercing pounding.
They blared their horns whenever Mr. Sanderss name was mentioned, and many times when it wasnt. The horns even blared throughout a Sanders campaign video introducing the candidate, rendering it impossible from some 2,200 people assembled to hear many of the words.
Veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston unleashed a Twitter  storm of some two dozen tweets complaining about the noise.
If Bernie can’t shush the vuvuzelas, how can he stand up to Putin? he wrote in one. Bernie says he has no SuperPAC. But he has a super-obnoxious horn section, he said in another.
Even Mr. Sanders commented on the cacophony when he finally took the stage. That music is really beautiful, he said sarcastically.",7.6,8.8,57.27,0.0,The Wall Street Journal,Bernie Sanders
1,1,1582,Sanders Plans Volley of Ads in Iowa in Final Push Toward Caucuses,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/27/sanders-plans-volley-of-ads-in-iowa-in-final-push-toward-caucuses/,sanders,wsj,Campaign Finance,6.4,7.6,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Bernie Sanders plans to air a new flurry of TV ads in Iowa, reigniting an argument with the Hillary Clinton campaign about which of the two is waging the more negative presidential bid.
An adviser to the Vermont senator, Tad Devine, said the campaign will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on additional advertising in Iowa as part of a final push to win the caucuses and make a statement that Mr. Sanders can prevail in a state far from his home base of Vermont.
Iowa is very important in terms of a path, Mr. Devine said. If we can do very well there it would sustain the advantage that we have in New Hampshire.
Mr. Sanders and his team had not yet settled on the precise mix of ads to run in advance of Monday’s caucuses, Mr. Devine said. But the ads could include new spots drawing attention to the speaking fees Mrs. Clinton has received from Wall Street banks, he said.
There are not going to be big, negative attacks, Mr. Devine said Wednesday. Thats not in the offing.
What the campaign is considering are 30-second spots that would reinforce an argument Mr. Sanders has already made on the trail: Cash coming from Wall Street to the politicians is causing them to not be able to make decisions that are for the good of the people, Mr. Devine said.
In a news conference in Des Moines on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders reiterated what is a point of pride for him  he would run a campaign centered on issues and not attack Mrs. Clintons character.
Its not what the American people want to hear, he said.
At times, Mr. Sanders has complained that he has been on the receiving end of personal attacks coming from the Clintons. One Clinton ally, David Brock, who founded a super PAC that coordinates with the Clinton campaign, has argued that Mr. Sanderss socialist views would render him unelectable in the fall.
A spokesman for Mr. Sanders countered that Mrs. Clinton should be ashamed of her association with Mr. Brock, a onetime conservative activist-turned-Clinton partisan.
Now its the Clinton campaign that is complaining of unwarranted attacks.
The campaign released a video Wednesday juxtaposing Mr. Sanderss claims that he would run a positive campaign with press reports saying he’s targeted his opponent.
Though Mr. Sanders hasnt insulted Mrs. Clinton, he has compared her to a reviled figure in Democratic circles: former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. He has also suggested Mrs. Clinton is in Wall Streets pocket because of six-figure speaking fees she has gotten from large banks.",7.2,6.0,75.2,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal,Bernie Sanders
14,14,1356,"As Bernie Sanders Makes History, Jews Wonder What It Means",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/us/politics/bernie-sanders-jewish.html,sanders,nyt,Immigration,9.1,8.0,"But is it good for the Jews?

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Tuesday became the first Jewish candidate in history to win a presidential primary election, setting of a familiar mixture of celebration and anxiety among Jews in the United States and abroad, who pondered what his milestone victory meant for the broader Jewish community.

“Did Bernie Sanders Just Grab Jewish Crown In New Hampshire?” asked a headline in the The Forward, which questioned why Mr. Sanders’ victory received less attention as an emblem of acceptance and accomplishment than the selection of Joseph I. Lieberman as the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee in 2000.

The likely reason: While Mr. Sanders was raised Jewish and even spent time on an Israeli kibbutz in the 1960s, he has been muted in his own embrace of the faith. “Generally the Vermont senator seems uncomfortable with efforts to place a Jewish frame on his candidacy,” The Forward noted.

Israeli and Jewish media outlets swarmed over news of his victory, analyzing it for its significance good and bad. The Israeli paper Haaretz noted that Mr. Sanders often refers to himself as the son of a Polish immigrant, rather than a Jewish immigrant. “The Jewish establishment has a hard time considering him one of its own,” the paper observed.

Another Haaretz commentator, Chemi Shalev, worried that Mr. Sanders’ victory, and his firebrand liberal politics, would stoke anti-Semitism: “More than any other Democratic candidate, Sanders fits the bill of the G.O.P.’s favorite Jewish bogeyman, Saul Alinsky.” Mr. Alinsky, considered the father of community organizing, was frequently invoked by conservatives in the 2008 presidential campaign to tar President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who wrote her college dissertation on him.

And despite the symbolism of Mr. Sanders’s winning the first-in-the-nation primary, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency played down the significance. The news organization noted before the vote that New Hampshire is one of the nation’s smallest and least diverse states. After Mr. Sanders won, it said, “An estimated 10,000 Jews live in New Hampshire.”

At his victory address Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders himself did not even note the historic nature of his win.

But The Forward saw the evening as one for the books. “Tuesday night will go down in history as the first time a Jew won a presidential primary,” the paper wrote.",8.0,9.1,56.25,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders
58,58,2099,Who's funding this pro-Ted Cruz super PAC?,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/06/politics/ted-cruz-super-pac/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.9,10.8,"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) A super PAC spending millions of dollars to bash Ted Cruz's Republican rivals is shielding the names of many of its top donors and strategists, accepting and directing donations through a particularly high number of hard-to-trace companies, new documents reveal. 
Stand for Truth, Inc., an emerging player in the orbit of often clashing constellation of pro-Cruz super PACs, recently pledged to air more than $4 million in television ads to back Cruz in Iowa and South Carolina. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions but are required to disclose their financial backers.
The twist here is that Stand for Truth has accepted more than $1 million in donations from corporations or limited liability companies, whose funders are difficult to uncover, meaning the original source of the campaign cash is hidden. While corporations can make donations to super PACs, an LLC allows individual donors to steer cash through easy-to-register, self-owned organizations. 
""LLCs seem to be a new vehicle for laundering money into elections,"" said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance reformer worried about donors essentially using them as shell companies to transfer cash anonymously. ""It's really hard to find out about LLCs. That's one of the reasons they've become popular.""
Stand for Truth has largely operated quietly, not responding to questions about new television advertisements from media and discarding with the in-the-news public profile maintained by many powerful groups in favor of a sparse website.
No leadership beyond the treasurer who filed its federal elections forms, a former counsel to Mitch McConnell named Eric Lycan, has publicly identified itself. Lycan has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN about the group's activities, and he declined to talk by phone this week. He did say in an email on Friday that the group was run by ""consultants from across the country committed to electing a courageous conservative as our next President.""
The main hand behind the super PAC is Josh Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Governors Association who now heads RedPrint Strategy, Lycan confirmed. Another name behind the group, Lycan said, is a Texas strategist named Keats Norfleet, who did not respond to requests for comment. 
Overall, Stand for Truth raised nearly $2.5 million last year in the brief time it had before the December 31 filing deadline. On Thursday, it purchased an additional $800,000 in negative advertisements attacking Marco Rubio in South Carolina.  
There is no evidence that routing the LLCs was a coordinated attempt to avoid disclosures, but the amount of cash donated is substantial.
Of the 29 individual contributions made to the group between Nov. 20 and Dec. 31, more than half of the gifts were not immediately connectable to an individual donor, the FEC report shows. On December 21, for instance, five seemingly identical donations in equal increments of $50,000 came from five different LLCs -- ""LL Baltimore, LLC""; ""LL Fort Wayne, LLC""; ""LL Peoria, LLC""; """"LL West Allis, LLC' and ""PF Fort Myers LLC.""
Many of the individuals plotting the group's plans remain unknown as well. The individuals receiving payment from Stand for Truth are all being paid through similar entities, with all but one company receiving payment using a limited liability companies or a limited liability partnership to accept the funds. 

It is not uncommon for vendors to receive payments from campaigns through groups like these, and some of those firms are easily identifiable, such Lycan's Kentucky-based law firm, Dinsmore and Shohl.
But LLCs are more difficult to crack. The Texas-based ""Stalwart Advisory LLC"" and Robinson's ""One Harbor LLC"" that the group used as consultants are not visible to the public without sleuthing through Texas public records. Stalwart Advisory does not appear in any state's corporate records, according to OpenCorporates.com, which tracks these filings, nor does One Harbor's ties to Robinson.
Lycan, asked why so much of the group's intake and outflow of cash were conducted through these LLC's declined to directly answer.
""Stand for Truth reports the information for each donor from whom a contribution is received, in accordance with applicable law,"" he wrote in an email.
Donors are increasingly using LLCs like these to give to political groups ever since the Citizens United decision made it easier for non-individuals to cut checks. But the prevalence of these opaque companies on Stand for Truth's report is widespread, campaign finance observers say. 
""The super PAC probably gets more corporate funding than most do by a pretty big margin, but still the bigger donors are individuals,"" said David Keating of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group advocating for looser restrictions on donations. ""This isn't Exxon Mobil corporate funding."" 
Stand for Truth, meant to add to menu of choices for high-dollar donors, has so far focused on negative television advertisements aimed at both Rubio and Donald Trump. A leading force behind the group, Lycan confirmed, is Hal Lambert, a Dallas money-manager who was a co-chair of the official campaign's finance committee until he started the outside group and is a close ally of Willie Langston, the Houston campaign's finance chair. 
And largely funding the group is Adam and Tara Ross, a Dallas couple close to Ted and Heidi Cruz who together gave $1 million of the $2.5 million raised. Adam Ross is influential in Jewish Republican fundraising circles and is said to be close with Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who has remained on the sidelines this year despite being wooed by much of the GOP field. 
The super PACs supporting Cruz that have been blessed by the candidate himself, a network titled Keep the Promise, has not used virtually any of these LLCs. The $40 million raised by Keep the Promise almost entirely comes from three families that each gave more than $10 million to support Cruz through their own independent groups -- with their names attached.",10.8,11.9,49.15,0.0,CNN,Ted Cruz
83,83,1238,Obama hopes to pave way for Clinton with SOTU,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/12/politics/barack-obama-hillary-clinton-2016-election/index.html,clinton,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,13.0,13.2,"Washington (CNN) It's time for President Barack Obama to start letting go.
While aides say the commander in chief will argue in his final State of the Union address Tuesday that America's destiny depends on honoring progress made on his watch, he will be sketching a future in which he will play no major political role.
So his speech -- likely his last opportunity to grab an hour of uninterrupted prime time -- marks an important first step in a delicate and bittersweet yearlong process of handing over his legacy to the protective custody of his hoped-for successor, fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton.
For sure, Obama has no intention of striding off the political stage just yet -- a factor that could complicate his relations with the Democratic front-runner in the coming months. He is making clear that with challenges including global warming, economic inequality and the still-open Guantanamo Bay prison, he will use every last ounce of authority and influence left to get things done.
Obama to focus on future in his final State of the Union speech
""I want us to be able, when we walk out this door, to say, 'We couldn't think of anything else that we didn't try to do ... that we weren't timid or got tired or somehow thinking about the next thing because there is no next thing,' "" he said in a pre-State of the Union video released on Monday.
But for all the promises of an engaged 2016, there's no getting around the fact that in just one year and eight days, Obama must cede the power to protect what he sees as his greatest achievements, including health care reform, staying out of Middle East quagmires and advancing social justice issues such as gay rights and economic prosperity.
There is no doubt that Obama has an awful lot riding on Clinton capturing the White House -- although he has also met with her left-wing rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the White House said Monday.
A Democratic successor is imperative for Obama because Republicans have vowed to dismantle key aspects of the Obama legacy immediately if they win back the presidential mansion after eight years, including Obamacare, a nuclear deal with Iran, executive actions shielding immigrants and policies designed to slow or reverse climate change.

Though the White House says Obama will not endorse a candidate in the 2016 primary race, there is no doubt that he has long seen Clinton as the best hope for preserving his legacy. 
In fact, that belief was one reason many people in the administration's inner circle were wary of a run by Vice President Joe Biden.
""I think Barack Obama believes that it is incredibly important that Hillary Cinton succeeds him,"" said a former close aide to Obama who is still connected with the White House. ""The only way that we have an economy where people aren't losing their health care is if Hillary Clinton becomes president.""
Jeff Shesol, who is familiar with the dynamic between a president and his preferred successor after working in the final years of the Clinton White House as a speechwriter, including on the State of the Union address, highlighted Obama's reliance on Clinton for his place in history.
""The single most important thing that could happen from here on out for the Obama legacy is the election of Hillary Clinton,"" he said.
On one level, the fact that Obama hopes to entrust his legacy to Clinton is richly ironic. After all, a rejection of the kind of politics of ""division and distraction"" that he hinted that the Clintons helped sow was a strong thematic undercurrent of his 2008 election campaign.
But over the years, after working closely with Clinton when she was his secretary of state and as his prickly relationship with Bill Clinton eased during the former president's important embrace of his 2012 re-election campaign, it's been clear that Obama and his West Wing see the rival he slayed in 2008 as the best bet to safeguard his achievements.
Obama, for instance, was effusive in his praise of his outgoing secretary of state when she left office in 2013. He has continued to meet her for occasional private lunches at the White House and members of his orbit who once decried the Clintons now privately and publicly advocate for her.
For instance, David Plouffe, his one-time political guru who outmaneuvered the Clinton campaign in 2008, wrote in an eye-opening op-ed on Medium in October that she would make an ""outstanding and worthy successor.""

The question for Clinton, as she faces a closer-than-expected race with Sanders and a potentially tight general election, is how much Obama helps her as she seeks to mobilize the Obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 but tries to mitigate the impact of his political failings.
The former secretary of state is touting the administration's record on the economy, with the halving of the unemployment rate and progress on gay rights, health care and climate change -- issues that are important to the Democratic base and the Obama hordes of young, affluent, educated white voters and minorities that she needs to turn out.
She is, meanwhile, vowing to go further than Obama on reforming the immigration system and to be more energetic on preventing gun violence. 
But any downturn in the economy during his last year could render the President's record less impressive and harm her own chances.
Obama's struggles to impose U.S. power in the restive Middle East and elsewhere help fuel a Republican narrative that his foreign policy is a bust, to which she is vulnerable as his first-term secretary of state.
Clinton has already signaled she would go further than Obama in Syria, in tackling ISIS, in mending relations with Israel and in adopting a tougher stance toward Iran, Russia and China than Obama has pursued. The Clinton campaign declined to comment on how Obama's foreign policy legacy will impact Clinton. But aides have previously quarreled with the Republican contention that her time as secretary of state will be a liability.
Clinton has also broken with Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which is opposed by many union leaders and grassroots Democrats. She backed the deal as secretary of state but now says does too little to protect the American worker.
Her move on TPP is one indication of why it is so hard for a candidate of the same party to succeed a two-term president -- a feat so rare that it's only been done once, by George H.W. Bush, since World War II.
Clinton has a firm interest in the incumbent President doing well, but she must also create a campaign in her own right that protects her from his baggage. It was a trick, for example, that Vice President Al Gore failed to pull off as he sought to succeed President Bill Clinton in 2000.
That's one reason Clinton has a clear interest in Obama's State of the Union address heralding a strong 2016 for the President.
Sources who know both Clinton and Obama say that the relationship between the President and Clinton remains friendly and cooperative. That will be tested, however, if Clinton is the nominee and as Obama faces pressure to recede into the background before the fall campaign. Awkwardness is bound to flair between the two camps, especially if Clinton finds herself obliged to begin criticizing aspects of his record for her own political reasons.

""I think there is tension inherently because you have a president who is still president who has certain points that he wants to press and certain directions he wants to lead and he wants his successor to go,"" said Shesol. ""He probably has a good deal of confidence in his political judgment and thinks he knows best.""
He continued, ""There have been very few presidents who just wanted to get the hell out of there. President Obama doesn't want to stop being president. If we didn't have a 22nd Amendment, I am sure he would be running again.""
The requirement for an incumbent president to step back -- a process that begins Tuesday night -- is not an easy one, and it requires him to bite his tongue in some situations when his preferred successor deems it necessary to criticize him.
Democrats to colleagues: Bring Muslims to State of the Union
For instance, in an interview with the Des Moines Editorial Board on Monday, the former New York senator said she would improve on Obama's tortured relationship with Congress.
""I have much more experience doing it. At the end of the day, you have to build those relations and consistently be looking for common ground,"" Clinton said.
But in the case of Obama and Clinton, the tension may be eased by the fact that there is now substantial cross-pollination between the two camps.
Two senior aides to the former first lady -- her communications director Jennifer Palmieri and the campaign's chairman John Podesta -- worked in the White House in recent years, and other lower-level staffers also have a foot in both camps.
And if there are strains in execution, they will pale in comparison with the common goals that Obama and Clinton share -- and which the President will lay out in Tuesday's prime-time address.",13.2,13.0,51.52,0.0,CNN,Hillary Clinton
