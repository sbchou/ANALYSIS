61,61,978,"Ad of the Week: From Hillary Clinton, a Single Message Told Across the Decades",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/us/politics/from-hillary-clinton-a-single-message-told-across-the-decades.html,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,6.4,7.6,"The voice is familiar, identifiable within the first few syllables. But the woman on screen, sporting a bright pink blazer and 1979-era Coke-bottle glasses, is not, at least at first. “One of the areas that I’ve been particularly interested in is the area of children,” she says.

By the fourth clip, though, there is no mistaking her: This is Hillary Clinton, as first lady, giving a speech about the importance of children and families.

Previous Clinton advertisements relied on a male narrator to tell Mrs. Clinton’s story. Now she does so herself. Through 11 video clips in 60 seconds, we watch Mrs. Clinton age, her hairstyles evolve, and her diction take on and then lose an Arkansas twang. But despite the passage of 37 years, she seems to be delivering the exact same speech on a single topic: children and families. It is powerful proof of an extensive record. Moreover, it is a sharp rebuke to those who marvel at how Senator Bernie Sanders has been saying the same thing throughout his career or suggest that Mrs. Clinton is more prone to adjusting her politics to fit the moment.

Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have been trading attack ads over the past week. Mr. Sanders released one insinuating that Mrs. Clinton was beholden to Wall Street because of her acceptance of “millions in campaign contributions and speaking fees.” She countered with an ad criticizing ideas that “sound good on paper but will never make it in the real world.” This commercial, “Children,” interrupted the slew of “contrast” ads with a positive message that stood in contrast with anything else on the air.

Created by Jim Margolis, Mandy Grunwald and Dixon/Davis Media, the ad is a new approach to an old message. Mrs. Clinton’s ads have focused on her record, while Mr. Sanders’s have sought to convey optimism and idealism. Yet with its soft, swelling music and the consistent charge in Mrs. Clinton’s changing voice, this commercial carries an emotional, and somewhat nostalgic, force not seen in her ads until now.

Changing channels ...

A new ad from Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign labels Senator Marco Rubio the “Republican Obama” over his support for immigration and carbon tax legislation. The ad ends with a twist, showing a portrait of Mr. Rubio rendered in the same visual style as Shepard Fairey’s “Hope” poster of President Obama.

In an effort to show a groundswell of support, Mr. Sanders released an ad trumpeting endorsements from unions, environmental groups and newspapers. Sandwiched between two of them is an excerpt from a Des Moines Register editorial praising Mr. Sanders. Not mentioned: The editorial was an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton.

Iowans who have recently heard a lot of Donald J. Trump’s exceptionally New Yawk accent have Mr. Cruz to thank. His campaign and two “super PACs” supporting him all used video from the same 1999 “Meet the Press” interview in new ads, each released on the same day.

87,433 The number of times that ads for presidential campaigns and the super PACs supporting them ran on Iowa broadcast television stations from April 15 through Friday.

2,531 How many more times Sanders campaign ads have run in Iowa than the Clinton campaign’s, since Mr. Sanders began advertising in November. (Mrs. Clinton had commercials on the air in Iowa beginning in August.)",7.6,6.4,74.19,0.0,The New York Times
82,82,1060,Clinton: 'I know what it is like to come from behind and win in New Hampshire',http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/politics/hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-bernie-sanders/index.html,clinton,cnn,Abortion,13.0,13.2,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton bluntly acknowledged Friday that is trailing Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, telling an audience at a women's health dinner in Concord that she's been here before and knows what it takes to come back.
""I know what it is like to run from behind in New Hampshire and I know what it is like to come from behind and win in New Hampshire,"" Clinton said, raising her voice at the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws' Pro-Choice Roe v. Wade Dinner. ""So let's go make that happen and win on February 9.""
The comment was the 2016 candidate's starkest assessment of the fact she is looking up at Sanders in the Granite State and a nod to the fact she lost Iowa in 2008 but won the New Hampshire primary a week later.
A series of polls have shown the race in the New Hampshire primary favoring Sanders, the Vermont senator who has made a concerted effort to solidify his base in the state by spending over a month campaigning. A CNN/WMUR poll released Tuesday found Sanders trouncing Clinton in the state, 60% to 33%.
Sanders has responded to his promising polls by arguing that the ""inevitable candidate ain't so inevitable today.""
Clinton's comment came on her one day of campaigning in New Hampshire this week, as much of her time has been spent focused on Iowa.
Although Clinton avoided directly hitting Sanders earlier in the day, she did comment on the fact that Sanders said earlier this week that groups like NARAL, Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign -- all organizations that endorsed Clinton -- were part of the ""establishment"" that he was running against. 
""We need somebody in the Oval Office who really understands that NARAL and Planned Parenthood are not part of the establishment,"" Clinton said without mentioning Sanders, who backed away from his initial comments on Thursday.
Clinton devoted most of her speech to fighting for women's health and abortion rights. 
She said people ""who are so adamantly opposed"" to abortion rights ""have no regard for what women's lives are like.""
""I sometimes wonder whether those who are so adamantly opposed to the fundamental freedom to make your own choices on this most personal of issues are just unaware, ignorant, opportunistic, cynical,"" she said.
As she had before, Clinton also pledged to overturn the Hyde Amendment, a measure that bars the use of federal funds being spent on abortions in most cases. ""As president, I will fight to overturn it,"" she said to the receptive audience.",13.2,13.0,51.52,0.0,CNN
21,21,1393,Bernie Sanders' Simon & Garfunkel ad raises goose bumps,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/24/opinions/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-ads-lippert/index.html,sanders,cnn,Immigration,10.3,10.4,"Barbara Lippert  writes about media, advertising and politics in her  ""Mad Blog"" at Mediapost.com.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. 
 (CNN) With the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary closing in, candidates are using every means possible to fire up the base, including relying heavily on the power of last-minute, old-fashioned, local TV advertising. 
That goes for Republican candidate Donald Trump, who, with every outspoken statement along the campaign trail, has earned billions worth of media coverage without spending a cent. He has decided to pour some $2 million a week into TV buys for ads in those two states.  
Obviously, he's not alone. But up until last week, the candidates' TV spots were fairly standard, paint-by-number messages.
The new surprise in this particularly unpredictable political season, however -- the breakout ad by far -- belongs to Democrat Bernie Sanders. Yes, the sometimes grumpy-seeming, non-candy-coated, white-haired, 74-year-old socialist candidate, imitated so well by a peevish Larry David, has released a 60-second ad that is so full of love, enthusiasm and patriotic uplift (complete with flag-waving) that it's downright goose bump-inducing. 
Set to the soothing sounds of the Simon & Garfunkel classic ""America,"" the beautifully executed spot makes no claims, attacks or political statements of any kind. Rather, Sanders assumes the role of the kindly, twinkly paterfamilias, presiding magically over the country, while hugging, holding and smiling at supporters.   
Intercut are shots of an array of solid, everyday Americans who are going about their business, drinking coffee, dancing, walking with their families and baling hay. The cuts are perfectly paced to the music, which, like Sanders, has been speaking this language since the 1960s; it gently suggests an earlier time when people were burning with ideological fervor.
Iowa is a very white state, and Sanders followers are not known for their diversity, but we do see several people of color, all suggesting the beautiful mix that is America. During the musical hooks, ""All come to look for America,"" we see sped-up digitized images of tens of thousands of Bernie's individual supporters (he is famously ""not for sale""). 
The visuals and music build to an emotional rally, with Sanders at the podium. By the very end, he's heard as a voice-over, saying only eight words: ""I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approved this message."" But with this message, he's brought a sweet but nonsyrupy sense of possibility and aspiration about the future (foreshadowing his tag line, ""A Future to Believe In"") as well as a visual and aural feast for those yearning to feel-good again.
 
Certainly, one of the reasons the Sanders ad stands out so much is that it's such a departure from the usual mudslinging.  Attack ads are nasty and dirty, but politicians use them because they work (even to sometimes suppress the vote for a particular opponent).

Republican candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are battling it out in what appears to be a very close race. Not surprisingly, both have gone negative. 
Recently, the Trump camp released a 60-second ad attacking Cruz, his neck-and-neck competitor. It shows the senator from Texas uncharacteristically stammering as he attempts to explain his stand on immigration to Fox News host Bret Baier during an appearance on Fox News last month. 
Using actual TV news footage in political ads has several advantages: it looks good, having been created by professionals for the TV medium, and it costs the campaign next to nothing to produce. And although the clip is shown within the frame of a TV set displayed in the ad, the average viewer, while typically flipping channels, might stumble upon it midspot and mistake it for actual news.
 
The rarely-at-a-loss-for-words Cruz acts like he's caught in a lie about whether he approved of the 2013 Immigration Bill that some say would have given amnesty to undocumented immigrants.
""Sounded like you wanted the bill to pass,"" the Fox interviewer is shown saying from his side of the split screen.  And Cruz sputters over an answer that sounds very much like John Kerry's famously self-indicting line, ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."" The way the ad shows the exchange, Cruz never manages to articulate a coherent answer.
Meanwhile, the spot interrupts with a very Trumpish headline: ""What is He Talking About?"" and later another dismissive, ""Yeah, right, Ted.""
 
Then Trump is shown in footage from a nicely lit interview with ABC News in which he talks about securing the borders ""in a humane way.""
 Immigration is a hot-button issue in Iowa, and the ad persuasively catches Cruz's apparent flip-flop, which could be enough to sow doubt.
 The nature of the attack on Trump in the Cruz ad is not as clear. 
 
While Trump used footage that showed Cruz atypically at a loss for words, the Cruz spot shows Trump in just the sort of gilded, powerful settings that he himself has flaunted on ""The Apprentice.""  

The 30-second spot opens with the hardly engaging phrase ""Eminent Domain,"" which is a real conversation-stopper and would make most viewers blink and reach for the Fritos. It then goes on to explain that Trump forced a little old lady out of her home in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to make way for a limousine parking lot for his casino.
The photos and footage seem dated and picture a younger, more vital version of The Donald. All of this happened at least 25 years ago, and it looks as though Cruz is indicting Trump for being a high roller in the '80s. 
Overall, it comes off as dark, crowded and chaotic, and not compelling. The only memorable image comes at the end. It's a more recent image of Trump in a white ""Make America Great Again"" hat, waving his arm through his limousine window.  
The problem is that's exactly how his followers love to see him -- hardly an evil overlord, rather someone so successful that he's comfortable among the trappings of power. 
The final frame shows the word ""TRUSTED"" in capital letters, with the TRUS in red and TED in black. The red letters stand out enough to leave the ungainly, little-thought-of word ""truss"" (as in ""tie up"") in viewers' minds, forever tied with the name Ted.  
 It's the opposite of uplifting, and I give it no cigars.",10.8,10.7,57.61,0.4,CNN
4,4,1584,Sanders raised $20 million in January,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/sanders-clinton-trump-cruz-campaign-finance-super-pacs/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,7.9,9.2,"(CNN) Bernie Sanders raised more than $20 million in January, his campaign announced Sunday, as top presidential contenders and super PACs look to tout their fundraising prowess and bank accounts ahead of February's caucus and primary run.
Sanders campaign says its January haul came from more than 777,000 individual contributions. It also plans to report to the Federal Election Commission that it raised $33.6 million in the last three months of 2015.
All campaigns and super PACs must file their 2015 reports with the FEC by the end of Sunday. Some are in good shape and will hype their numbers, especially their cash-on-hand heading into the month, in order to instill donor confidence in their campaign's ability to go the distance. 
Sunday is also the first chance in six months to see what how much big donors are giving to super PACs, the outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash to help candidates. 
Hillary Clinton's top super PAC, Priorities USA, said Friday it has raised $50 million through this month, with another $42 million in pledges. Clinton's campaign also announced it had $38 million on hand as of the end of the year.
And while Sanders, who has sworn off super PACs, a group run by National Nurses United is backing the Vermont senator and has raised $2.3 million, with about half of that remaining, the group reported.

The best funded group of all, as of Sunday early afternoon, is Marco Rubio's super PAC, which raised nearly $16 million in the second half of 2015 and had about $14 million on hand.
Several individuals gave $1 million to the group, including Norman Braman, a Rubio mentor from Florida who has now given a total of $6 million to the super PAC. And two new billionaire donors to Rubio's circle, Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, each gave $2.5 million to the super PAC.

The super PACs supporting Ben Carson and Rand Paul are poor, while the outside groups supporting Chris Christie and Ted Cruz are relatively rich, new campaign finance filings show.
Carson's main super PAC, The 2016 Committee, raised $6.1 million in the second half of 2016, but spent nearly all its money and retained only $560,000 as of December 31. And Rand Paul's authorized group, America's Liberty PAC, has been beset by scandal -- its top two operatives were once indicted -- and now has poor fundraising results: it only collected $1.4 million, with only about $830,000 on hand.
Other groups are in stronger position: Christie's group, America Leads, raised $5.1 million thanks to prominent hedge-funder Steve Cohen, who sank another $2 million to the super PAC. It still had $3.3 million on hand. 
Stand for Truth, a mysterious pro-Cruz super PAC that formed only recently, revealed its donors on Sunday -- nearly half of the money raised by it came from the family of Adam Ross, a close Cruz friend from Texas. It still had $2.1 million in the bank.",9.2,7.9,70.13,0.0,CNN
70,70,1136,First Draft: Digital Ads for Hillary Clinton Focus on Young Women and Equal Pay,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/digital-ads-for-hillary-clinton-focus-on-young-women-and-equal-pay/,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,9.5,9.6,"Two outside groups supportive of Hillary Clinton’s campaign are running their first ads as part of a multimillion dollar advertising effort hoping to energize the millennial female voting base.

Priorities USA, the “super PAC” supporting Hillary Clinton, and Emily’s List, the political action committee that works to elect Democratic women, have partnered on the campaign, which they said will run through the general election. They are expected to spend roughly $20 million on the effort.

The first element of this campaign will be a $500,000 digital ad buy, in partnership with the American Federation of Teachers, which will run in early states with a focus on Texas, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.

“Right now, young women are some of the most dedicated and active progressives this country has ever seen,” Denise Feriozzi, the deputy executive director of Emily’s list, said in a statement. “And we have the candidate to match this moment.”

Titled “Give ‘Em Hill,” the campaign will cite Mrs. Clinton’s record and her fight for equal pay for women. The content revolves around a website and two 15-second pre-roll ads that will run on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and elsewhere online, with a casual style tailored for the millennial audience. 

“When you find out that bro who has your same job gets paid more than you,” a woman says in the ad, “you give ’em Hill,” before a Vote for Hillary on March 1 title card closes the ad.

The effort comes as Mrs. Clinton has struggled to connect with younger voters, who have flocked to Senator Bernie Sanders’s campaign. In New Hampshire, 79 percent of women under 30 voted for Mr. Sanders over Mrs. Clinton, according to exit poll data.",9.6,9.5,60.65,0.0,The New York Times
