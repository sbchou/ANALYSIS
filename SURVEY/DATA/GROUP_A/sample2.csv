4:45 p.m.
Donald Trump's closing pitch to Iowa caucus-goers is a family affair.
The GOP candidate's rarely-heard-from wife Melania has joined her husband at an afternoon rally after a visit to a local church.
She says her husband with be, ""unbelievable. The best deal-maker, the best master negotiator.""
Trump is also joined by his pregnant daughter Ivanka and her developer husband.
Trump says doctors advised Ivanka not to make the trip and joked about her potentially giving birth here.
""Wouldn't it be great if she had the baby in Iowa?"" he asks the crowd.
4:40 p.m.
Bernie Sanders is urging his supporters to help him make history and send a message to those who back establishment politics.
Kicking off his final day of campaigning in Waterloo, Sanders says the nation will be looking at whether Iowa is prepared to move the nation away from establishment politics and economics. He says Monday night could be a ""very historic night for this country. We can make history.""
The self-described ""democratic socialist"" said the country would not make progress unless voters had the ""courage"" to confront challenges head-on.
""If you sweep the problems under the rug they ain't going to get better,"" he said.
Sanders is pushing back against arguments by Clinton and her supporters that she would be the most electable Democrat to take on Republicans in the fall. The Vermont senator says the ""excitement and the energy is with our campaign"" and it will help the party drive a large voter turnout in the fall.

Hundreds of people packed a fairground building in Iowa City to hear Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of celebrity backers the day before the Iowa caucuses.
Cruz says on Sunday that the stakes are too high for Iowa voters to make the wrong choice. He says ""we can't get fooled again.""
Cruz and his wife, Heidi, were joined by Cruz's father, Rafael, and by ""Duck Dynasty"" reality TV star Phil Robertson, conservative commentator Glenn Beck and Iowa Rep. Steve King.
Robertson says the country is mired in ""depravity"" and ""perversion,"" but Cruz can turn it around because he trusts God and James Madison, the architect of the Constitution. Robertson says ""That trumps Trump.""
Cruz supporter Carlene Murphy, of Kalona, Iowa, says she thinks the caucuses will be tight, but that Cruz will prevail. She came to see him in Iowa City.
Murphy says, ""I think we're going to pull through.""

3:44 p.m.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is criticizing a mailer rival Ted Cruz's campaign sent to voters that Iowa's secretary of state says misrepresents the law.
Trump claims at a rally in Council Bluffs that Cruz is under investigation over a ""voting violation"" notice his campaign sent to caucus goers.
Trump says, ""You're not allowed to do it and they're investigating him now.""
""It is so dishonest. It is so dishonest,"" he adds.
In a statement released Saturday, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate says the mailers misrepresent Iowa election law and adds, ""Accusing citizens of Iowa of a 'voting violation' based on Iowa caucus participation, or lack thereof, is false representation of an official act.""
But Pate made no mention of an investigation.
Cruz told reporters in Sioux City on Saturday that the mailing is ""routine.""

Rubio is making an all-out appeal Sunday to about 450 pragmatic Republicans during his last question-and-answer session of the Iowa campaign.
Rubio tells the audience at the University of Northern Iowa, ""It's not just about who you like the most. It's about who gives us the best chance of winning.""
Groups supporting Cruz or Rubio are trading attack ads on the two senators' records on issues, especially on immigration.
And although Rubio has critiqued Cruz for voting to cut military spending, he adds, ""This is not just about making a point, it's about making a difference. This election has to be about the future.""
___
2:50 p.m.
Leaders of a super PAC backing John Kasich are accusing a super PAC backing Marco Rubio of involvement in an attack ad put up by a political group that doesn't reveal its donors.
The American Future Fund recently spent more than $1 million on a New Hampshire commercial calling Kasich ""an Obama Republican."" As a nonprofit, that group does not have to disclose its donors.
American Future Fund and Conservative Solutions PAC, a super PAC backing Rubio, share an ad producer, Outlaw Media, which on its website bills itself as a ""boutique"" firm.
New Day for America cites this and a separate secret-money group that has helped Rubio as clues that the rival candidate's backers are behind the American Future Fund ad. Last year, a nonprofit called Conservative Solutions Project spent $11.6 million on commercials boosting Rubio.
Connie Wehrkamp, a spokeswoman for New Day America, says: ""It's going to be difficult for Rubio's team to keep a straight face denying they are behind the shady dark money attacks.""
A spokesman for Conservative Solutions PAC says his group has nothing to do with the American Future Fund ad - and has not hesitated to contrast with other candidates in ads, meaning it would have little incentive to turn to another group to do so.
The leader of American Future Fund also has said no candidate allies approached him about making the ad.

2:45 p.m.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich says if elected president he'll push Congress to freeze every federal regulation not dealing with health and safety for a full year.
Campaigning at an Elks Lodge in Salem, New Hampshire, Kasich says cutting regulations that kill small businesses would be a priority of his first 100 days. He says after sending Congress a bill to freeze regulations, he'd start a review of ""every regulation in the country.""
Kasich has made reducing the size of government central to his campaign. A clock showing the growing national debt is standard at his town hall events, and he often cites his work to balance the federal budget when he was in Congress during the 1990s.
Kasich is the only candidate in New Hampshire on Sunday as his rivals campaign in Iowa. He does not plan to return to Iowa for Monday's caucuses. He'll host three events in New Hampshire instead.
___
2:40 p.m.
The Democratic National Committee says it's reached an agreement in principal to have the party sanction and manage more debates during the presidential primary schedule, including a debate in New Hampshire next week.
The DNC says it wants to give Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley time to focus on Monday's Iowa caucuses and would finalize details on Tuesday morning.
The statement comes after the Clinton and Sanders' campaigns traded testy statements about plans for Thursday's debate in New Hampshire and three more during the spring.
Clinton trails Sanders in New Hampshire and wants next week's debate to help her connect with undecided voters before the state's primary on Feb. 9.
Sanders hopes to extend his run deep into the spring and adding three more forums might help him accomplish that goal.

2:35 p.m.
Marco Rubio says watch for the boots.
Marco Rubio says the lofty-heeled boots he caught ribbing about early this month may make a return, if he does well on caucus night.
At the start of a campaign event in Cedar Falls, Rubio joked with people in the front row of the University of Northern Iowa auditorium about sneaking a peak at his footwear.
Did he have them on?
""No, I don't,"" he says, adding they're only for ""really, really, really, really special occasions.
So if Rubio does well in Monday night's caucuses, look out for them.
""They may come back. If I look 6-foot-4 on TV, it's because I'm wearing boots.""

2:30 p.m.
Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad will make appearances on behalf of two candidates before the state's caucuses on Monday.
Branstad says he'll introduce New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at an event Sunday night and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at an event Monday. He says they are the people who asked and who fit his schedule.
The popular six-term Republican has not endorsed a candidate, though he drew headlines recently for encouraging Iowans to support candidates other than Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz opposes the federal renewable fuel standard, which requires a minimum amount of petroleum additives such as corn-based ethanol.
Branstad says the Bush and Christie events are just to show ""appreciation for what they've done for me.""

1:30 p.m.
Republican presidential contender Donald Trump is looking to close the deal with Iowa's evangelical Christian voters on the last day before they caucus.
Trump attended services at the First Christian Orchard Campus, a nondenominational church in Council Bluffs.
He, his wife, Melania, and two staffers took communion when it was passed. But Trump, momentarily confused, mistook the silver plates circulated around the auditorium and dug several bills out of his pocket.
""I thought it was for offering,"" he said with a laugh to his staff.
He contributed several minutes later when the offering plates were passed.
As Trump was leaving one of the church pastors put his hand on Trump's shoulder and offered a prayer, ""That Jesus would guide his decisions and that only Christ could guide his decisions,"" the pastor later said.
Trump gladly accepted, bowing his head.
""Thank you, I need that,"" he said.

The chief super PAC helping Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio raised more than $30 million last year, half of it in the last six months.
Conservative Solutions PAC shared its fundraising numbers ahead of a required filing Sunday with federal regulators.
Billionaire New York investor Paul Singer gave $2.5 million, making him one of Rubio's most generous supporters. In October, Singer wrote a letter to his friends encouraging them to back Rubio in the primary contests. Chicago-based investor Ken Griffin also gave $2.5 million shortly after announcing his support for Rubio in December.
Other seven-figure contributors include Florida auto dealer and longtime Rubio booster Norman Braman, financier Cliff Asness of New York and roofing company executive David Humphreys of Missouri.
Conservative Solutions PAC began the year with about $14 million left to spend.

12:44 p.m.
On a day when presidential candidates report their fundraising totals for 2015 to federal regulators, Democratic contender Bernie Sanders is going a step further. His campaign says it raised more than $20 million this month.
That means his pace is picking up. Earlier, his campaign said it raised $33 million over the last three months of 2015, compared to $37 million for Hillary Clinton's campaign in the same time period.
Clinton's campaign did not immediately respond to a question about its January fundraising.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is upbeat entering the final stretch of his Iowa campaign, while trying to stay realistic about the outcome of Monday's contest.
During an interview on CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" Rubio built expectations for rival Sen. Ted Cruz as ""clearly the front-runner,"" while trying to trim his own prospects the day before the caucuses.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll of likely Republican caucus goers published Saturday showed Cruz trailing billionaire Donald Trump and Rubio in solid third.
Rubio is wrapping up a nine-day blitz of Iowa on Sunday with events in Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids and Davenport.
Rubio tells CBS: ""The crowds are growing. The people signing up are growing. Our campaign structure feels good about it...We'll have a strong showing on Monday night.""

Even at church, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz can't escape politics.
The Texas senator attended services Sunday morning at Lutheran Church of Hope outside Des Moines. The sermon by pastor Mike Housholder called on politicians to treat their opponents with love, not attack ads.
Housholder preached that speaking the truth with love is a better way to treat others. He says if you can't do that, don't speak.
Cruz attended the service with his wife, Heidi, and their two daughters. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley was also there but did not sit by Cruz.
Housholder said after the service he wrote the sermon before he found out the Texas senator would attend and did not tailor it to him.
Cruz greeted parishioners, shook hands and took pictures before departing for his first campaign stop of the day in Iowa City.

Even the candidate who says he's the best, the smartest and the highest-energy in the Republican field is leaving nothing to chance a day out from the Iowa caucuses.
Attendees at Donald Trump's event in Dubuque Saturday night awakened to an email from his Iowa political director, Chuck Laudner, personally thanking them for coming.
And urging them to caucus.
""It is extremely important that you get out there and VOTE for Mr. Trump,"" Laudner wrote. Not sure where? Laudner includes a special tool ""to make this process as easy, and fun, as possible""  the ""Republican Iowa Caucus Finder.""

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says the hubbub over whether she had secret emails on her server is ""very much like Benghazi,"" a politically motivated scandal that's likely not as serious as Republicans suggest.
Clinton told ABC's ""This Week"" that ""it's pretty clear"" that Republicans are ""grasping at straws"" in their response to the latest release of emails from Clinton's private home server. The State Department announced it's withholding some of those emails because the information they contain is too highly classified. The former secretary of state says she's been told some of that email correspondence included a public newspaper article. Clinton insists she never sent or received information on her personal email account that was classified at the time. She repeated her call for the emails' release.
As secretary of state, Clinton presided over a key piece of the government's response to the deadly 2012 assaults on a diplomatic compound and CIA quarters in Benghazi, Libya. The attacks killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and quickly became a political rallying cry for Republicans.

Republican presidential contender Donald Trump says ""many"" senators will endorse his candidacy, ""very soon.""
Trump tells on ABC's ""This Week"" that members of the Senate will choose him over their own colleague, Sen. Ted Cruz, who is also Trump's top rival in Iowa. Trump did not offer any senators' names.
Trump says Cruz is ""a nasty guy"" and a ""liar,"" particularly about whether Trump essentially supports President Barack Obama's signature national health care program. Trump says he would replace that law and make other deals that would accomplish his public policy goals.
Cruz says the nation doesn't need a deal-maker, it needs a ""fighter"" for conservative causes.

Bernie Sanders says he's ready to turn the political world upside down in Iowa.
The Democratic presidential candidate says that if his supporters turn out in large numbers for Monday night's caucuses, ""I think you're going to look at one of the biggest political upsets in the modern history of our country.""
The Vermont senator is in a tight race with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Sanders tells CNN's ""State of the Union"" that his campaign has gotten lots of people involved in politics who hadn't been before. He mentions the working class as well as young people who no longer ""want to sit back"" but want to help direct their country's future.

Donald Trump isn't shy about boasting, but the Republican presidential front-runner says he also has a humble side.
Here's what he tells CBS' "" Face the Nation"" in an interview: ""We're all the same. I mean, we're all going to the same place, probably one of two places, you know? But we're all the same.  And I do have, actually, much more humility than a lot of people would think.""
Asked about hiding that side, the billionaire businessman says, ""I'd rather not play my cards. I want to be unpredictable.""

59,59,1766,Cruz to tea party supporters: Don't get 'burned' by fake conservatives,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/ted-cruz-tea-party-rally-donald-trump-marco-rubio/index.html,cruz,cnn,Immigration,12.3,12.4,"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (CNN) Ted Cruz implored a Tea Party audience here on Saturday to examine closely the record of candidates like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, warning a crowd not to get ""burned"" by fake brothers in arms even as he declined to utter his rivals' names.
The Texas senator typically asks audiences to distinguish between ""campaign conservatives"" and ""consistent conservatives,"" but Cruz's remarks Saturday were essentially a dare to those gathered here to look finely at opponents' histories on seven key battles. In a retooled stump speech flush with Trump overtones and delivered right before Trump took the stage himself, Cruz offered a checklist of fights that he had led that his opponents -- like Trump -- hadn't.
 
""How many people here have been burned by politicians?"" Cruz asked the crowd, hours after Cruz bashed Trump's record as more liberal than conservative. ""The stakes in 2016 have never been higher. Our country is hanging in the balance. So I've got a very simple question for the folks here: How do we not get burned again?""
Cruz then listed off seven fights he had led, describing each as a ""time for choosing,"" a reference to Ronald Reagan's iconic 1964 speech: fighting for gun rights, traditional marriage, defunding Planned Parenthood, fighting against Obamacare, a nuclear Iran, ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants and government intervention for Wall Street and other favored industries.
""If someone tells you they're tea party, you can't be tea party and at the same time have supported TARP,"" Cruz said, using an acronym for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a controversial Wall Street bailout program. ""You can't be tea party and at the same time have supported Barack Obama's stimulus. You cant be tea party and at the same time support the ethanol mandate because it's good politics in Iowa and support the sugar subsidies because it's good politics in Florida.""
Trump is one of several candidates who support the Iowa ethanol mandate, and Rubio has advocated for his home state's subsidies. Cruz made sure to knock Republican candidates like Rubio who Cruz sees as insufficiently tough on immigration -- which is also one of Trump's signature issues.
""Anybody who was AWOL from the battle on the Gang of Eight has no standing as a candidate now to say they will enforce the border,"" Cruz said of the comprehensive immigration bill pushed by Rubio in 2013.
Trump, for his part, backed off from his criticisms of Cruz that he had broadcast loudly all day on Saturday. During a 45-minute speech here, Trump left Cruz unscathed until the very end, when he mentioned the loans that Cruz received as a Senate candidate in 2012 but did not properly report to election authorities.
 
And when Trump did finally mention Cruz's name, he appeared rattled after the tea party crowd loudly booed him. 
""You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want,"" he said, the boos beginning. ""He's got bank loans from Goldman Sachs, he's got bank loans from Citibank -- and then he acts like Robin Hood?""
Cruz, who suddenly has started criticizing Trump after seven months of refusing to do so, essentially offered South Carolina voters a roadmap to vet him. 
""When someone announces as a Republican candidate for president, suddenly they agree with the values of everyone in this room,"" Cruz said. ""If they haven't been willing to stand and lead, you can know to an absolute fact they wouldn't do so as president either.""",12.0,11.9,54.56,-0.4,CNN,Ted Cruz
111,111,259,First Draft: Hispanic Celebrities Denounce Donald Trump and G.O.P. Field,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/11/hispanic-celebrities-denounce-donald-trump-and-g-o-p-field/,trump,nyt,Immigration,11.5,9.2,"A group of Hispanic celebrities have signed an open letter denouncing Donald J. Trump and many of the Republican presidential candidates for “capitalizing on negative stereotypes” about Latinos  to galvanize the party’s base. 

The letter, put together by the People for the American Way and signed by celebrities including the actors Benjamin Bratt, America Ferrera and Zoe Saldana and the musician Carlos Santana, is one of the strongest denunciations to date by high-profile Hispanic figures of the current tone of the presidential race. 

“In trying to win the nomination, every one of the leading candidates dug themselves into a deep hole pandering to the anti-immigrant base of the Republican Party that idolizes Donald Trump,” the letter says. 

“There’s no coming back from this. We’ve seen clearly that all the leading Republican candidates have sided with the far-right at the expense of the Latino community,” the letter says. “They’re capitalizing on negative stereotypes and inaccurate information” for political gain.  

The writers seek to prevent other Republicans from hiding their anti-immigration positions. Democrats consider Hispanic voters to be a key part of what they see as an emerging national coalition, as the party’s support from white voters has shrunk. 

“This downward spiral began with Trump,” the letter says, adding, “We must not, though, let Trump’s xenophobia overshadow the extreme policies being pushed by every single one of the G.O.P.’s leading presidential candidates.”

“Trump is certainly an outlier for his racist remarks. But the rest of the Republican presidential candidates went off the deep end with him,” the letter says, also condemning the language of Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.

56,56,2104,Why Cruz is in trouble in Texas,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/25/politics/ted-cruz-super-tuesday-texas/index.html,cruz,cnn,Campaign Finance,11.1,11.2,"Houston (CNN) Of all the states, Texas was the one Ted Cruz was not supposed to have to worry about.
As reviled as he may be back in Washington, Cruz has been adored here at tea party rallies and Republican conventions ever since he first upset the political establishment with a shocking come-from-behind victory in 2012. In his home state, Cruz often comes across as a rock star, a leader so admired by the grassroots that his endorsement in legislative primaries is the closest thing to a gold standard in state politics.
But thanks to Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, Cruz's shot at becoming President may end in Texas.
Cruz, despite his appeal as a native son ideologically in sync with a ruby red Republican base, could very well lose the Texas primary next week, a setback that would strike at the core of Cruz's southern political strategy. 
Both Trump and Rubio are squeezing Cruz in the Lone Star State, cutting into his lead by blanketing the airwaves and working side by side to engineer an upset. Trump continues to hit Cruz with claims the senator is a ""liar,"" and Rubio wants to show he can win establishment and anti-Trump votes, which means taking from Cruz.

Cruz aides remain optimistic that he can still compete elsewhere on Super Tuesday, but they have nevertheless sent stakes for his performance back on his home turf to new heights.
""This is make or break for Cruz. He has to win -- no close second is good enough,"" said Bill Miller, an unaligned, senior Republican lobbyist here. ""Unquestionably he's favored -- and it has been in the bag -- but the bag has a weak bottom.""
Most political observers still give Cruz the slight upper hand and expect him to claim the plurality of the state's 155 delegates, which his team believes can put him close to even in the delegate race after March 1. 
And Cruz certainly is not taking Texas for granted -- working the state's political machinery since the moment he announced and on Wednesday rolling out his highest-ranking endorsement yet anywhere in the country, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.
The question, however, is whether of any of that will be able to stop the freight train of momentum that is Trump, who is planning a huge rally in Fort Worth on Friday morning.
""Most people are just listening to the message, and they're not necessarily going to have loyalty toward Cruz just because he's our current senator,"" said Wayne Richard, a Dallas-area activist supporting Trump. Richard acknowledged Cruz's strong field program, but was skeptical it would make much of a difference and that Texas could have a ""devastating impact"" on Cruz's White House hopes.
Recent polling has shown Cruz with a solid, but not insurmountable lead over Trump. A Monmouth University survey released Thursday gave Cruz a particularly wide margin, putting him 15 points above Trump. And Cruz's vaunted ground game numbers 27,000 volunteers, which observers say gives Cruz even more of an edge. 
Cruz is doing virtually nothing to tamp down expectations. On Tuesday, he called March 1 ""the single most important day in this presidential election.""

But it's not just Trump that poses a threat: Cruz is also confronting an increasingly dangerous Rubio, whose campaign would like nothing more than to kneecap their arch-rival in his home state. 
The Florida senator's super PAC has made its largest investment on Super Tuesday in Cruz's home state, sinking millions of dollars into territory it might not win with the hopes of embarrassing the candidate who really needs it.
Rubio also stands to benefit from the Bush bundler network, which is particularly deep in this town, migrating over into his camp.
""Rubio or bust,"" said Jacob Monty, a former Bush fundraiser here. ""No one from Bush has gone anywhere but Rubio. Rubio is the only hope for rational Republicans who would like to win the general.""
Monty, like other Latino Republican leaders in Houston, have also gravitated to Rubio. He was introduced at a rally in a hotel ballroom Wednesday afternoon by two of the country's most prominent Hispanic Republicans, and his crowd was more solidly Latino than most Cruz crowds.
 
""You're from Texas,"" Rubio told his supporters when someone interrupted him to shout something in Spanish. ""You know what he said.""
Rubio's team recognizes it is unlikely to win as many delegates in Texas. But although some of Texas' 155 delegates are awarded statewide, most are distributed via congressional district: a candidate who earns more than 50% in one of the state's districts wins all three delegates in the district, and anyone who earns below 20% wins zero. So if Rubio's camp can surgically target Cruz and minimize his vote percentage in key districts, they can keep him from building a delegate lead on Super Tuesday.
""You can get nowhere near first place in Texas and still vacuum up a whole lot of delegates just because of the size of the state,"" said Todd Harris, Rubio's chief strategist. ""We're under no illusions that there won't be a resounding Ted Cruz victory, but there are things that we think we can do on the margins to sweep up some delegates -- and we're going to do it.""

Cruz received a hometown hero's welcome at the Lincoln Reagan Dinner on Wednesday evening, where his stickers firmly stuck to guests' blazers.
That dominance wasn't always a sure thing.
A year ago at this same dinner, the question in this city in the pre-Trump era was which of the men who have called it home would emerge victorious: Would it be Jeb Bush, whose father remains revered here by both Democrats and Republicans alike? Rick Perry, the powerful, 14-year governor? Rand Paul, who grew up in a nearby suburb? Or Cruz, who headquartered his campaign not far from his condominium? 
Or maybe an outsider: Scott Walker, who wowed as a keynote speaker here eleven months ago with odes to Reagan and who Abbott said governed ""like a Texan"" in Wisconsin.
The threat to Cruz has indeed been an outsider, but one that no one in this booming oil city saw coming.
So in the final days of the Texas primary, Cruz is looking to remind them of their shared roots. As he collected Abbott's endorsement in a factory on Wednesday afternoon, Cruz's rhetoric was awash with Texas pride and symbolism, calling on his constituents to cast aside their fascination with the New Yorker they love and vote for the Texan they know.
""We are not a people who are impressed by a lot of blustery rhetoric that's not backed up by truth,"" Cruz said. ""We can't be fooled by P.T. Barnum. The time for the clowns and the acrobats and the dancing bears has passed.""",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN,Ted Cruz
17,17,1487,First Draft: F.E.C. Tells Sanders Campaign That Some Donors May Have Given Too Much,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/12/f-e-c-tells-sanders-campaign-that-some-donors-may-have-given-too-much/,sanders,nyt,Campaign Finance,9.1,8.0,"The Federal Election Commission has asked the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to re-examine contributions from more than a hundred donors who appear to have given more than the legally permissible amount.

The vast majority of the donors gave several small contributions to Mr. Sanders for the Democratic primary that eventually totaled more than the $2,700 limit, according to a letter the election commission sent to Mr. Sanders on Thursday. 

Such glitches are common in political campaigns, which are required to track small donors and begin itemizing their contributions when their total reaches $200. That can be harder when donors use slightly different variations of their names or contribute from more than one address. Mr. Sanders’s campaign may choose to refund the excess contributions or re-designate the excess for use in a general election campaign, when candidates can accept another $2,700.

But the F.E.C.’s review suggests that the sheer volume of small contributions Mr. Sanders is receiving — more than 3 million of them so far, according to his campaign — may be straining his campaign’s ability to keep track of which donors are which. Most of the contributions cited by the commission were given by donors with relatively unusual names, whose small checks are generally easier to tally.

In early February, after the end of the fourth fund-raising quarter, Mr. Sanders’s campaign announced that it had more than 1.3 million donors, an astonishing number for so early in the campaign cycle. And last week, the campaign announced it had received 3.25 million total donations, the most of any presidential candidate in the race. The campaign’s most recent F.E.C. filing was nearly 100,000 pages long.

In an e-mail, Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said, “We are looking into the F.E.C. staff questions and are committed to full and accurate disclosure of the tremendous grass-roots support for Sen. Sanders from people all across America.”",8.0,9.1,56.25,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders
