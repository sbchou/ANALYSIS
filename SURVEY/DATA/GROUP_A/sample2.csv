119,119,209,Evaluations: Why I Can’t Learn to Love Donald Trump,http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/why-i-wont-learn-to-love-donald-trump/,trump,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,16.2,15.2,"I concluded this week’s Campaign Stops column, written amid near-total Republican disarray, by wondering if reform-minded and populist-friendly conservatives should stop rooting against Donald Trump and hoping for a successful co-optation of the legitimate portions of his message, and instead just accept that the Trump phenomenon is going to carry all before it in this cycle — welcoming it as one part creative destruction, one part judgment issued from on high.

Now let me explain why I still think the answer is no, why I can’t just win the victory over myself and learn to love Big Donald. Here I’ll draw on an argument between two liberals, ruminating on how the possibility of a Trump nomination should be regarded on the left. On the one hand, Jonathan Chait has made the case that his fellow liberals should cheer Trump on, not only because he’s unlikely to win a general election but also because it wouldn’t be so bad if he did, since he’d be a much more ideologically-unsettled figure than a President Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, and thus more likely to cut deals with Democrats and generally govern from some kind of center. As a hopeful example, he invokes as a Trumpian forerunner Arnold Schwarzenegger, another misogynist celebrity demagogue who ended up as “a highly effective governor” because all he cared about was his popularity, which made him much more willing to work across party lines.

Then for a counterpoint, there’s Ezra Klein, who concedes that we can’t know what a Trump White House would mean for public policy, but argues that liberals (and everyone else) should find him “terrifying” nonetheless, for reasons that have less to do with the specifics of what he might stand for than with how unbound he is from normal conventions and restraints:

Trump’s other gift … is his complete lack of shame. It’s easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they’re exposed as liars, when they’re seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.

Trump doesn’t. He has the reality television star’s ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won’t, to say what others can’t, to do what others wouldn’t.

Trump lives by the reality television trope that he’s not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they’re not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. “I’m not here to make friends” is another way of saying, “I’m not bound by the social conventions of normal people.” The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.

This, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field … But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do — or what he wouldn’t do.

This seems, unfortunately, mostly right. I’m not “terrified” of Trump because fool that I am, I still don’t think he’ll be the Republican nominee. But I don’t think anyone, right or left, should feel sanguine about what he represents, or about the prospect of having someone so unrestrained elected to an office that’s increasingly lacking in effective formal restraints upon its powers.

The Schwarzenegger example does show that a major American state’s government can survive a Trump-like figure at the helm. But first of all the idea that Arnie was “highly effective” because he did some things that liberals like is a little strange, since he spent his second term presiding ineffectually over a period of constant, gridlocked budget crises and left office with approval ratings in the 20s. (At best you could argue that he was a merciful failure as a strongman.) And second, when it comes to celebrity-infused demagoguery Schwarzenegger was Trump-like but also Trump-lite: For all his coarseness he did tone things down, not up, during his campaign and subsequent administration, trying to play at least somewhat by normal political rules. Yes, there was talk of “girlie men” and racially-charged remarks, and he delighted in striking action-hero poses. But there was nothing quite like Trump’s constant doubling down on norm-breaching and taboo-busting, no Schwarzeneggerian equivalent of the promises to ban Muslims and torture the relatives of terrorists …

… and even if there had been, the governorship of California is just not that powerful an office, whereas the presidency of the United States has been growing more powerful and less constrained by traditional norms with every passing administration. One need not pass judgment on individual presidents and their policies to recognize this trend, and to expect it to continue regardless of which party wins in 2016. In that context, a successful man-on-horseback candidacy, in which a president is elected on whose selling point is that he refuses to bow to convention or restraint, is precisely the kind of thing that could expose some of the underlying perils inherent in our system, and accelerate America’s march toward either Caesarism or crisis.

The best case scenario — for the republic, if not for public policy — might be that such a president would simply be a failure, an instant John Tyler-esque lame duck with both parties maneuvering to replace him from day one; the worst case is some sort of constitutional crisis, except with a president far less likely than Richard Nixon to bow to the Beltway consensus and give way.

Now probably a Trump presidency would fall somewhere in between those two possibilities; probably he really would be a little less over-the-top in office than he has been on the trail. (In order to win a general election, clearly, he would need to adapt and become, well, a little more politically correct.) But a Trumpian four years would almost certainly involve a significant degradation of the unwritten restraints on presidential conduct, an acceleration of royalist tendencies that may be built into our system but still deserve to be slowed down, and a blurring of reality-TV and political culture that takes us several leagues further along the road to President Camacho. I don’t think that the nebulous possibility of dealmaking should tempt liberals to welcome this kind of experiment; I don’t think the hope of a more working-class-friendly G.O.P. should tempt conservative reformers to learn to love it either. And the fact that recent presidents have already pushed the envelope in all kinds of troubling ways is not a “what’s the big deal” case for accepting Trumpism: Noting that George W. Bush approved waterboarding (while insisting that we don’t torture) or that Barack Obama launched wars without congressional approval (while denying they were real wars) is not a case for electing a candidate who’s gleeful in his promises to torture with abandon and rob other countries of their oil; rather, it’s a warning of what the office does to men who are restrained by norms and rules and the tribute that executive vice still has to pay to constitutional virtue.

The only case for actively embracing a figure like Trump, it seems to me, is if he were the only candidate willing to address a crisis or challenge that’s so existentially or absolutely important that it’s worth gambling our ragged republican norms to see it successfully resolved. This is the vibe I get from certain immigration restrictionists, from the Ann Coulter-Mickey Kaus cohort to, well, more insalubrious voices on the web. And frankly if America were in Germany’s position right now, and voting Trump was the only alternative to admitting 500,000-1,000,000 Middle Eastern migrants every year in perpetuity and/or tearing the country’s politics apart, I might find the case for the Donald a little more persuasive. But one can oppose Rubio-Schumer and other “comprehensive” immigration reforms (and I’ve written a lot of words in opposition) and still recognize 1) that the problems with America’s immigration policy do not pose an existential threat to the republic  and 2) that Trump is about as likely to be a reliable immigration hawk in office as he is to be a reliable anything, which is to say not very. (He’ll boost deportations and build a wall in the first year, sure — but as he’s already promised, it’ll have the biggest, most luxurious door you’ve ever seen.)

Which is why it’s one thing for people dissatisfied with Conservatism, Inc. and the G.O.P. to be anti-anti-Trump — as I’ve been in the past, and will be again if he fades — and urge the party to take his challenge seriously and co-opt some of his gestures and ideas. But it’s quite another to be actively pro-Trump: Welcoming a would-be strongman because he’s pandering to you on a single issue rarely turns out well, and a vote for the rhinoceros is usually just a good way to end up gored.",15.2,16.2,37.98,0.0,The New York Times

Trump before it shuttered amid questions about its ties to the candidate’s top operative returned $1 million to a donor who then sent it to the Trump Foundation, according to a report by Political Money Line. 

The $1 million contribution from Phil Ruffin, an investor, was made on July 16. It was refunded to Mr. Ruffin after the super PAC was closed down. But Mr. Ruffin, who is part of a business deal with Mr. Trump at his Las Vegas hotel property, later gave precisely that amount to the event that Mr. Trump threw to benefit veterans, and to run as counterprogramming to the last Republican presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Trump has repeatedly singled out Mr. Ruffin as one of the donors. 

The group raised $1.7 million and disbursed $1.5 million, according to its filings with the Federal Election Commission. 

That spending included more than $160,000 on polling. 

Mr. Trump repeatedly boasted in 2015 that he did not want super PAC money. But the group, Make America Great Again PAC — using Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan — was run primarily by a Colorado-based vendor, Mike Ciletti, who had worked with Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, when Mr. Lewandowski worked at the group Americans for Prosperity. 

A firm that Mr. Ciletti is connected to was also being used as a vendor by the campaign. In the last campaign filing, that firm received a boost of roughly $500,000 in payments after the super PAC was closed, according to The Washington Post.",6.4,5.2,77.23,0.0,The New York Times
89,89,1097,Clinton to Planned Parenthood: 'I will always have your back',http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/10/politics/clinton-planned-parenthood/index.html,clinton,cnn,Abortion,13.8,12.8,"Hooksett, New Hampshire (CNN) Hillary Clinton on Sunday cast herself as Planned Parenthood's most electable champion, pledging at an endorsement event that, as president, she would always stand with the women's health organization. 
Before a fired-up crowd of primarily pink-clad women, Clinton alluded to the controversies the group has faced since a series of videos by anti-abortion activists were released in 2015. Clinton argued that Republicans would ""accelerate the assault on access to safe and legal abortion"" and that she is the person best positioned to beat them in November. 
""I will always defend Planned Parenthood and I will say consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported and protected, not undermined, misrepresented and demonized,"" Clinton said. ""As your president, I will always have your back.""
Clinton has grown fond of the electability argument in recent weeks because it allows her to both directly hit Republicans -- as she did on Sunday -- and subtly knock Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her chief rival for the Democratic nomination. 
""We need a Democratic nominee who will be able to beat the Republicans and get the job done for Americans,"" Clinton said before asking the audience that ""the next president would easily appoint more than one justice to the Supreme Court.""

""That fight is not over either. Access to affordable birth control is still hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court,"" Clinton said. ""If a Republicans wins this election and gets the chance to stack the Supreme Court with right wing justices, together they will accelerate the move to take America in the wrong direction on so many issues that you and I have fought for and many Americans take for granted."" 
Clinton was introduced by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who said Clinton was the ""leader I trust in the White House to make sure women and families move forward.""
""In this election, with the attacks on women's health and rights, more than ever before we don't need a friend, a solid vote, a statement, we need a fighter,"" Richards said about the former secretary of state.
In interview before the event, Richards said that while Sanders has long been a ""very solid vote"" for their organization, she ""could never remember a time where there is a stronger candidate for president [than Hillary Clinton] on the issues that are fundamental to Planned Parenthood.""
Sunday's endorsement was the first time the group is endorsing in a presidential primary.
Planned Parenthood plans to spend at least $20 million in this election cycle and Richards said that will include many ""grassroots efforts"" for Clinton.",12.8,13.8,44.07,0.0,CNN
92,92,219,First Draft: 2 Ex-Presidents of Mexico Say No Way Country Is Paying for Donald Trump’s Wall,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/25/2-ex-presidents-of-mexico-say-no-way-theyre-paying-for-donald-trumps-wall/,trump,nyt,Immigration,4.8,6.0,"At almost all of his campaign rallies, Donald J. Trump leads a familiar refrain as he details his plan to build a giant wall along the border with Mexico.

“Who’s gonna pay?” he asks.

Without fail, Mr. Trump’s adoring fans reply, “Mexico!”

While the Mexican government has said little about Mr. Trump’s plan to beef up border security, two of the country’s former presidents have a message for Mr. Trump: Mexico won’t pay.

“I’m not going to pay,” Vicente Fox said, using a profanity to comment about the wall Thursday in an interview with Fusion. “He should pay for it. He’s got the money.”

Mr. Fox, who was president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, was clear in his opposition to Mr. Trump, calling him “egocentric” and lacking in any political values. Mr. Fox also expressed disbelief that Mr.Trump did well with Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday and called on them to open their eyes.

“I’d like to know who those Hispanics are,” Mr. Fox said. “They are followers of a false prophet.”

Mr. Fox’s successor, Felipe Calderón, expressed similar concerns about the wall this month.

“Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall!” Mr. Calderón told CNBC. “And it’s going to be completely useless.”

Mr. Calderón, who was president from 2006 until 2012, went on to argue that Mr. Trump was misinformed about the flow of immigrants from Mexico to the United States and that closing the border would harm America’s economy.

For his part, Mr. Trump has insisted that as president he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, which he estimates would cost about $8 billion.

On Thursday, however, he appeared to be more angered by Mr. Fox’s tone. Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for lacing his campaign speeches with profanity, called on Mr. Fox to apologize for using foul language when talking about the wall.

“FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!”— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2016",6.0,4.8,78.25,0.0,The New York Times
84,84,1151,First Draft: ‘Super PAC’ Backing Hillary Clinton Says It Will Raise More Than It Did in ’12,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/29/super-pac-backing-hillary-clinton-says-it-is-raising-more-than-it-did-for-obama/,clinton,nyt,Campaign Finance,13.0,12.0,"A “super PAC” backing Hillary Clinton raised more than $25 million during the last six months of 2015, officials with the group said on Friday, with $10 million more arriving in January.

The rising pace of fund-raising puts the group, Priorities USA Action, in a stronger early position than any Democratic super PAC before it, in an election cycle where Republican outside groups are expected to spend heavily to help the party’s eventual nominee reclaim the White House. All told, the group has raised almost $51 million in the 2016 election cycle.

In addition to the money raised, donors have committed to providing at least $42 million in additional contributions, officials said. Those pledges would allow the group to exceed its total fund-raising for the 2012 cycle, when Priorities was formed to help President Obama win re-election. As of Friday, the group had almost $45 million in cash on hand.

“We have raised significantly more resources than at this point in 2012, built a team of our Party’s strongest leaders and activists, and are developing cutting-edge strategies to reach Democratic and undecided voters in every battleground state,” Guy Cecil, the group’s co-chairman, said in a memorandum obtained by The New York Times.

While full details of Priorities’ fund-raising will not be available until the super PAC files its official fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission this weekend, Mr. Cecil’s memorandum said the group had raised money from several labor unions that are backing Mrs. Clinton, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Laborers’ International Union of North America.

A person with knowledge of the group’s fund-raising said the organization had also secured large donations or commitments from a number of wealthy individuals, including James Simons, a New York hedge fund founder, and Danny Abraham, a Florida entrepreneur.

While Mrs. Clinton remains locked in the polls with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire, Priorities has so far banked most of its money for an expected general election campaign. The group’s spending for the 2016 cycle includes just $444,961 on independent expenditures as of Friday, most of it defending Mrs. Clinton from Republican attacks or promoting Mrs. Clinton’s positions.",12.0,13.0,46.1,0.0,The New York Times
