90,90,278,"First Draft: Rudy Giuliani, Although Friends With Donald Trump, Is Not Ready to Endorse Yet",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/22/rudy-giuliani-although-friends-with-donald-trump-is-not-ready-to-endorse-yet/,trump,nyt,Immigration,4.0,6.4,"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York,  is an admirer of Donald J. Trump and has been friends with him for decades. His endorsement could be useful to Mr. Trump, both as an affirmation in national security terms and an appeal to transplanted New Yorkers in Florida and elsewhere. 

But while Mr. Giuliani speaks with Mr. Trump regularly, and has done so for months, he does not consider himself an adviser and is not yet ready to endorse any of the candidates. 

“I wouldn’t call it advising him,” Mr. Giuliani said in a telephone interview on Monday after a published report suggested he has recently emerged as a key adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani added, “I’m not sure who I’m going to endorse,” though he said he was open to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, but “not Cruz,” he said, referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump’s chief rival so far.

Mr. Giuliani was mayor for eight years and before that the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where Mr. Trump has been a major figure since the late 1980s. 

“I talk to him on a pretty regular basis,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I don’t consider myself an adviser. I’ve talked to Donald for 25 years. So I talk to him a lot anyway.” 

Mr. Giuliani said he frequently spoke with Jeb Bush when he was a candidate, about as frequently as he did to Mr. Trump, and that he spoke more frequently with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with whom he is also friends. 

As for Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani said he would call and offer his thoughts and advice on a range of topics. “Sometimes he takes it, sometimes he doesn’t,” Mr. Giuliani said. He told Mr. Trump that he thought his statement during his campaign kickoff speech that Mexican immigrants were rapists and were bringing crime into the country “was backwards,” although he thought he had “a pretty good point about illegal immigration.” 

He said he also still considered former President George W. Bush “one of my heroes,” and disagreed with Mr. Trump’s assertions that the Bush administration has mishandled the invasion of Iraq in 2003. 

But Mr. Giuliani, who was heralded for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and ran for president himself in 2008, said Mr. Trump had made a valuable case about China’s currency manipulation. He  said he also valued what Mr. Trump had said about the terrorism threats of the Islamic State.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio are “more flexible people” than Mr.  Cruz, Mr. Giuliani said. “They’re not rigid ideologues.” 

He added of Mr. Trump, “You don’t succeed in business by being a rigid ideologue.”",6.4,4.0,85.69,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump
40,40,1998,Ted Cruz Starts to Crack G.O.P. Establishment’s Wall of Opposition,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/us/politics/ted-cruz-starts-to-crack-gop-establishments-wall-of-opposition.html,cruz,nyt,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"NEW ORLEANS — Striding up the sidewalk of one of this city’s most affluent neighborhoods on Monday evening, S. Scott Sewell seemed an unlikely figure to be attending a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz. An oil industry executive, Mr. Sewell served in President George Bush’s administration, lent a hand to George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential recount, and was twice a chairman for Mitt Romney’s Louisiana campaigns.

But if such a creature of the Republican establishment appeared an odd fit to support a candidate whose political identity was shaped challenging his party’s leadership, the candlelit, art-filled setting for Mr. Cruz’s reception was even more surprising: the elegant home of the longtime Bush loyalist Mary Matalin and her husband, James Carville, the Democratic strategist.

The vast majority of Republican elites remain bitterly opposed to the prospect of Mr. Cruz’s becoming the party’s presidential nominee, some even preferring to take their chances with Donald J. Trump. Yet, to the strains of a jazz trio a block from St. Charles Avenue here, over Texas barbecue at his Houston campaign office and in one of Washington’s see-and-be-seen steakhouses, Mr. Cruz, Washington’s chief anti-establishment agitator, has quietly begun wooing some of the party’s most entrenched donors and officials.

“We’re working hard to consolidate a lot of support,” Mr. Cruz told a reporter as he mingled with guests arriving at Ms. Matalin’s home.

Some in the old guard have started signaling to their reluctant right-of-center brethren that it is time to face the possibility that the hard-line Mr. Cruz could be their standard-bearer.

“If Cruz makes it, which is very doable, every one of the establishment crowd who is now eviscerating him will line up, salute smartly and get on board,” Ms. Matalin said, offering a mix of prodding and prophecy. “No one will want to be responsible for a G.O.P. defeat.”

That even traces of détente have appeared between Mr. Cruz and the party’s traditional power brokers this early illustrates how thoroughly unpredictable the Republican race has been — and that, for major political donors, it can be safer to hedge one’s bets in such a volatile environment.

But others in the party hierarchy, including the officially neutral Ms. Matalin, either share some of the frustrations that have propelled Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump or at least recognize what the two have tapped into.

They also take him at his word. “I believe in Senator Cruz because he believes what he’s saying,” Mr. Sewell said outside the Matalin-Carville home, echoing sentiments often heard among the rank-and-file at Mr. Cruz’s Iowa gatherings.

What is more striking, and will cause deep consternation among Republican strategists, is that other donors are beginning to embrace Mr. Cruz’s argument that he can win a general election by motivating core conservatives to come to the polls rather than by appealing to swing voters.

Andrew Puzder, chief executive of the conglomerate that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., supported both of Mr. Romney’s campaigns and has contributed to a number of “super PACs” and candidates this year, including Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But after spending a couple of hours eating brisket with Mr. Cruz on Sunday at his campaign headquarters, Mr. Puzder said he was “very seriously considering” getting behind him, in part because of his appeal to the conservative base.

“I’ve become a one-issue voter,” Mr. Puzder said. “My one issue is whether somebody is going to win. My big question is: What is your path to a general election victory?”

Unhappily recalling that Mr. Romney won among self-described independents but still was soundly defeated by President Obama, Mr. Puzder said, “Part of the reason was that the base didn’t turn out to vote, and Senator Cruz understands that needs to happen.”

The theory of the missing conservative voter, central to Mr. Cruz’s pitch, has been widely and robustly challenged, including by figures on the right. But it is taking flight among some in the party’s donor class.

“The reason Republicans lost in 2012 and 2008 is not because we lost swing voters,” Carla Sands, a California investor, wrote in an invitation to a $1,000-a-plate Los Angeles luncheon this week featuring Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi. “The reason Republicans lost is because they failed to motivate and turn out their base — mainly evangelical voters in states like Florida, Colorado and Pennsylvania who didn’t feel that the Republican nominee spoke to their issues.”

Ms. Sands, a philanthropist who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to establishment-aligned Republicans, predicted that “this election will also be a ‘base’ election, and we need a candidate who inspires and excites the base of our party to come out and vote.”

Mr. Cruz’s wife, who met him on the 2000 Bush campaign and worked in the administration, has emerged as something of a liaison to right-of-center donors. She headlined events in Atlanta; Austin, Dallas, Houston and Midland, Tex.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Seattle in November and December, helping Mr. Cruz raise nearly $20 million in the final quarter of the year — a haul expected to exceed those of any of the more establishment-friendly candidates.

But Mr. Cruz has other links to the party elites he has long railed against: Mr. Puzder was connected to him by Anthony R. Dolan, Ronald Reagan’s chief speechwriter, who is now part of Mr. Cruz’s team of advisers. Chad Sweet, Mr. Cruz’s campaign chairman, worked at Goldman Sachs and was chief of staff to Michael Chertoff, a Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush.

Mr. Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, has also cultivated relationships with the relatively small universe of Republican strategists. In December, he telephoned the lobbyist Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns, about arranging a get-acquainted meeting with him for Mr. Cruz when Congress returns this month (the meeting has not come about).

Mr. Cruz will, though, appear at a pair of fund-raisers in the Washington area next week that may lure some party regulars: a $1,000 per-person “happy hour” at the Capital Grille, followed by an event at the McLean, Va., home of Michael Adams, a former Bechtel Group executive.

Not all of Mr. Cruz’s wooing has led to a love connection. Former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, who describes himself as “a RINO” — a Republican in name only — rode from the airport to a fund-raiser with Mr. Cruz when the Texas senator visited California last month.

“He’s doing extremely well, which surprises me because I don’t think he’s as warm a personality as others,” Mr. Riordan said. “But he’s a very strong person.”

The response was more favorable in New Orleans, where Mr. Cruz drew younger Republicans and local figures like William Goldring, a distillery executive, the restaurateur Dickie Brennan and Rob Maness, who ran for the Senate here in 2014.

Mr. Cruz, who has wandered into trouble at some private events by saying things he does not say in public, mainly stuck to policy, according to two attendees. But he also spoke more personally than he often did on the stump, describing his connections to Louisiana and praising the city’s music and cuisine.

He even poked a bit of good-natured fun at his wife’s dietary preferences, describing “what it’s like to be from Texas and have Christmas dinner with vegetarians.”",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,The New York Times,Ted Cruz
24,24,1573,"Sanders goes negative with Goldman Sachs, Iraq jabs",http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/sanders-negative-goldman-sachs-iraq/index.html,sanders,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,11.1,11.2,"Carroll, Iowa (CNN) Bernie Sanders has a new bus for the last two weeks before the all-important caucuses in Iowa and also a new strategy: attacking Hillary Clinton where she's most vulnerable. 
Sanders has been inching there for months now, but he finally dropped the nice-guy routine this week -- and with an only slightly coy hit on knitting together Clinton's fabled speaking fees and her Wall Street connections.
""By the way, without naming any names, Goldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates,"" Sanders said, as the crowd chuckled. ""Very generous. Now I know that some of my opponents are very good speakers, very fine orators, very smart people, but you gotta be really really, really good to get $225,000 a speech. That's all I'll say.""
He obviously did not need to name names; a member of the audience yelled, ""It was $600,000!"" 
Sanders laughed and said, ""That's for three speeches."" 
His audience didn't seem to mind that the senator, who declared months ago that he wouldn't go negative, was now doing exactly that.
At the top of his speeches Tuesday in Fort Dodge and Carroll, Sanders spoke about the movement and revolution (as he likes to call it) that his campaign is bringing across America, boasting that 450,000 people have come to see his campaign speeches in the past eight months.
""You may hear me say a word or two about my friend Donald Trump but not my Democratic colleagues, who are serious people,"" Sanders said. He also pointed to the name-calling and candidates ""ripping into each other,"" which seems like a not-so-subtle hit at Trump.
But then only a few minutes later, Sanders criticized Clinton's campaign fundraising tactics and the spending of her super PAC, pointing out that he is proud to not have the support of an official super PAC. At the bottom of his official campaign emails, a note says, ""Paid for by Bernie, not the billionaires.""

Sanders sharp tone comes as he has arisen as a serious threat to swipe the Democratic nomination from Clinton. Facing a possible repeat of 2008, Clinton has unloaded on Sanders as well -- painting him as an impractical radical and someone who could ultimately lose the White House for Democrats.
Clinton's latest hit was a letter from top diplomats questioning Sanders' ability to handle serious international situations, including relations with Iran. 
""The stakes are high. And we are concerned that Sen. Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security,"" the diplomats wrote in their letter. ""His lack of a strategy for defeating ISIS -- one of the greatest challenges we face today -- is troubling. And the limited things he has said on ISIS are also troubling.""
At a stop in Underwood, as Sanders took questions from the crowd, one woman pointed out to him that he's taking some heat for ""not having foreign policy experience."" Sanders' defense rests in the logic that experience does not equal good judgment. 
His example? Dick Cheney, who Sanders remarked, ""had a hell of a lot of experience, God help us all.""
But much like the 2008 election where a fresh-faced senator touted his opposition against the war in Iraq, Sanders reminded the audience of Clinton's voting record on the matter, saying that she dutifully listened to Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld. ""She voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of the United States of America,"" he said.

Mo Elleithee, former communications director for the Democratic Party and a veteran of numerous White House bids, including Clinton's 2008 run, said he doesn't think attacking Clinton will hurt Sanders -- unless he goes too far.
""Unless he crosses a line, I doubt it hurts him. On some level, he wants to be careful, he promises to be something to be different, at a certain point he can take it too far and look like everyone else,"" Elleithee said. 
He added the last two weeks before the Iowa caucuses are when candidates want to excite supporters, but it also ""has the potential for backfiring if he looks too typical.""",11.2,11.1,56.59,0.0,CNN,Bernie Sanders

At the Nevada Democratic Party dinner Wednesday night, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons backers sat on the left side of the giant ballroom, banging bright blue glow sticks together.
They were no match for the other side of the room, where the Sanders crew blared loud vuvuzela horns all evening long. It was an enthusiastic show of support for the Vermont senator, and also an obnoxious, ear-drum piercing pounding.
They blared their horns whenever Mr. Sanderss name was mentioned, and many times when it wasnt. The horns even blared throughout a Sanders campaign video introducing the candidate, rendering it impossible from some 2,200 people assembled to hear many of the words.
Veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston unleashed a Twitter  storm of some two dozen tweets complaining about the noise.
If Bernie can’t shush the vuvuzelas, how can he stand up to Putin? he wrote in one. Bernie says he has no SuperPAC. But he has a super-obnoxious horn section, he said in another.
Even Mr. Sanders commented on the cacophony when he finally took the stage. That music is really beautiful, he said sarcastically.",7.6,8.8,57.27,0.0,The Wall Street Journal,Bernie Sanders
93,93,270,First Draft: My Firsthand Encounter With Donald Trump’s Free Media Machine,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/24/my-firsthand-encounter-with-donald-trumps-free-media-machine/,trump,nyt,Campaign Finance,5.2,7.6,"The other day, a host on MSNBC asked me if Donald J. Trump had a good enough campaign operation to win in Nevada. One thing Mr. Trump had going for him, I pointed out, was that he was very good at getting the news media to give him free airtime. 

“Every time he opens his mouth, he’s on national TV, telling jokes and giving his message — so he’s saved himself tens of millions of dollars doing that,” I said. Almost as soon as I finished making my point, the network demonstrated it by cutting to a Trump rally in Atlanta.

Such is the unusual world of Mr. Trump’s political finances. As a reporter who covers campaign finance, I spend my days trying to figure out where the money is. But Mr. Trump presents a different sort of challenge: Not so much where the money is, but where the money isn’t. 

The only person who has spent less money running for president than Mr. Trump — and who hasn’t yet stopped running for president — is John Kasich. This is partly because Mr. Trump was famous in his own right before he plunged into the 2016 race. It is also partly because many of Mr. Trump’s campaign expenses, such as rides on his own private jets and helicopters, or borrowing aides from his real estate empire, get paid out to his own companies. 

But even beyond that, it is because Mr. Trump doesn’t spend much on television ads, usually the single most expensive budget item for a modern presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump garners what political hacks call “earned media.” He holds big rallies, says provocative things that his audience adores — “I’d like to punch him in the face,” Mr. Trump said of a heckler at his event in Nevada on Monday — and reaps of a wave of news coverage in newspapers and on television. This dynamic has earned the scorn of Trump-haters on the right and left, who have taken to blaming the news media for enabling Mr. Trump’s rise. 

Mr. Trump is undeniably a showman. Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a poll-tested message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the earned-media department, then proceeded to “trump” Mr. Trump, with a 20-minute riff on “squirmishes” and “proud clingers.”)

Just how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals — Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz — are spending a combined $1.5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday.
