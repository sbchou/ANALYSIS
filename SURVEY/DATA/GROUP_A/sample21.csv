110,110,401,Jerry Falwell backs Donald Trump: Satire is dead (Opinion),http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/opinions/falwell-endorses-trump-balmer/index.html,trump,cnn,Immigration,11.5,10.4,"Randall Balmer, chair of the Religion Department and director of the Society of Fellows at Dartmouth College, is the author of more than a dozen books, including ""Redeemer: The Life of Jimmy Carter."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (CNN)  When the Nobel committee conferred its Peace Prize on Henry Kissinger in 1973, singer-songwriter and essayist Tom Lehrer declared that satire had become obsolete. 
How could the committee possibly bestow its highest honor on someone who, in collusion with Richard Nixon, had expanded military operations in Vietnam to Laos and Cambodia at the cost of thousands of lives?  
If satire had somehow managed to make any comeback in the four-plus decades since the Nobel-Kissinger debacle, it suffered another crippling blow on Tuesday when Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed Donald Trump for president. You can't make this up.
Falwell's father and namesake was one of the architects of the Religious Right in the late 1970s, arguing that politically conservative evangelicals should be active in the pursuit of ""biblical values"" in the arena of politics. Although Falwell's politics were misguided -- he mobilized politically to defend the tax-exempt status of his own Liberty Christian Academy and other so-called segregation academies -- the elder Falwell, at times at least, upheld the pretense that his political agenda was shaped by the principles set forth in the Bible, even as he led evangelicals away from their historical concern for the poor, for women and minorities and into the maw of right-wing politics.
His son and successor as head of Liberty University has abandoned all pretense that biblical values inform his politics. The younger Falwell, however, is very much like his father in one crucial respect: He clearly is more interested in political influence than scriptural principles. 
In his endorsement, Falwell Jr. did not anoint Trump as the most righteous candidate; that distinction would probably go to Bernie Sanders, a self-described secular Jew who calls out moneyed interests with the passion of the Hebrew prophets. Falwell, however, hailed Trump as ""a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again."" 
Trump is on his third marriage. Whether or not he qualifies as a ""wonderful father"" is not for me to judge, although he has eerily suggested that, were she not his daughter, he'd consider dating Ivanka Trump (his daughter). Similarly, in 1980, Jerry Falwell Sr., while proclaiming his support for ""family values,"" embraced the divorced and remarried Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter.
And what about biblical values, which are supposed to be at the core of the Religious Right? Jesus was emphatic that his followers busy themselves with caring for people on the margins, a concern that does not appear to be animating the Trump campaign. Jesus described those who would be admitted into the kingdom of heaven as those who demonstrated acts of kindness toward people in need. Those gestures would be reckoned as though they were directed to Jesus himself: ""For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."" 
Jesus spent his entire earthly ministry with outcasts, healing the sick and the lame,while Trump regularly makes fun of people he labels ""losers.""  Whereas Jesus was especially gracious toward children and women, Trump, on the other hand, derides women as ""pigs,"" ""dogs,"" ""slobs,"" ""bimbos"" and ""disgusting animals."" He characterized many Mexican immigrants as ""killers and rapists""  and said nothing as supporters suggested setting a protester at one of his rallies on fire.  Although he tried later to deny it, Trump mocked a journalist for his disability.  
Jesus, by contrast, preached love for one's neighbor. He instructed his followers to care for ""the least of these,"" to look after widows and orphans and to welcome the stranger. 
In the midst of his effusive endorsement, the younger Falwell failed to explain how Trump's construction of a wall on our southern border or his plan for massive deportations lined up with those biblical principles. 
Jerry Falwell Jr.'s backing of Donald Trump demonstrates that the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree. The elder Falwell's 1980 embrace of Reagan over Carter, an evangelical Sunday school teacher, represented the triumph of political opportunism over biblical principles. His son's endorsement of Trump looks much the same.
Satire is dead.

103,103,527,"Really, Donald Trump? A fight with the Pope?",http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/opinions/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-dantonio/index.html,trump,cnn,Immigration,8.7,8.8,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (CNN)  Donald Trump once told me, ""I always loved to fight.""  But even those of us who know him and his fighting mentality have to marvel at his ability to find new battles. I mean really, Donald, you're going to argue with the Pope? About Christianity?
To be fair, from the Trumpian viewpoint, Pope Francis sort of started it. He decided to make a pilgrimage to Mexico and to include a visit to the border where Trump proposes to build a huge wall to keep people out. A champion of the poor and the suffering, Francis has visited slums all over the world and washed the feet of homeless men and women. 
But for Trump, the trip to Mexico, where just about everyone is Catholic and about half the population lives in poverty, was a step too far.    
""I think that the Pope is a very political person,"" Trump said in a TV interview last week. 
He then wondered whether maybe Francis was a pawn of the Mexican government. ""I don't think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico,"" said Trump. ""I think Mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is. They're making a fortune, and we're losing.""
Trump's pre-emptive strike, made before the Pope even left Rome, was a play for votes in South Carolina, where religious tradition includes longstanding suspicions about the Catholic Church.  Criticizing the Pope also gave Trump yet another turn in the media spotlight, which is a place he finds quite comfortable. 
Besides, who else was the fighter going to tangle with? 
His Republican opponents seem incapable of giving Trump a real contest, and nobody in the news media was causing him to sweat. Trump was probably getting bored. Thanks to Francis, he's not bored now.
Though as different from Trump as love is from anger, Francis is similar to him in one way: He says what he thinks. Early in his papacy, he shocked fellow Catholics when reporters asked him about homosexuality -- a subject long anathema to the Vatican -- and he answered, ""Who am I to judge?"" 
When told of Trump's criticisms as he flew home from Mexico on Thursday, the Pope said, ""Thank God he said I am a political man. Because Aristotle defines a human being as a political animal: At least I am a human being. Am I a pawn? Well maybe. I will leave that up to your judgment. And a person who only thinks about making wall, wherever it may be, and not building bridges, is not a Christian."" 
Like Trump, the Pope does not speak without purpose. 
He has doubtlessly followed the American presidential campaign more closely that Trump has followed the news from the Vatican. And just as Trump fights to win whatever prize he has in mind, the Pope has fought doggedly on behalf of the poor.
He has criticized world leaders for failing to lift-up humanity, and he has chastised leaders of his own Church for living lavishly while members of their flocks suffer.  His Christianity is defined by the Jesus who threw the money changers out of the temple. 
In his own effort to be Christian, he aligns himself with refugees and victims of drug trafficking and has expressed that he would err on the side of open arms and open borders.  This has been his response to the refugee crisis in Europe. Is it any wonder he would criticize Trump's plan mass deportations and massive wall? 
In this latest controversy, Trump, has followed his usual strategy of keeping up the fight, no matter what.
He answered the Pope by saying: ""He doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation"" and complaining that ""for a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. ... No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn, and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant."" 
Of course, Francis considers Christianity his area of expertise in the same way that Trump imagines that money and power are his. And he is less inclined than Trump to be shy about stating his beliefs. When he celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus, last December, he offered a very un-Trumpian homily that included this:
""In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this Child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential. ... Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy, drawn daily from the wellspring of prayer.""
Maybe Trump heard the Christmas homily and took it personally. Maybe he understood that the Pontiff -- Latin for bridge-builder -- would join the battle of ideas. 
Certainly Francis is not likely to back down. He is as transformational for the church as Trump is in politics. Humble and empathetic, he might apologize for hurting Trump's feelings. But he won't abandon his position. He will always prefer bridges to walls.

31,31,1686,CNN/WMUR Poll: Cruz climbs in NH,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/new-hampshire-poll-trump-leads-cruz-climbs/index.html,cruz,cnn,Foreign Policy/National Security,4.8,7.2,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump holds a 20-point lead in the New Hampshire Republican primary, a new CNN/WMUR poll shows. 
Behind him, there's still a scrum for second place -- with support for No. 2, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, on the rise.
Trump is backed by 34% of those likely to vote in New Hampshire's February 9 GOP primary, more than double his nearest contender, Cruz, who has 14% support. 
 
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are tied for third with 10% each. 
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul are each tied at 6%, followed by Carly Fiorina with 4% support, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 1%.  
But the poll's results suggest there's volatility: Just 31% of the Republicans surveyed say they've made up their minds about who they'll support.
Cruz is the candidate who has grown the most since a December poll: He's climbed from 6% to 14%, largely on the strength of a favorability rating that has jumped from 46% in December to 55% now. 
Trump, though, dominates on the two issues that likely voters have identified as most important: the economy and the threat of ISIS. 
Nearly half -- 48% -- of Republicans say Trump would best handle the economy, far ahead of Bush, Cruz and Kasich, with just 7% each. And 32% say he'd best handle ISIS, ahead of Cruz's 14%, Bush's 12% and Rubio's 10%. 
The poll carries both good and bad news for Bush: He's cracked double-digit support for the first time since last summer. But he is viewed unfavorably by 51% of the state's Republican voters, with 40% viewing him favorably. 
The survey of 413 likely New Hampshire Republican primary voters was conducted January 13-18 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Its margin of error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",7.2,4.8,83.66,0.0,CNN
5,5,1387,Bernie Sanders Raised $20 Million in January,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/31/bernie-sanders-raised-20-million-in-january/,sanders,wsj,Campaign Finance,8.0,8.0,"Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders raised $20 million in January, a large sum that suggests strong support for the Vermont senator as the first nominating contests approach.
That haul, confirmed by his campaign, is nearly two-thirds the amount his campaign raised in the final three months of 2015. To date, Mr. Sanders has raised $95 million.
The $20 million haul came from more than 770,000 contributions, with an average donation of $27, his campaign said. Mr. Sanders has received more than 3.25 million donations since starting his campaign, a record number.
Mr. Sanders’s rival, Hillary Clinton, has not reported how much she raised in January and is not required to do so until next month.
Mrs. Clinton was expected to have the strongest fundraising operation in the field. Indeed, she has outraised her rivals in both parties, bringing in $112 million last year. A super PAC supporting her candidacy has raised an additional $50 million.
But Mr. Sanders has posed a more significant fundraising threat than expected, raising within a few million dollars of what Mrs. Clinton brought in each quarter.
Mr. Sanders has the advantage over Mrs. Clinton of relying on small donations, rather than on individuals donating the maximum $2,700 for the primary. That allows his campaign to tap previous donors for more funds, rather than finding new supporters. His campaign said Sunday that just 1.3% of its fourth-quarter donations were from donors who had hit the legal maximum.
The campaign has not yet filed its fourth-quarter fundraising disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, nor has Mrs. Clintons. Those reports are due by midnight Sunday.
Working Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in a statement Sunday.
Tad Devine, a senior strategist to Mr. Sanders, said in a recent interview that the senator’s fundraising prowess boosts his credibility going forward.
“Part of our argument if were going to win this thing in the long run is to convince the Democratic establishment that the new model of fundraising that he can do is on a scale that doesn’t jeopardize our ability to run a national campaign,” he said.",8.0,8.0,64.71,0.0,The Wall Street Journal
94,94,255,First Draft: Donald Trump Turns His Fire on Nikki Haley,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/18/donald-trump-turns-his-fire-on-nikki-haley/,trump,nyt,Immigration,5.2,6.4,"SUMTER, S.C. — Donald J. Trump, who had kind words for Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina early in the week, ripped into her as weak on immigration on Wednesday after she endorsed Senator Marco Rubio, and the crowd of Trump supporters booed the mention of her name.

“She’s very, very weak on illegal immigration,’’ Mr. Trump said, echoing earlier charges that were a departure from his gentler remarks about South Carolina’s governor in speeches this week. “Very weak,’’ he continued. “She’s very, very weak on illegal immigration. You can’t have that.’’

Ms. Haley, whose endorsement is a major boost for Mr. Rubio as Republicans head to the polls on Saturday, has served as a foil in Trump speeches ever since she urged voters last month to avoid “the angriest voices.” 

Mr. Trump joyfully embraces his anger in most speeches as reflecting the mood of the country. In a speech in Greenville on Monday, he called Ms. Haley, who is popular with South Carolina Republicans, “a very nice woman” and “a friend of mine.’’ He said she had modified her original accusation that he was too angry, which she made in the official Republican response to President Obama’s State of the Union address. 

By Wednesday night, Mr. Trump’s blandishments had changed. So had his audience’s mood. “You know, Nikki Haley gave a speech a couple of weeks ago and she said that we——’’ Mr. Trump began, waving an arm to include the crowd.  

There was a chorus of boos.  

“It’s not good,’’ Mr. Trump said.  Then he flung into his criticism of her.       ",6.4,5.2,77.23,0.0,The New York Times
