3,3,1480,First Draft: Bernie Sanders Releases Tough Ad on Wall Street Speaking Fees,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/28/bernie-sanders-releases-tough-ad-on-wall-street-speaking-fees/,sanders,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,6.8,8.0,"DES MOINES — Speaking with reporters on Thursday morning, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was asked if he would satisfy some of his frustrated supporters by making a more direct contrast with Hillary Clinton in the final days before the Iowa caucuses.

“I do not intend to run a negative political ad,” Mr. Sanders said at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg Politics.

Did that mean he would run a stronger contrast ad, Mr. Sanders was asked.

“Well, uhhh, contrast ad. Um, I have, by the way, let me just say this, uh, we have run some really beautiful ads, positive ads,” Mr. Sanders said, before then explaining his history of benefiting from positive ads. 

He answered a series of other questions about his foreign policy views and how the political establishment was stacked against him, before being asked again whether he planned to run more “contrast ads” in Iowa.

“Do I plan on running more contrast ads?” he said. “I don’t think we do, but that’s something we are still talking about.”

The conversation is apparently over. On Thursday morning, the Sanders campaign released an ad with the less-than-beatific title “The Problem,” which criticized the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs and other banks for corrupting politics with “millions in campaign contributions and speaking fees.”

Mr. Sanders has done much to lay the groundwork to associate Mrs. Clinton with Wall Street, highlighting her acceptance of speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and it’s role in the mortgage crisis. And on the stump and interviews now, Mr. Sanders has added a new line noting that Hillary Clinton went to Philadelphia last night for a fund-raiser at an investment bank.",8.0,6.8,73.17,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders
69,69,1146,First Draft: Hillary Clinton to Highlight Core Supporters on Anniversary of Roe v. Wade,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/22/hillary-clinton-to-highlight-core-supporters-on-anniversary-of-roe-v-wade/,clinton,nyt,Abortion,8.7,8.8,"As the Democratic presidential primary race has taken a harsher turn in the last few days, Hillary Clinton will try to focus on the group of supporters she hopes will lift her candidacy — women — as she campaigns in New Hampshire.

Mrs. Clinton will appear at a dinner in Manchester hosted by Naral Pro-Choice New Hampshire, to celebrate the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The dinner will also feature the state’s Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen.

(Mrs. Clinton is not the only candidate who will be focusing on the anniversary. Carly Fiorina, the only woman running on the Republican side and a candidate who has been deeply critical of Planned Parenthood, is scheduled to appear at a March for Life event in Washington, weather permitting.)

But for Mrs. Clinton, the rally is a chance to focus on her base of voters as polls show her losing ground to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mrs. Clinton has made protecting abortion rights a key component of her campaign and she has received the backing of the Naral Pro-Choice America PAC. 

Mr. Sanders has seized on the endorsements from Naral and from Planned Parenthood’s political arm as evidence that Mrs. Clinton is part of the so-called establishment who is backed by special interest groups. Her campaign has fought that label, with allies pointing out that protecting abortion rights is also a central part of the Democratic Party’s agenda.

It has been a rough week for Mrs. Clinton. But rather than seek distance from the “establishment” mantle, Mrs. Clinton has tightly embraced it. Whether that will work in an election cycle characterized by so much voter anger remains to be seen.",8.8,8.7,62.68,0.0,The New York Times,Hillary Clinton
115,115,741,Trump criticized for campaign ad showing ‘southern border’ using footage of Morocco,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/lb08SQsvf88/trump-criticized-for-campaign-ad-showing-southern-border-using-footage-morocco.html,trump,fox,Immigration,12.3,12.4,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s new television ad showing dozens of people swarming over a border fence is being criticized by a prominent fact-checker for using footage from a Spanish autonomous city that shares a border with Morocco. 
The ad features a narrator who says of Trump, ""He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for,” as images show people streaming across a border fence. 
PolitiFact said the footage comes from the Italian television network RepubblicaTV, which posted video on May 3, 2015 of Moroccans crossing the border into the Spanish city of Melilla. 
""Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over 'our southern border.' However, the footage used to support this point actually shows African migrants streaming over a border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla, more than 5,000 miles away. We rate the claim Pants on Fire,"" PolitiFact said in its ruling on the ad. 
But the Trump campaign defended the ad, the candidate's first TV ad of the 2016 cycle. 
In a statement to Fox News on Monday, Trump’s campaign said the use of the footage was ""intentional and selected to demonstrate the severe impact of an open border and the very real threat Americans face if we do not immediately build a wall and stop illegal immigration.""
""The biased main stream media doesn’t understand, but Americans who want to protect their jobs and their families do,"" the statement continued. 
The ad is part of the campaign's $2 million-a-week buy in early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire.",12.4,12.3,53.55,0.0,Fox News,Donald Trump
72,72,1153,First on CNN: Conservative super PAC to air ad hitting Clinton on paid speech transcripts,http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/26/politics/hillary-clinton-pac-ad-speech-transcripts/index.html,clinton,cnn,Campaign Finance,9.9,10.0,"Charleston, South Carolina  (CNN) A conservative super PAC tied to a number of top Republican donors will start airing an ad Saturday that knocks Hillary Clinton for delivering paid speeches to Wall Street and corporate groups and refusing to release the transcripts of those speeches.
The ad, which will air on CNN and MSNBC through Super Tuesday and was made by the group Future45, is the most recent attempt by Republicans to force Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches. 
""Hillary Clinton gave speeches to the biggest banks on Wall Street after one of the worst financial crises in American history,"" a narrator says over video of a Clinton look-alike opening a check from Goldman Sachs. ""But Hillary won't tell us what she said to those banks. They paid her over 1 million dollars and are contributing millions more to elect her.""
The ad concludes, ""So before you promise your vote to Hillary, don't you deserve to know what she promised to them?""
Clinton's campaign dismissed the ad Thursday as another attempt by Republicans to boost Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's Democratic opponent.
""This is just another instance of Republican Super PACs echoing Bernie Sanders' personal attacks against Hillary Clinton,"" said Brian Fallon, Clinton's press secretary. ""The Wall Street hedge funds bankrolling these ads are propping up Senator Sanders because it is Hillary Clinton they fear the most.""
A coalition of Sanders-aligned progressives and Republicans have ratcheted up the pressure on Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches. Future 45, the group behind the ad, is a Republican super PAC backed by Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, two hedge fund managers, and Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade.
The ad, according to representatives from Future45, will run at ""key times, including election night coverage"" and will have an accompanying digital campaign.
""Transparency seems to be a big problem for Hillary Clinton,"" said Brian O. Walsh, president of Future45. ""First the donations to the Foundation, then the ongoing email scandal and now, as a candidate for the presidency of the United States, Clinton wants to hide speeches she gave while being paid over one million dollars for from the big banks!?""
Clinton spent much of 2013 and 2014 giving paid speeches to a variety of corporations and trade organizations, including some of the nation's biggest banks and Wall Street companies.
A CNN analysis found Clinton collected at least $1.8 million for at least eight speeches to big banks, including Goldman Sachs and UBS, from the time after her husband, former President Bill Clinton, left the White House until she announced her presidential campaign last spring. 
Bernie Sanders, Clinton's Democratic opponent, recently joined the call after refusing to get into it for weeks.
""I am happy to release all of my paid speeches to Wall Street -- here it is,"" Sanders said on Thursday, with a wave of his hands. ""There ain't none.""
Clinton's response to questions about why she won't release the transcripts - which her team required groups to create after every paid speech - has been that she will do it if everyone -- including Republicans -- release their paid speech transcripts.
""If everybody does it, and that includes the Republicans -- because we know they have made a lot of speeches,"" Clinton said.
That answer has been less than satisfactory for many, however.
On Thursday, the New York Times editorial board faulted Clinton for not releasing the transcripts, arguing that ""voters have every right to know what Mrs. Clinton told these groups.""
""By refusing to release them all, especially the bank speeches, Mrs. Clinton fuels speculation about why she's stonewalling,"" read the editorial.",10.0,9.9,59.64,0.0,CNN,Hillary Clinton

More than $6 million of that money was raised on Monday, the last day of the month, when the campaign issued a push for donations with the goal of bringing February’s total to $40 million. The funds raised in February came from 1.4 million individual contributors who donated an average of $30 each, according to the campaign, which drew a contrast with what it called the wealthier donors supporting Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.

“Working Americans chipping in a few dollars every week are changing the way campaigns in our country are financed,” Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said in a statement issued after midnight. “Not only are we going to smash Secretary Clinton’s personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination.”

Mr. Weaver added that Mr. Sanders’s supporters are “a firewall protecting Bernie from the Clinton campaign’s wealthiest donors and super PACs.”",9.6,9.5,60.65,0.0,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders
