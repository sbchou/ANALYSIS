41,41,2006,"Ted Cruz: To Help Stop Drug Abuse, Build the Mexico Border Wall",http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/04/ted-cruz-to-help-stop-drug-abuse-build-the-mexico-border-wall/,cruz,wsj,Immigration,8.4,8.4,"HOOKSETT, N.H.  Ted Cruz spent 18 minutes telling an emotional, gripping story of his familys history of drug and alcohol abuse. His older half-sister and later his father, he told an addiction policy forum, got hooked and became addicted. His sister died, his father survived only after becoming religious, Mr. Cruz said in a Baptist church here.
So it was jarring to hear Mr. Cruz then pivot to his policy solution: building a wall along the nations southern border to stop illegal immigration and halt the flow of drugs from Mexico.
If we want to turn around the drug crisis we have got to finally and permanently secure the border, Mr. Cruz said. We need to solve this problem, we need to build this wall.
Mr. Cruzs appearance at a drug addiction forum comes as New Hampshire voters have classified heroin as the states top problem. Rarely does a presidential candidate get through a town hall forum without being asked how theyd address the problem. Mr. Cruz said 48% of residents here know someone addicted to heroin  60% of people who are 35 years old or younger.
To connect with the audience, Mr. Cruz told of his older half-sister Miriam. The Texas senator, who wrote about her plight in his book last year, told of trying to rescue her from living in a Philadelphia crack house and subsidizing her sons boarding school before she died of a drug overdose in 2011.
Sometimes people make decisions, bound and determined, to destroy themselves, he said. You wonder as a family, Could I have done more? Was there a way to pull her back, to change the path she was on? Those are questions you can never fully answer.
Mr. Cruz then placed blame for the drug problem on the various groups he accused of abetting illegal immigration: Democrats (Theres a new politically correct term now for illegal immigrants: Its called undocumented Democrats, he said to awkward laughter) and business-oriented Republicans.

Whats if anything even more cynical is all the Republicans who listen to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who listen to Wall Street, who listen to the lobbyists in Washington, Mr. Cruz said. They think its fabulous. Cheap labor drives down wages, what could be better? But its that political commitment that results in our not securing the border and not stopping the flow of drugs into this country.
Mr. Cruz has made combating illegal immigration a hallmark of his campaign. A onetime advocate of legalizing some undocumented immigrants, in 2015 he renounced that position when rival Donald Trump proposed deporting some 11 million people in the country illegally. Mr. Cruz has cited his opposition to the 2013 Senate immigration legislation that Sen. Marco Rubio co-authored as evidence of his bedrock conservative credentials.
Mr. Cruzs appeared here at what organizers billed as a non-political event to which all presidential campaigns were invited.
Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who is a Hillary Clinton surrogate, spoke before Mr. Cruz arrived. Mr. Shumlin blamed the Food and Drug Administration for approving drugs like Oxycontin, a highly addictive painkiller that can lead to heroin abuse. Oxycontin was approved by the FDA in 1995, when Mrs. Clintons husband Bill Clinton was president.
Following his remarks Mr. Cruz sat on a nine-person panel discussing ways to address New Hampshires drug crisis. He told the group, which included drug counselors and former addicts, that he supports legislation to funnel more federal money into drug prevention programs but reiterated that the problem is one that can only be solved at local levels.
Its not going to be the government that solves this, Mr. Cruz said. Its going to take people on the ground connecting one person at a time. ¦ People have to make personal transformations.",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The Wall Street Journal,Ted Cruz
16,16,1526,Message of Bernie Sanders’s New Ad: The Housing Crisis Isn’t Over,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/19/message-of-bernie-sanderss-new-ad-the-housing-crisis-isnt-over/,sanders,wsj,Immigration,9.1,9.2,"The housing crisis has faded from the national conversation, but it is resurfacing as a potentially potent issue ahead of Saturday’s Democratic caucus in Nevada, where Bernie Sanders has released a new ad that speaks to its lingering devastation.
The ad, entitled “Our Home,” shows pictures of boarded up ranch-style homes and features homeowners speaking in English and Spanish about the experience of losing their homes.
The 60-second spot also highlights the interesting political moment, where a candidate running for the nomination of the incumbent party isn’t really running on the record of the party’s outgoing president. This is no “Morning in America.”
The housing crisis is nowhere near as acute as it was four or eight years ago, but Las Vegas is still ground zero. Around 22% of borrowers in the metro area owe more than their home is worth, the highest rate in the nation, according to Zillow. Of course, this is down from an astoundingly high 69% in 2012.
The drop reflects both the strong rebound in home prices over the last four years and the write-down of bad mortgage debt, primarily through foreclosure. Even in the hardest hit states such as Nevada and Florida, the share of mortgages that are delinquent or in foreclosure has also fallen sharply and are finally close to their pre-crisis levels.


But the ad illustrates how the memories of homes lost or marriages that fell apart aren’t fading even if the raw statistics show the acute crisis has passed. It doesn’t have to say what Mr. Sanders would do differently, now or then. Instead, it reinforces Mr. Sanders’s central campaign theme: the nation’s institutions, especially Wall Street, failed the country, and the government didn’t do nearly enough to respond for ordinary citizens.
The ad is heavy, but Mr. Sanders’s reading the “I approved this ad” disclaimed in Spanish is worth a grin. (Which New Yorker did it better?)
One observation the ad doesn’t make: Home prices have rebounded strongly in the U.S. and in Nevada over the past four years to a degree that few imagined was possible in 2012. Yale economist Robert Shiller said at the time he was worried “we might not see a major turnaround in our lifetimes.”
Many of Mr. Obama’s strongest critics on the left argued that without a massive program of debt forgiveness, prices wouldn’t recover meaningfully because foreclosures wouldn’t end.
Instead, low interest rates, an improving job market, and strong demand from investors soaked up the oversupply of homes, though pockets of distress remain. Now, many Western markets face a different housing crisis—a shortage of affordable homes, for sale or for rent.
In that sense, the ad effectively captures the frustrations many Americans still have with the economy. A few years ago, the idea that gas prices would fall below $1.75 a gallon, home prices would rise 20%, and the unemployment rate would drop below 5% would have seemed like implausible fantasy. All of those things happened, but Mr. Obama has received very little credit because the prosperity doesn’t seem to be broadly shared.",8.8,8.7,62.68,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal,Bernie Sanders
88,88,1317,"TOO MUCH SHARING AT STATE? New video suggests Clinton, aides used BlackBerries for sensitive info",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/26/video-suggests-clinton-shared-info-that-would-never-be-on-unclassified-system-normally.html,clinton,fox,Foreign Policy/National Security,13.4,11.2,"A 2013 video, obtained exclusively by Fox News, raises fresh questions about how Hillary Clinton handled sensitive information at the State Department. 
In the video, veteran diplomat Wendy Sherman reveals that in the interest of speed, Clinton and her aides would share information that ""would never be on an unclassified system"" normally. 
The questions surround a 2013 speech in which Sherman compared the technology differences between serving at the State Department in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Obama. 
""Now we have BlackBerries, and it has changed the way diplomacy is done,"" Sherman, who was undersecretary of state at the time, said in the 2013 on-camera remarks. ""Things appear on your BlackBerries that would never be on an unclassified system. But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.""
Clinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI. 
The Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time. Questions also have been raised about whether classified emails were hacked by China, Russia, Iran and other nations. 
In Sherman's speech to the American Foreign Service Association, she cited as an example Clinton's September 2011 visit to the United Nations General Assembly. 
The secretary of state met with Lady Ashton of the European Union and, according to Sherman, the two high officials used their BlackBerries to conduct Middle East peace negotiations. 
""So they sat there, as they were having the meeting, with their BlackBerries, transferring language back and forth between them and between their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion,"" said Sherman. ""To have the meeting and at the same time be working on the Quartet statement.""
The Middle East Quartet is involved in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and consists of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., and Russia.
Previous email releases by the State Department of Clinton's official correspondence show that in September 2011, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan forwarded her an email chain on the Quartet statement. 
The State Department considered the correspondence sensitive enough that the department deemed some of those emails to now be classified, and officials redacted details before the emails were released to the public. 
The conservative super PAC America Rising declared that under National Archives guidelines, the information deemed classified involves ""foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,"" so it was born classified when the emails were created. 
""Despite her numerous protests, evidence continues to grow showing Secretary Clinton knowingly sent and received classified material using her private email,"" Jeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, said in a written statement. ""This new video again puts Clinton on defense, forcing the former Secretary of State to explain why she put U.S. intelligence at risk by exclusively [using] a private email account for government business.""
A Clinton aide would not comment on the video, which was revealed as new Fox News polls showed a tightening race between Clinton and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire. 
The polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important.

96,96,240,First Draft: Donald Trump Holds Firm on Criticism of George W. Bush,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/14/donald-trump-holds-firm-on-criticism-of-george-w-bush/,trump,nyt,Foreign Policy/National Security,5.6,6.8,"The morning after the Republican presidential primary debate, Donald J. Trump said he had no regrets about saying that the George W. Bush administration “lied” in taking the nation to war in Iraq, despite the criticism Mr. Trump received.

“I could be very quiet, I could say, ‘Oh that’s wonderful,’ or I could say, ‘Excuse me, the World Trade Center'” came down during President George W. Bush’s tenure, Mr. Trump said.

During the debate, discussing the war in Iraq, Mr. Trump said, “George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty.”

“We should have never been in Iraq,” Mr. Trump said. “They lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none and they knew that there were none.” Jeb Bush defended his brother, as did Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a reflection of the former president’s durable popularity with Republicans in South Carolina, where primary voters will cast ballots on Saturday.

The remark was seen as potentially harmful to Mr. Trump with voters who still view Mr. Bush positively and who see “they lied” as similar to the type of attack that Democrats lobbed against Mr. Bush in 2004 and beyond. But Mr. Trump said on Sunday that he was unconcerned about any damage it could cause his candidacy here.

“If it does, it does — I have to tell the truth,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m a big boy.”

He reiterated that the war was a “terrible, terrible mistake” that cost the nation dearly in American lives and money, a comment he has frequently made during the campaign.

However, he softened his comment about Mr. Bush slightly, saying his remarks were “not against Bush, per se. It’s against the war.” But he again added, “He was the one that made that mistake.”",6.8,5.6,76.22,0.0,The New York Times,Donald Trump

BEHIND TRUMP’S ATTACK STRATEGY: Donald Trump made his decision to start skewering Sen. Ted Cruz as his private jet was approaching Nashua, N.H., earlier this month. “Ted is hanging around the top too long,” the Republican presidential front-runner announced on the plane, according to his campaign manager. “Time to take him down.” Mr. Trump’s airborne verdict to strike at his closest GOP rival and a look at other decisions like it reveal a truth behind his famously pointed attacks: Mr. Trump, not his staff or consultants, personally drives them, and they are both calculated and improvised to adapt to news and polls, with little research or extensive prep work.

Mr. Trump proceeded to question whether Mr. Cruz’s Canadian birth disqualified him. A week later, he tore into the Texas senator about a loan he took from Goldman Sachs to finance his political career and about his notoriety as a Senate “nasty guy.” The onslaught seemed to stall Mr. Cruz’s rise in Iowa, where polls show Mr. Trump holding an advantage. In a repeated pattern, Mr. Trump has fired personal attacks at rivals when they emerge as a challenge. While his attacks and policy pronouncements often appear to be off-the-cuff, hours spent interviewing Mr. Trump and watching him behind the scenes show how he plots them, most often alone in his jet as he flies to early primary states.

GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FIGHT TO AVOID WINNOWING IN IOWA: After a year that saw political convention turned on its head, Iowa in a week will finally deliver the first official verdict of the 2016 Republican presidential campaign. Front-runners Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz are mounting a furious effort to place first, while others are vying for a third-place finish in the Feb. 1 caucuses that could beat expectations and slow any momentum for potential rivals. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush trails far behind in Iowa, but the super PAC backing him has spent more than $20 million slamming Sen. Marco Rubio, hoping to damage his fellow Floridian before primary contests later in February. Reid J. Epstein and Jennifer Levitz report.

Plus: Traditionally, the people most likely to show up on a cold, Iowa night for the first-in-the-nation nominating contests have previously attended caucuses. But if Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump can persuade newcomers to turn out, they could gain substantially.


BRENDAN HOFFMAN/GETTY IMAGES
CLINTON’S TACTIC OF EMPHASIZING EXPERIENCE IS QUESTIONED: In her closing pitch to Iowa voters, Hillary Clinton is casting herself as the one Democrat who has the experience to make the life-or-death choices that come with the presidency. It echoes the argument she made in 2008, when she ran an ad saying a president must be ready for a “3 a.m. phone call” warning of imminent peril. It didn’t work then and some people close to the Clintons worry it won’t succeed now. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has narrowed Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Iowa ahead of the state’s Feb. 1 caucuses. He could scramble the race should he notch a victory there and in New Hampshire. His theme is direct: He is the champion of voters who are disillusioned with Washington politics and impatient with an economy that lavishes rewards on a tiny fraction of families. Peter Nicholas reports.
 
VOTERS REACT TO POSSIBILITY OF BLOOMBERG RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY: Opposition, uncertainty and curiosity were among the reactions that voters in early primary states offered upon the news that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg might enter the presidential race as an independent. “I don’t know him very well,” said Juni Pierce, 73 years old, a retired gym teacher from Merrimack, N.H., who added that she believed the Republican-turned-Independent is now a Democrat. A gambit by Mr. Bloomberg, who wouldn’t face voters until the general election, would likely rest on his ability to attract centrists from both parties who admire his tight fiscal policies and liberal social attitudes. Among voters from across the political spectrum interviewed over the weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire, solid Republicans largely turned up their noses. Heather Haddon and Jennifer Levitz report.

Plus: Michael Bloomberg’s possible foray into the race drew support from an unlikely corner: Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner whose candidacy is said to have inspired a potential bid from the former New York mayor.

WHAT WE’RE READING AROUND THE WEB

The Weekly Standard’s Michael Warren accompanied Sen. Ted Cruz  on a tour of New Hampshire and found an improved political performer: He’s gotten better at telling jokes, and is “becoming more skilled at answering questions that might deviate from his preferred script.”

Little-remembered Morry Taylor, a corporate executive who mounted his own quixotic, Donald Trump-like bid for president in 1996, tells Bloomberg’s Laurence Arnold that “he’d like to see a Trump-Carly Fiorina ticket, because CEOs ‘understand incompetency,’ which is what presidents must tackle throughout the federal bureaucracy.”

The Washington Examiner’s Byron York writes about his recent visit to New Hampshire, where he spoke with Republicans including former Gov. John Sununu who don’t understand the Trump phenomenon and say the polls may be wrong. He concludes that they may not understand it because “if it is real, it would say something about their state that they don’t quite understand.”

Although the New Hampshire tradition of trial by town meeting seems diminished in the 2016 presidential primary race, the primary’s “old ways and old role” are far from dead because the roots just run too deep, writes David M. Shribman in an essay on the primary’s history and distinct characteristics in the Boston Globe.

In the WSJ’s Think Tank, Stephen Sestanovich says a retired British judge was wrong to say in a newly released report that Russian President Vladimir Putin “probably” ordered the poisoning death of one of his domestic enemies in London: “Fingering Mr. Putin is a leap—not a crazy leap; just one without the firm foundation on which the rest of the report rests.”
