67,67,1143,First Draft: Hillary Clinton Promises Not to Be ‘Deporter in Chief’,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/12/hillary-clinton-promises-not-to-be-deporter-in-chief/,clinton,nyt,Immigration,8.4,8.4,"Under pressure to consolidate her support among Latinos as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont gains ground on her in Iowa, Hillary Clinton broke with the Obama administration on a key immigration provision on Monday night and promised not to be the “deporter in chief” if elected president.

Speaking at the Iowa Black and Brown Forum, an event focused on minority issues and hosted by the television network Fusion, Mrs. Clinton said deportation raids were “sowing discord and fear” and argued that they were not an appropriate method of enforcing immigration laws. The Obama administration apprehended more than 100 adults and children from Central America and Mexico over the holidays as part of an effort to deport a new wave of immigrants who entered the United States illegally.

As she spoke at the forum, which also separately featured her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Sanders and Martin O’Malley, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign released a four-point plan for assisting Central American families in need.

“It is important to put this in the broader context,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We have to have comprehensive immigration reform.”

Mrs. Clinton declined to promise that she would not deport children, but she said she would ensure that they had sufficient counsel and were given “due process” and a chance to tell their story and avoid deportation.

“What I don’t like are the mass roundups and the raids that just pick people up and send them out in the middle of the night,” she said.

In December, Mrs. Clinton said she was “concerned” about reports of the raids but did not condemn them outright.

The three Democratic presidential candidates have been canvassing Iowa ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses. Mr. Sanders has come within three percentage points of Mrs. Clinton in the most recent poll of Iowa Democrats, and the contest has grown increasingly caustic.

“It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic nomination may not be so inevitable today,” Mr. Sanders said at the event, referring to Mrs. Clinton’s more aggressive approach.

Mr. O’Malley, a former governor of Maryland, did his best to bolster his flagging candidacy and take advantage of some rare national exposure. Asked if he thought Mrs. Clinton would continue President Obama’s deportation policy, he appeared to take offense to the question.

“No, because she is not going to win the election,” Mr. O’Malley said. “I am.”

The Democrats did their best to focus on substantive policy issues and avoid attacks on Republicans. After trying to not to mention his name earlier in the evening, however, Mrs. Clinton could not help taking a dig at Donald J. Trump. 

In response to a question about what she gave Mr. Trump as a gift when attending his 2005 wedding, she said, “Nothing.” Then she elaborated on their previous relationship and offered some fodder that other Republicans might use against the billionaire real estate mogul, who is leading most polls in the Republican race.

“He was basically a Democrat before he was a Republican,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He was somebody that we all knew in New York. He was supportive of Democrats. He was supportive of a lot of the causes that I cared about and the people I know cared about. Now he seems to have taken another road.”",8.4,8.4,63.7,0.0,The New York Times
60,60,1107,Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright’s Exhortation to Women to Back Clinton,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/06/critics-pounce-on-madeleine-albrights-exhortation-to-women-to-back-clinton/,clinton,wsj,Campaign Finance,6.0,7.2,"CONCORD, N.H.  Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered a warning to young women who arent inclined to elect Hillary Clinton the first female president.
Just remember, Ms. Albright told the crowd at a get-out-the-vote rally for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Theres a special place in hell for women who dont help each other.
The familiar phrase was a hit in the room, drawing cheers from Mrs. Clintons supporters. But online, the reaction was much different.
Played in short video clips online or quoted in tweets, the quote almost sounded like a threat to other women: help Hillary Clinton or else.
Some on social media asked if they should also be helping the other woman in the 2016 race, former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina. Others expressed surprise at the idea that a women should be forced to vote for a woman — instead of being free to chose based on issues. And some on Twitter took it a step further, with references to Bill Clinton’s history with women during his time in the White House.
@madeleine I’m a good woman! But apparently I have a special place in hell? Thanks-but My God can decide that. #SetBackToWomen #FeelTheBern

But, Ms. Albright, who served in the Clinton administration was quoting herself. It’s from a speech she gave in 2006 as a keynote speaker. As backlash spread, Jesse Lehrich, Mrs. Clinton’s rapid response director, tweeted “peeps freaking out about that Madeleine Albright quote: It’s not new — it was literally on a Starbucks cup.”
Nick Merrill, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, pointed out on Twitter that Ms. Albright had said this “literally hundreds of times.”
With only three days remaining until New Hampshires primary, Mrs. Clinton deployed some of her high-profile supporters, including Ms. Albright and Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), during a busy day on the campaign trail.
In Concord, Ms. Albright shared stories of working with Mrs. Clinton during her eight years as first lady. And Ms. Albright made a forceful push for making history by electing a woman to the countrys highest office.
People are talking about revolution, so what kind of a revolution would it be to have the first woman president of the United States? Ms. Albright said, referring to Sen. Bernie Sanderss call for a political revolution.
In an effort to reach the young people the Clinton campaign is aiming to attract from its rival, the campaign advertised the event on the Students for Bernie Sanders subreddit group on the website Reddit and streamed it online on Facebook and received more than 100,000 views.
Ms. Albright said some young women dont understand the importance of supporting Mrs. Clinton, adding that theres more work to be done to break gender barriers.
Its not done, and you have to help, Ms. Albright said. Hillary Clinton will always be there for you.",6.8,5.6,76.22,-0.4,The Wall Street Journal

The move by the group, Keep the Promise I, comes a week before the Nevada caucuses on the Republican side — a key test for Mr. Cruz and his allies, who are hoping to capitalize on Donald J. Trump’s perceived weakness in ground organization.

A spokeswoman said the group had 13 paid staff members and about 75 canvassers in the state.

While Mr. Trump has significant holdings and impeccable name recognition in Nevada, his loss in Iowa, another caucus state, has left questions about his capacity to efficiently turn out voters in states where organization matters more than advertising. 

Mr. Cruz’s campaign and super PAC network have invested heavily on the ground in states across the primary calendar.

Keep the Promise I said it was hiring Nathan Emens, a local operative, to oversee its Nevada ground game. The group also plans to distribute 100,000 mail pieces in the state this week highlighting Marco Rubio’s “less than conservative record on immigration, cap-and-trade, military spending and Libya.”

“You are only as good as the company you keep…” the mailer reads, with Mr. Rubio, a senator from Florida, pictured beside images of Hillary Clinton and Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Harry Reid of Nevada.

The two television spots in the ad buy are mostly positive, focusing on Mr. Cruz, though one does feature an ominous photo of Mr. Rubio as Mr. Cruz is heard saying, “Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats but to leaders in our own party?”",9.2,9.1,61.67,0.0,The New York Times
20,20,1590,Sanders surpasses 2015 fundraising goal with sizable haul,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/02/politics/bernie-sanders-fundraising-hillary-clinton/index.html,sanders,cnn,Campaign Finance,9.9,10.0,"Amherst, Massachusetts (CNN) Bernie Sanders raised $33 million in the final three months of 2015, his campaign said in a statement Saturday, failing to outraise Hillary Clinton but smashing the goal aides set when the Vermont senator launched his campaign back in May.
Sanders' haul -- which brings his 2015 total to $73 million -- was almost exclusively buoyed by his prodigious online fundraising operation. Aides told CNN that Sanders received over 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.
Clinton's campaign announced Friday that it raised $37 million for the primary campaign in the last three months of 2015, easily surpassing the $100 million goal the campaign had set earlier in the year.
""This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,"" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement on Saturday. ""What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support. We are making history and we are proud of it."" 
The final quarter of 2015 also saw Sanders dramatically increase his spending. According to aides, the campaign ended 2015 with $28.4 million cash on hand. That is only $2 million more than the $26.2 million the campaign had in the bank at the end of the third quarter of 2015, meaning Sanders' operation spent the bulk of what they raised in the fourth quarter.
Much of that spending, according to aides, was focused on building infrastructure in early primary states, including deploying organizers to South Carolina and Nevada, and building the campaign's already existing organization in Iowa and New Hampshire.
For the year, Sanders' campaign spent 61% of the money it brought in.
 
Sanders has long been a formidable fundraiser with deep roots in online and small donor fundraising, but even some of his closest aides were unsure he could raise the money needed to run a presidential campaign when the launched earlier this year. Tad Devine, his top strategist, said that the operation had hoped to bring in between $40 and $50 million by the end of 2015.
Sanders smashed that goal, but in a dramatically different way than Clinton did.
A bulk of Clinton's haul came from fundraisers she or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, personally headlined. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. And the former president headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter.
According to CNN's analysis, fundraisers personally headlined by Clinton brought in at least $22 million in the forth quarter.
Sanders, however, only headlined two fundraisers in the last three months of 2015, bringing his year total to nine, while Clinton's total for the year was 174.
What's more, almost all of Sanders' donors have yet to reach the $2,700 max donation, according to aides, who said Saturday that only around 600 Sanders supporters have maxed out.
That means Sanders' campaign can continue to hit up their donors for small donations as the primary calendar moves along.
Sanders' campaign has also raised big money at notable moments in the fourth quarter. Sanders' aides bragged that the campaign raised $2.5 million in the two days after the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas.
And the day after the campaign breached the Clinton campaign's voter data -- and subsequently sued the Democratic National Committee -- aides said the campaign raised more than $1 million.",9.6,9.5,60.65,-0.4,CNN
